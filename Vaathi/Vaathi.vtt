2
00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:02.266
You have to buy the uniforms from us.

3
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.433
And you have to pay extra
for it by the end of this month.

4
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:07.333
Only 20 percent
can be paid through check.

5
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.466
The balance must be paid in cash.

6
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.566
-Okay.
-Yeah. next?

7
00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.233
-NEET. right? Give it.
-Yes. sir.

8
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.566
<i>Sin²x + Cos²x is equal to</i>

9
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.766
<i>Sin²x + Cos²x(1- Sin²x)</i>

10
00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:25.566
If. <i>fx = Cos²x</i>

11
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.233
Then <i>f(2022)</i> is how much?

12
00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:30.300
Use the formula to find the solution.

13
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Today’s homework.

14
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.000
Please write it down.

15
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.233
Bring it on Monday.

16
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.233
Is the class over?

17
00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:41.266
I didn't understand a thing.

18
00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:42.466
And he has given homework as well.

19
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.600
Tell me what can be done.

20
00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:49.600
Abi…

21
00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:51.266
sign here.

22
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.733
Mom. who is he?

23
00:02:58.066 --> 00:02:59.466
We are selling our video shop.

24
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.233
-Why?
-Why?!

25
00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:02.366
What do you expect?

26
00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:06.233
You will never get an engineering seat

27
00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:08.033
with the marks you have scored.

28
00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:09.066
So. we have to buy it.

29
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.766
We don't have the money.
We have to sell something. right?

30
00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:14.666
You never studied when you had to.
And now you're asking us. "why?"

31
00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:18.133
MUTHU BHUPATHI
BORN: 20-06-1953 DIED: 07-10-2010

32
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.700
This was the first video store
in this town.

33
00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:26.100
And it will be the last one too.

34
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.300
This too will cease to exist.

35
00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:28.266
All because of me.

36
00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:29.566
Don’t worry. buddy.

37
00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:32.100
They are selling this
off so that you can become an engineer.

38
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.033
When was the last time
you opened the store?

39
00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:37.100
It is so dusty in here.

40
00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:49.200
-Hey. Abi?
-Yes?

41
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.733
Check out your grandpa’s collections.

42
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.033
-Maybe. it's not his collection.
-Stop bluffing. man.

43
00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:54.466
It's a very rare collection. man!

44
00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.233
You can't find these even on the internet.

45
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.033
-Let's look for more.
-Yes.

46
00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:01.466
What is this?

47
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.500
What is that?
Why has he kept these hidden?

48
00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:27.633
Let me see.

49
00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:29.600
It must be some heroine’s X-rated movie.

50
00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:32.333
-Heroine…
-That’s why your grandpa has hidden it.

51
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.500
Yeah!

52
00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:35.133
-Bring the TV.
-Okay.

53
00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:44.766
-Hey. lower the volume! Lower it!
-Yes.

54
00:04:52.666 --> 00:04:53.700
Who is he. buddy?

55
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.033
Hero!

56
00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:00.233
Why is he taking a class?

57
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.200
Hey. this is a vintage video.

58
00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:04.066
They take their sweet time.

59
00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:05.600
They will eventually come to the point.

60
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.366
First. they give us the story.

61
00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:08.500
Then. the screenplay!

62
00:05:08.633 --> 00:05:10.033
And finally. the steamy scenes!

63
00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:11.366
This is the real deal!

64
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.433
Hey. how much more?

65
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.566
Just fast-forward the video.

66
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.733
Yes.

67
00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:26.066
-Hey! One minute!
-Yes.

68
00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:28.366
Rewind it.

69
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.600
Now pause it.

70
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.600
Wasn't this given
to us as homework in class today?

71
00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:34.033
-What?
-Homework?

72
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.600
Increase the volume and play again.

73
00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:47.100
<i>f(x) = Cos²x + (1- Cos²x)²</i>

74
00:05:47.233 --> 00:05:50.066
<i>Sin²x + Cos^4x</i>

75
00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:54.366
Cos²x +…

76
00:06:00.633 --> 00:06:03.100
You have to use <i>(a - b)^2</i> formula here…

77
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.266
<i>Sin²x</i> plus…

78
00:06:08.366 --> 00:06:09.600
What a teacher!

79
00:06:11.566 --> 00:06:13.433
-Yes. man.
-Who is he?

80
00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:32.033
A.M. Kumar.

81
00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:33.566
Fourth May. 2000.

82
00:06:34.066 --> 00:06:35.066
Sozhavaram?

83
00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:36.400
Where is this place?

84
00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:40.766
-It is just 40 kilometers from here.
-Should we go there?

85
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.300
For what. man?

86
00:06:42.566 --> 00:06:46.200
If we go to this man for tuition.
I truly believe we can score well.

87
00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:47.766
This way our parents can
save some money too.

88
00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:49.166
-Really?
-Yeah.

89
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.600
CHOLAVARAM 5 KM

90
00:06:52.533 --> 00:06:55.333
GOVERNMENT HIGH SCHOOL

91
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.766
WELCOME TO CHOLAVARAM

92
00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:04.433
Where is A.M. Kumar's house?

93
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500
Kumar. they are looking for your house.

94
00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:11.100
Hey. kiddo. not him.

95
00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:13.166
He is an elderly man.
He must be around 50 years old.

96
00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:17.233
There are a lot of Kumars in this village.
Which Kumar are you looking for?

97
00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:19.400
Madam. about 20 years ago…

98
00:07:19.466 --> 00:07:20.733
There was a teacher named Kumar.

99
00:07:21.133 --> 00:07:23.733
You can ask the peon
who worked in the government school.

100
00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:27.600
He was not a teacher.

101
00:07:27.766 --> 00:07:29.166
He was a student in our school.

102
00:07:29.266 --> 00:07:30.533
He pays a visit once in a while.

103
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.066
Where is he now?

104
00:07:32.366 --> 00:07:33.300
In Andhra.

105
00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:35.033
He is the Kadapa District Collector.

106
00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:38.166
Collector?

107
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.600
Will he take tuition for us?

108
00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:44.566
Let's give it a try.

109
00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.200
Excuse me?

110
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.500
-Yeah. tell me.
-We've come from Vellore.

111
00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:02.300
We just want to meet the Collector.

112
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.700
3 HOURS LATER

113
00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:17.000
It's not him.
Come. let’s leave.

114
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.266
Hey. he is the Collector.

115
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.233
So what? He's not the person we came for.

116
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.766
Hey! He is looking at us.

117
00:08:22.033 --> 00:08:23.433
Hello? What is it?

118
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.566
Who are you guys?

119
00:08:25.666 --> 00:08:26.566
Come here.

120
00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:29.166
You cannot come
and go at your will.

121
00:08:29.266 --> 00:08:30.200
What is the problem?

122
00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:33.166
Sir. we have come from Vellore.

123
00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:34.433
Okay?

124
00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:39.066
Recently. we were vacating
his grandpa’s video shop…

125
00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:42.433
Video shop?

126
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.766
What is the name of your grandpa?

127
00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:46.166
Sir. Bhupathi.

128
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.633
Are you Mr. Bhupathi’s grandson?

129
00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:49.233
Come. sit down.

130
00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:55.066
When I was studying in school.
I was very close to your grandpa.

131
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.400
I came to your house
to attend his funeral.

132
00:08:58.766 --> 00:09:00.633
I think you were
studying in the fourth or fifth class.

133
00:09:00.733 --> 00:09:01.666
Fourth class. sir.

134
00:09:02.266 --> 00:09:04.000
Okay. tell me. what do you want?

135
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.633
When we were cleaning his store.
we came across these cassettes.

136
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.333
When we played them.
we saw a person taking classes.

137
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.666
When we kept looking further.
we found a card.

138
00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:19.400
Your name was on that card.

139
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.600
That’s why we…

140
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.166
Who is the person in that video?

141
00:09:33.466 --> 00:09:34.633
My teacher.

142
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.600
Bala sir.

143
00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:17.266
<i>During the 1990s</i>
<i>the income of our country</i>

144
00:10:17.466 --> 00:10:19.233
<i>increased due to the privatization policy.</i>

145
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.500
<i>The living standard</i>
<i>of our people improved.</i>

146
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.533
<i>And everyone believed that education</i>
<i>will make their lives better.</i>

147
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.666
<i>The demand for professional courses</i>
<i>like engineering and medicine went up.</i>

148
00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:31.133
<i>Seeing the demand.</i>
<i>some people decided to capitalize on this</i>

149
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.300
<i>and turned education into a business.</i>

150
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.700
<i>They started TNPCEE coaching centers</i>

151
00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:39.366
<i>and began to monetize</i>
<i>the frenzy of people around education.</i>

152
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.433
In the name of quality of education.
they raised the fees in their schools.

153
00:10:43.533 --> 00:10:48.433
<i>At the same time. the State Government</i>
<i>couldn’t run the government schools.</i>

154
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.766
<i>The government couldn’t even pay salaries</i>
<i>to the teachers.</i>

155
00:10:52.133 --> 00:10:55.000
<i>So those teachers went</i>
<i>to work in private schools</i>

156
00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.433
<i>and TNPCEE coaching centers. which paid</i>
<i>high salaries to experienced teachers.</i>

157
00:11:00.633 --> 00:11:04.333
<i>Due to the lack of teachers.</i>
<i>government schools were shut down.</i>

158
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.766
<i>So. education became a dream</i>
<i>for many underprivileged students.</i>

159
00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:12.166
<i>So their parents started a protest.</i>

160
00:11:12.233 --> 00:11:14.300
<i>The leaders of the opposition</i>
<i>parties joined them.</i>

161
00:11:14.366 --> 00:11:16.566
<i>They all protested against</i>
<i>the closure of government schools</i>

162
00:11:16.666 --> 00:11:18.666
<i>and the money-grubbing</i>
<i>attitude of private schools.</i>

163
00:11:18.733 --> 00:11:20.366
-Education Minister!
-Down. down!

164
00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:22.100
-Education Minister!
-Stop it. man!

165
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.133
Hey. stop it.

166
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.533
THE PROTEST STARTED BY NARAYANASAMY

167
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.466
Can the middle class afford all this?

168
00:11:27.633 --> 00:11:28.533
Listen. man!

169
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.400
I finished my entire education
for just 5.000 rupees.

170
00:11:30.466 --> 00:11:31.400
Silence!

171
00:11:32.533 --> 00:11:33.666
<i>Srinivas Thirupathi.</i>

172
00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:35.766
<i>Founder of the Thirupathi School</i>
<i>and Coaching Center.</i>

173
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.433
<i>and the President</i>
<i>of Private Schools Association.</i>

174
00:11:42.033 --> 00:11:44.300
<i>The government was struggling</i>
<i>to run higher secondary schools.</i>

175
00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:46.066
<i>So. to dodge the blame…</i>

176
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.700
they were planning
to pass the fees regulation bill.

177
00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:51.700
<i>This would close many private</i>
<i>schools and coaching centers.</i>

178
00:11:52.433 --> 00:11:55.133
<i>Thirupathi somehow found out about this.</i>
<i>and to counter it.</i>

179
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.000
<i>he came up with a master plan.</i>

180
00:11:58.166 --> 00:12:00.033
A man with a dangerous vision.

181
00:12:00.366 --> 00:12:03.566
If he were Dronacharya.
he would have demanded

182
00:12:04.133 --> 00:12:07.333
all the ten fingers of Ekalyva
as his fee.

183
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.300
All the private higher secondary schools

184
00:12:09.366 --> 00:12:11.166
will work along with
the government schools.

185
00:12:11.366 --> 00:12:14.033
<i>All the government schools</i>
<i>in our area without teachers</i>

186
00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:16.033
<i>will be adopted</i>
<i>by the Private Schools Association.</i>

187
00:12:16.533 --> 00:12:19.200
<i>We will send our best teachers there.</i>

188
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.500
<i>We will provide quality education.</i>

189
00:12:20.566 --> 00:12:22.033
I WILL ADOPT GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS
SRINIVAS THIRUPATHI

190
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.233
-How can this happen?
-We will be at loss.

191
00:12:26.533 --> 00:12:28.233
-This is intolerance.
-We cannot agree to this.

192
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.400
Silence!

193
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.166
Why are you so scared?

194
00:12:31.433 --> 00:12:32.366
What is this. Thirupathi?

195
00:12:32.566 --> 00:12:35.200
How can you promise
such things on a live telecast?

196
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.366
I said. silence!

197
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.166
When I go to a temple.
I don’t even give alms to a beggar.

198
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.433
Then how will I do something
that will bring me loss?

199
00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:47.666
According to our country.

200
00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:49.433
education is a non-profitable service.

201
00:12:50.266 --> 00:12:53.233
We can do this business
because of little loopholes.

202
00:12:53.533 --> 00:12:57.200
A single "fees regulation bill"
can finish all of us.

203
00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.666
So. Mr. Srinivasan?

204
00:12:59.733 --> 00:13:01.166
Seenu Coaching Center.

205
00:13:01.433 --> 00:13:03.166
Forty-five thousand fees per annum.

206
00:13:03.266 --> 00:13:04.600
Will it be okay
if they send you a notice

207
00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:06.033
asking you to cap the fees at 6.000?

208
00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:09.200
What about you. Mr. IIT Ramanan?

209
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.266
You accept 80 percent
of your fees only in cash.

210
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.233
Black.

211
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.300
Can you face an IT raid
at this age?

212
00:13:15.533 --> 00:13:19.700
But Thirupathi.
if we send our best teachers.

213
00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:22.100
just like you promised.
to government schools.

214
00:13:22.433 --> 00:13:24.333
who will come to private schools?

215
00:13:24.466 --> 00:13:25.766
Use your brain. Sudhakar.

216
00:13:27.233 --> 00:13:29.333
Who said that we will be sending
our best teachers?

217
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.466
I don’t get you.

218
00:13:30.533 --> 00:13:33.400
We are going to send third-grade
assistant teachers.

219
00:13:40.466 --> 00:13:43.600
Those who are substitutes
for senior teachers

220
00:13:43.733 --> 00:13:46.066
and clear doubts during study hours.

221
00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:50.466
And those who stand in as night watchmen
at the student’s hostel.

222
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.733
It was a volleyball bet. sir.

223
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.333
First. they asked for 100 rupees.

224
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.500
But now they want 1.000 rupees.

225
00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:22.166
Sir. it was…

226
00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.300
Brother?

227
00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:28.733
Play it that side.

228
00:14:29.333 --> 00:14:30.266
Good day. brother.

229
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.300
What?

230
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.733
My name is Bala.

231
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.333
Balamurugan.

232
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.400
I am an assistant teacher at
Thirupathi Education Institution.

233
00:14:39.466 --> 00:14:40.366
Maths.

234
00:14:41.033 --> 00:14:42.733
They are my students.

235
00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:43.733
So?

236
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.566
They played a bet match by mistake.

237
00:14:45.633 --> 00:14:47.700
If you can forgive them this once…

238
00:14:48.033 --> 00:14:49.200
Pay the money
and take them along.

239
00:14:49.366 --> 00:14:50.333
One minute.

240
00:14:52.366 --> 00:14:53.300
How much do you have?

241
00:14:54.533 --> 00:14:55.466
Give it to me.

242
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.466
We have 100 rupees with us.

243
00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:14.000
Brother. we have about 600 rupees.

244
00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:16.233
Accept this and leave the kids.

245
00:15:16.466 --> 00:15:17.566
Please. for my sake.

246
00:15:17.633 --> 00:15:19.033
-Please!
-Get lost.

247
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.400
Thank you. brother.
Love you. brother.

248
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.433
Good night. brother.

249
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.066
This is what you do during study hours?

250
00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.033
Silly fellows!

251
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.633
Come on.

252
00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:34.366
Injuries are common in sports.
Come on.

253
00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.333
Sir. this was not due to sports.
They hit us.

254
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.233
Did you give 100 instead of 1000?

255
00:15:39.566 --> 00:15:41.733
-Confiscate their cycle keys and bags.
-Brother. please leave us.

256
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.300
Don’t let them go
till we get the money.

257
00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:51.033
-Brother?
-Yeah?

258
00:15:51.366 --> 00:15:52.600
Did you hit my students?

259
00:15:53.066 --> 00:15:54.266
Yes. I did. So what?

260
00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:09.466
Sir. why did you hit him?

261
00:16:09.533 --> 00:16:10.600
They might cause trouble. sir

262
00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:12.766
-Sir. come. Let’s go.
-Sir. they are closing in.

263
00:16:13.033 --> 00:16:13.766
Be careful with the pen.

264
00:17:18.466 --> 00:17:21.733
Hey. get hold of the boys.
Only then will he come under control.

265
00:17:41.633 --> 00:17:42.700
-Watch.
-Sir.

266
00:17:44.733 --> 00:17:45.700
My pen?

267
00:17:49.133 --> 00:17:50.033
Sir!

268
00:17:53.466 --> 00:17:54.733
There is a God. Kumar!

269
00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:57.366
<i>Good morning everyone.</i>

270
00:17:57.533 --> 00:17:59.433
<i>We have invited you all here for a reason.</i>

271
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.333
On behalf
of the Private Schools Association.

272
00:18:02.733 --> 00:18:05.566
we are going to run all the
government schools in our state.

273
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.033
We are going
to send you all as faculties there.

274
00:18:08.233 --> 00:18:09.133
Will we get a raise?

275
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.600
We will continue with the same salary.

276
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.133
Your center result will speak
of your performance.

277
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.666
You will be rewarded
according to the results.

278
00:18:18.233 --> 00:18:19.633
Sir. what will you give as a reward?

279
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.600
Who was that?

280
00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:21.633
Sir!

281
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.366
Sir. myself…

282
00:18:25.433 --> 00:18:27.200
-Balamurugan. Adyar branch.
-Hey!

283
00:18:27.633 --> 00:18:29.400
-Sir. you said you'll give us a reward.
-Yeah.

284
00:18:29.466 --> 00:18:32.300
If you tell us what it is.
it will be encouraging to all of us.

285
00:18:32.366 --> 00:18:33.700
What do you want?
Ask for it.

286
00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:39.033
Sir. if we really give good results.
then give us a promotion.

287
00:18:48.133 --> 00:18:49.066
Alright.

288
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.033
If all the students in your school
pass your subject…

289
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.266
I will give you the promotion
that you so desire.

290
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.233
Okay. sir.

291
00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:05.400
Super. sir.

292
00:19:05.766 --> 00:19:06.766
Thank you. sir.

293
00:19:08.566 --> 00:19:10.200
Sir. are you really going
to promote them?

294
00:19:11.433 --> 00:19:14.433
Last month my driver threatened
to quit his job

295
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.100
If I didn’t give him a raise.

296
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.633
I promised to give him a raise
if he drove for a month with no accidents.

297
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.533
All these years. he was driving
without a single mishap.

298
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.300
But this month.
there were three dents in the car.

299
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.666
If we don’t have the heart to be generous.

300
00:19:29.733 --> 00:19:31.466
we must exert pressure on them.

301
00:19:31.666 --> 00:19:34.100
Or burden them with impossible tasks.

302
00:19:35.233 --> 00:19:36.600
Hey! Did you switch on the AC?

303
00:19:36.666 --> 00:19:37.566
Yes. sir.

304
00:19:38.666 --> 00:19:40.433
Nowadays. he never speaks of salary.

305
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.400
He is happy as long as I don’t fire him.

306
00:19:43.733 --> 00:19:45.300
They will also meet the same fate.

307
00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:47.233
Don’t worry.

308
00:19:47.733 --> 00:19:48.666
Leave.

309
00:19:53.466 --> 00:19:54.666
-Okay?
-Okay. sir.

310
00:19:54.733 --> 00:19:58.466
When this wheel circulates.
this small one…

311
00:19:58.533 --> 00:20:00.000
How much chili powder should I add?

312
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.433
Two teaspoons.

313
00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:06.266
Bala?

314
00:20:07.533 --> 00:20:08.466
Where is he?

315
00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:10.533
-He's leaving tomorrow. right?
-Yes.

316
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.533
So he went to Ansari's house.

317
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.000
Uncle. what is this?

318
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.366
Recently I received my provident fund.

319
00:20:22.433 --> 00:20:24.766
With that. I bought three acres
of land in Ooty.

320
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.433
Rich man!

321
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.366
Let me get promoted
then I too will splurge like this.

322
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.100
-Bala?
-Yes.

323
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.733
-Do remember one thing.
-Tell me.

324
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.300
Being a teacher is not a job.

325
00:20:35.566 --> 00:20:36.566
It is a responsibility.

326
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.333
The life of your students
is more valuable than your salary.

327
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.733
Look. who is talking?

328
00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:44.733
Gandhi?

329
00:20:46.066 --> 00:20:47.466
What do you know?

330
00:20:47.666 --> 00:20:50.400
You are a single man
who can take free classes

331
00:20:50.766 --> 00:20:52.333
and can buy property in hill stations.

332
00:20:52.533 --> 00:20:53.500
I am not like you.

333
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.200
I have a lot of responsibilities.

334
00:20:56.533 --> 00:20:59.533
Fine. I will give you my property.

335
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.400
Will you take free classes then?

336
00:21:03.033 --> 00:21:05.100
First. you transfer your property to me.
Then I'll see.

337
00:21:11.633 --> 00:21:12.533
Sir?

338
00:21:12.666 --> 00:21:13.600
Bala sir?

339
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.000
Oh. God!

340
00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:16.233
He has started again!

341
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.233
-Hey. my son. Bala sir?
-Yeah!

342
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.200
Bala sir?

343
00:21:19.266 --> 00:21:20.366
Sir. please sit down.

344
00:21:20.633 --> 00:21:21.733
How many times to tell you?

345
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.200
Why do you address me as "Sir"?

346
00:21:24.066 --> 00:21:25.533
I am Driver Narayanan.

347
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.466
All these years. I have addressed
many people as "Sir" with disdain.

348
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.333
But today.
an entire school calls my son "Sir."

349
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.000
So. I too want to call you "Sir."

350
00:21:38.266 --> 00:21:39.200
Bala sir!

351
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.566
Dad. your son is not a big sir.

352
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.700
He is a small sir.

353
00:21:43.166 --> 00:21:44.533
That is not something great.

354
00:21:44.733 --> 00:21:47.166
Anyone who provides education is great.

355
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.166
Hail Goddess Adiparasakthi!

356
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.233
Hail Goddess Kamatchi!

357
00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:54.466
Mom. I'll take your leave.

358
00:22:02.333 --> 00:22:03.233
Balamurugan. sir.

359
00:22:09.033 --> 00:22:09.766
Brother?

360
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.366
-Shall we go?
-Where to?

361
00:22:11.466 --> 00:22:13.333
Hello. stop smoking and start the car.

362
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.433
-Let’s go.
-Yes. come. Let’s go.

363
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.266
Hey! I am not a driver.

364
00:22:16.433 --> 00:22:18.033
-I am the driver.
-Oh. you?

365
00:22:18.133 --> 00:22:19.466
You look like a driver.
That confused me.

366
00:22:19.566 --> 00:22:20.766
Balamurugan. maths teacher.

367
00:22:21.266 --> 00:22:23.033
Karthik. chemistry.
Royal Higher Secondary School.

368
00:22:23.266 --> 00:22:24.500
I am Prakash Reddy. Physics.

369
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.633
-I am from Pondicherry.
-Hello!

370
00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:29.100
Brother. recently I have undergone
a hydrocele operation.

371
00:22:29.466 --> 00:22:30.466
So. I must not lift weights.

372
00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:32.300
-Can you help me with this?
-Oh. God!

373
00:22:32.666 --> 00:22:34.166
Yes. I will handle it. brother.

374
00:22:34.233 --> 00:22:35.166
No problem.

375
00:22:35.233 --> 00:22:36.133
Operation?

376
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.266
Then are you allowed to smoke?

377
00:22:37.366 --> 00:22:39.066
No. but it has become a habit.

378
00:22:39.133 --> 00:22:40.433
What to do?
But it's a bad habit.

379
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.533
You smoke away!

380
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.033
<i>I am a nomadic king</i>

381
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.600
<i>Follow my path</i>

382
00:22:45.766 --> 00:22:47.533
<i>There will be no harm</i>

383
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.133
<i>Thaa le lo!</i>

384
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.166
-Why are you wearing a school uniform?
<i>-Like a caring mother</i>

385
00:22:51.266 --> 00:22:53.033
-Respect.
<i>-The sky comes along with me</i>

386
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.666
<i>I don’t want anything else</i>

387
00:22:54.733 --> 00:22:56.366
<i>Thaa le lo!</i>

388
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.266
<i>Even though I am in the pit</i>

389
00:22:58.366 --> 00:23:00.100
<i>My heart is in a palanquin</i>

390
00:23:00.166 --> 00:23:01.533
<i>When I see the needy and helpless</i>

391
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.500
<i>I become so generous</i>

392
00:23:03.566 --> 00:23:05.333
<i>I am like the ten-headed Ravana</i>

393
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.100
<i>A booming war cry</i>

394
00:23:07.233 --> 00:23:09.000
<i>When I sing to the tune</i>

395
00:23:09.066 --> 00:23:10.600
<i>Even I become the poet of poets</i>

396
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.433
<i>There is food on my plate</i>

397
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.133
<i>There is water in my glass</i>

398
00:23:14.266 --> 00:23:15.666
<i>No matter what happens</i>

399
00:23:15.733 --> 00:23:17.766
<i>I do not shed any tears</i>

400
00:23:18.033 --> 00:23:19.533
<i>There are a hundred stars</i>

401
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.266
<i>On my forehead. look!</i>

402
00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:22.733
<i>When you go the way</i>
<i>You have come</i>

403
00:23:23.033 --> 00:23:25.433
<i>There is no need to fear</i>
<i>Go ahead!</i>

404
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.733
Somehow I must ensure
all the students pass.

405
00:23:38.233 --> 00:23:39.566
Then I will definitely get a promotion.

406
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.533
Brother?

407
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600
Why are you sleeping?

408
00:23:42.666 --> 00:23:44.533
-No! I was listening.
-No. you were sleeping.

409
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.300
-I will start again.
-No. I heard everything.

410
00:23:46.366 --> 00:23:47.533
-Listen to me. brother.
-Oh. God…

411
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.533
Wake him up.

412
00:23:49.066 --> 00:23:50.700
Yes. I will. Hey?

413
00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:52.433
Wake up.
Or else he will start from the beginning.

414
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.533
<i>I am the wild river</i>

415
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.533
<i>That travels the world</i>

416
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.233
<i>The place where I stand</i>

417
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.233
<i>Becomes my hometown</i>

418
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.100
<i>Those who don’t worry about castes</i>

419
00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:05.700
<i>Become my people</i>

420
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.566
<i>If you try to cross my way</i>

421
00:24:07.633 --> 00:24:09.366
<i>I shall show my true nature</i>

422
00:24:09.433 --> 00:24:11.000
<i>Even if he gets a little</i>

423
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.666
<i>He shares what he has</i>

424
00:24:13.033 --> 00:24:14.400
<i>When he is with us</i>

425
00:24:14.466 --> 00:24:16.466
<i>Every day becomes a good one</i>

426
00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:18.233
<i>Let the abused and the poor</i>

427
00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:20.066
<i>Reach great heights</i>

428
00:24:20.133 --> 00:24:21.500
<i>Let’s stand at the forefront</i>

429
00:24:21.566 --> 00:24:24.300
<i>-And strive together for them</i>
-Hey. stop!

430
00:24:26.066 --> 00:24:29.066
Sir? Are you the teachers
from the city?

431
00:24:29.133 --> 00:24:30.400
I am the government school peon. sir.

432
00:24:31.433 --> 00:24:33.600
Why do you speak
a mix of Tamil and Telugu?

433
00:24:34.133 --> 00:24:35.500
This is the Andhra border. sir.

434
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.000
This is how we speak here.

435
00:24:37.066 --> 00:24:40.266
Like me. most of the people here
speak Telugu. Please come.

436
00:24:40.633 --> 00:24:43.100
Muthu. don’t you have
some other place to sleep?!

437
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.100
Get up and get lost!

438
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200
-Brother?
-Go over there!

439
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.700
Why are you beating him?
He is leaving.

440
00:24:47.133 --> 00:24:49.266
He will leave only if I tell
him this way.

441
00:24:50.533 --> 00:24:51.433
You come. sir.

442
00:24:52.366 --> 00:24:53.500
There are three rooms in total.

443
00:24:54.133 --> 00:24:55.566
That room alone has
an attached bathroom.

444
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.566
The other rooms have
a bathroom outside.

445
00:24:57.733 --> 00:24:59.500
-I'll see you at school tomorrow. Bye.
-Okay.

446
00:25:02.433 --> 00:25:04.466
Brother. since I’ve undergone
a hydrocele operation.

447
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.633
My body needs some comfort.

448
00:25:06.766 --> 00:25:08.033
So. I will do one thing.

449
00:25:08.266 --> 00:25:10.200
I will take that bedroom
with an attached bathroom.

450
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.400
Okay? Bye. bro.

451
00:25:11.466 --> 00:25:12.366
Hey. enough with it!

452
00:25:12.433 --> 00:25:13.566
Why are you yapping
about hydrocele?

453
00:25:13.633 --> 00:25:15.533
Is it cancer or a tumor?
It is just a swelling. right?

454
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.100
Karthik brother. relax.

455
00:25:17.233 --> 00:25:18.133
Listen to him. brother.

456
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.533
He chews tobacco and smokes cigarettes.

457
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.633
What kind of a patient is he?!

458
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.200
Hey. buck-tooth!

459
00:25:23.266 --> 00:25:24.666
That room is mine.

460
00:25:24.733 --> 00:25:26.000
Hey. mind your own words!

461
00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:28.066
I got this tooth from my grandma.

462
00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:29.466
You can be proud
of your grandma's teeth.

463
00:25:29.533 --> 00:25:30.433
Why should I?

464
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.466
How dare you talk about
my family in front of me?

465
00:25:33.533 --> 00:25:35.133
Get lost with your "Butler English."

466
00:25:35.466 --> 00:25:36.766
-This is spoken English.
-Stop it!

467
00:25:37.033 --> 00:25:37.766
Both are the same.

468
00:25:38.033 --> 00:25:39.233
Stop it. guys!

469
00:25:40.433 --> 00:25:42.100
Why do you squabble like kids?

470
00:25:42.766 --> 00:25:43.700
Who are we?

471
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:45.233
Teachers!

472
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.233
Where's the dignity?

473
00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.200
Yeah.

474
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.366
Fine! Let’s do one thing.

475
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.600
Let’s decide with <i>Inky. Pinky. Ponky.</i>

476
00:25:54.666 --> 00:25:56.133
-Okay?
-Okay.

477
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.266
-Okay?
-Double okay!

478
00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.566
<i>Inky. Pinky. Ponky.</i>

479
00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:00.600
Father had a donkey.

480
00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:02.433
Donkey died. father cried.

481
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.633
<i>Inky. Pinky. Ponky.</i>
You're out. leave!

482
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.633
Donkey. you're out! Go!

483
00:26:05.466 --> 00:26:06.366
Now between us.

484
00:26:06.433 --> 00:26:08.033
<i>-Inky. Pinky. Ponky.</i>
-Okay!

485
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.600
-Father had a donkey.
-Okay!

486
00:26:09.666 --> 00:26:11.533
Donkey died. father cried.
<i>Inky. Pinky. Ponky.</i>

487
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.500
The room is mine.

488
00:26:12.566 --> 00:26:13.566
Yes!

489
00:26:13.666 --> 00:26:15.233
We have school in the morning.
Time for bed.

490
00:26:15.733 --> 00:26:17.166
Good night. brother.
Love you. brother.

491
00:26:17.233 --> 00:26:18.133
Take care. brother.

492
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.433
<i>Inky. Pinky. Ponky.</i>

493
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.533
Father had a…

494
00:26:21.133 --> 00:26:22.766
Anyway. he didn’t get the room.
I am happy.

495
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.233
CHOLAVARAM GOVERNMENT SECONDARY SCHOOL
SOZHAVARAM

496
00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:36.333
Sir. he is the new teacher.

497
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.700
-Good day.
-Hello. sir.

498
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.766
-Give me!
-Hello!

499
00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:40.133
Take now.

500
00:26:42.366 --> 00:26:43.566
Sir. smile. please.

501
00:26:43.633 --> 00:26:44.733
This is nothing like a school.

502
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.066
It is like a wedding ceremony.

503
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.566
Take a video.

504
00:26:54.166 --> 00:26:55.100
Take it properly.

505
00:26:55.233 --> 00:26:56.133
Welcome. sir.

506
00:26:56.533 --> 00:26:59.400
Sir. I am Muthupandian.
The president of this village.

507
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.633
Elected thrice. unanimously.

508
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.333
-Oh. very good. sir!
-Just saying.

509
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.233
My brother-in-law said you're coming.

510
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.000
So. I made all the arrangements myself.

511
00:27:07.133 --> 00:27:08.266
Brother-in-law?

512
00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:09.366
Mr. Thirupathi.

513
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.666
We are distantly related
but very close.

514
00:27:11.733 --> 00:27:12.666
Okay.

515
00:27:12.766 --> 00:27:13.700
He is… not you!

516
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.700
-He is Mr. Sudharshan.
-Welcome. sir.

517
00:27:15.766 --> 00:27:17.633
-Assistant headmaster and English teacher.
-Greetings.

518
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.000
Very intelligent.

519
00:27:19.166 --> 00:27:21.666
He… He is Mr. Thanikachalam.

520
00:27:21.733 --> 00:27:22.733
Headmaster!

521
00:27:23.033 --> 00:27:24.533
-History and Tamil teacher.
-Okay. sir.

522
00:27:26.766 --> 00:27:27.700
Take now.

523
00:27:30.066 --> 00:27:31.200
He is Bittu Bhupathi.

524
00:27:31.266 --> 00:27:32.500
He has a video store in Vellore.

525
00:27:32.633 --> 00:27:35.200
He is our photographer and videographer.

526
00:27:36.366 --> 00:27:38.033
Is Bittu his family name?

527
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.133
No!

528
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.300
There is an X-rated theater
outside our village.

529
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.600
He runs such movies on
Saturdays and Sundays.

530
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.033
That is why the name.

531
00:27:48.633 --> 00:27:49.533
Hi.

532
00:27:50.066 --> 00:27:50.766
Hi.

533
00:27:51.333 --> 00:27:52.233
You take it now.

534
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.566
-Come. I’ll show you the school.
-Okay. sir.

535
00:27:53.666 --> 00:27:56.066
The school just re-opened.

536
00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:58.633
There were no teachers
for the past two years…

537
00:27:58.733 --> 00:28:00.366
There is another school
till 10th standard.

538
00:28:00.433 --> 00:28:02.133
Even here. we have only two sections.

539
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.400
That too for 11th science students.

540
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.500
What about commerce students?

541
00:28:04.566 --> 00:28:05.566
There is no one.

542
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.766
Good. right?

543
00:28:07.333 --> 00:28:09.566
Last year this government
kept us very busy.

544
00:28:09.666 --> 00:28:12.700
We had election duties
and other government work.

545
00:28:12.766 --> 00:28:15.100
But you look like you never do much.

546
00:28:35.633 --> 00:28:36.533
Madam?

547
00:28:39.133 --> 00:28:41.566
Ms. Meenakshi. biology teacher.

548
00:28:42.333 --> 00:28:43.766
Karthik. chemistry teacher.

549
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.666
I am Prakash Reddy. physics…

550
00:28:47.466 --> 00:28:49.600
Bala. mathematics.

551
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.633
She has been working
in our school for the past four years.

552
00:28:54.033 --> 00:28:56.100
She had many offers
from private schools.

553
00:28:56.166 --> 00:28:57.666
But she didn’t accept any.

554
00:28:58.633 --> 00:29:00.033
You can continue with your class.

555
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.333
Good morning. sir.

556
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.400
Good morning.

557
00:29:05.466 --> 00:29:06.566
Sit down.

558
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.466
This class is full. right?

559
00:29:09.733 --> 00:29:11.166
She is my daughter. Mahalakshmi.

560
00:29:11.566 --> 00:29:13.700
Study well and become
an engineer. and make your father proud.

561
00:29:13.766 --> 00:29:14.666
Okay. sir.

562
00:29:15.366 --> 00:29:17.066
We will leave then.
You can continue with your class.

563
00:29:17.133 --> 00:29:18.033
I'll see you. sir.

564
00:29:18.133 --> 00:29:19.300
I'll leave. Let's get going.

565
00:29:19.433 --> 00:29:20.700
-I will see you.
-Okay. sir!

566
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.366
Okay. students. Today is the first day.

567
00:29:26.433 --> 00:29:28.033
So. let’s introduce ourselves.

568
00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:29.300
Hey. Meenakshi is mine!

569
00:29:29.366 --> 00:29:30.466
No way. Meenakshi belongs to me.

570
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.500
-Get lost! I'm telling you she is mine…
-Even I am saying the same thing.

571
00:29:33.566 --> 00:29:35.033
-How dare you?
-I cannot leave her.

572
00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.500
Why do you squabble like kids?

573
00:29:37.766 --> 00:29:38.700
Who are we?

574
00:29:39.533 --> 00:29:40.433
-Teachers.
-Teachers.

575
00:29:40.533 --> 00:29:41.433
Correct.

576
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.000
Where's the dignity?

577
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.333
Yes.

578
00:29:44.466 --> 00:29:45.666
-Prakash Reddy.
-Yes?

579
00:29:46.133 --> 00:29:47.200
You move out of his way.

580
00:29:47.366 --> 00:29:48.333
-What?
-Yes!

581
00:29:48.533 --> 00:29:51.700
Karthik. you move out
of his way as well. Okay?

582
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.600
You are pushing us out
so you can go ahead. right?

583
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.400
What an excellent brain!

584
00:29:56.466 --> 00:29:57.366
Yes. that’s the plan!

585
00:29:59.066 --> 00:30:01.333
Hey. Maths.
this is a triangular love story.

586
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.766
Don’t turn it into a rectangle.

587
00:30:03.133 --> 00:30:04.200
Get out of our way.

588
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.000
How dare you touch Mr. Chemistry?

589
00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.333
I am going to buy a two-bedroom
apartment in two years.

590
00:30:11.433 --> 00:30:14.000
My mom and Meenakshi will be
cooking in that kitchen.

591
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.000
Just get out of my way. or else…

592
00:30:17.066 --> 00:30:18.566
Shall we play <i>Inky. Pinky. Ponky.</i> brother?

593
00:30:19.433 --> 00:30:20.333
What?

594
00:30:20.633 --> 00:30:22.500
<i>Inky. Pinky. Ponky?</i>

595
00:30:24.133 --> 00:30:26.700
Is this a bedroom
with an attached bathroom?

596
00:30:27.733 --> 00:30:28.633
Love!

597
00:30:29.033 --> 00:30:30.700
Meenakshi madam is special.

598
00:30:31.366 --> 00:30:33.066
Get out of my way. kiddo!

599
00:30:34.233 --> 00:30:35.633
-Okay. brother?
-Okay.

600
00:30:36.266 --> 00:30:37.433
Good night. brother.

601
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.600
Take care. brother.

602
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.533
What is this Prakash Reddy?
We were taken for a ride!

603
00:31:09.233 --> 00:31:10.566
It is fun to while away time like this.

604
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.200
If this continues.

605
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.633
then these tables
and chairs will rot away.

606
00:31:17.366 --> 00:31:20.300
Brother. no one will come to school.

607
00:31:20.466 --> 00:31:21.466
So. every day is a holiday.

608
00:31:21.533 --> 00:31:22.700
Yes. and every day is a jolly day.

609
00:31:22.766 --> 00:31:24.400
Sunday to Monday is a holiday.

610
00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:25.700
We don’t have any work.

611
00:31:26.266 --> 00:31:27.533
But yesterday. there were students.

612
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.666
Since you were coming yesterday.

613
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.366
the students who had already cleared
the tenth class were called in urgently

614
00:31:32.433 --> 00:31:33.733
by the president to fill the classrooms.

615
00:31:34.366 --> 00:31:36.166
He took the photos he needed.

616
00:31:36.433 --> 00:31:38.466
He got the publicity that he wanted.

617
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.666
Here. take a look.

618
00:31:39.733 --> 00:31:40.766
CHOLAVARAM GOVERNMENT
HIGHER SECONDARY SCHOOL REOPENED

619
00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:43.066
You will get used to all this.

620
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.600
<i>Bala sir's dream</i>
<i>to become a permanent teacher</i>

621
00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:55.333
<i>and settle in life was shattered.</i>

622
00:31:56.133 --> 00:31:57.500
<i>He was very depressed.</i>

623
00:32:03.633 --> 00:32:05.100
Check. I have a high score…

624
00:32:07.766 --> 00:32:09.166
-Give that to me.
-No.

625
00:32:24.566 --> 00:32:28.433
This is the only higher secondary
school in this area.

626
00:32:29.066 --> 00:32:30.400
About two years ago.

627
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.400
children from neighboring villages
came here to study.

628
00:32:34.066 --> 00:32:35.100
What happened then?

629
00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:36.333
They shut down the school.

630
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.300
Those who could afford it.
joined the private schools.

631
00:32:41.033 --> 00:32:44.433
And the rest were forced
to take up menial labor jobs.

632
00:32:45.366 --> 00:32:46.633
They too need to survive. right?

633
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.100
But now the school is open.

634
00:32:50.366 --> 00:32:52.133
And we are here to teach them.

635
00:32:52.466 --> 00:32:55.000
What if you leave in a few days?

636
00:32:56.166 --> 00:32:57.533
What if they shut down the school again?

637
00:32:59.266 --> 00:33:02.133
The students showed up on the first day
because they were given snacks.

638
00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:06.500
When they wanted to study.

639
00:33:06.733 --> 00:33:08.433
we couldn’t provide them
with education.

640
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.033
Now you have come.

641
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.533
But they have no faith in you.

642
00:33:15.566 --> 00:33:18.033
Not only them.
but I also don’t believe you.

643
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.333
Why?

644
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.433
How do I make you understand?

645
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.700
Come with me.

646
00:33:29.033 --> 00:33:30.300
Karthik’s book?

647
00:33:31.066 --> 00:33:32.366
Yeah. look at this.

648
00:33:32.733 --> 00:33:34.766
He has played <i>Flames </i>with my name.

649
00:33:35.366 --> 00:33:36.733
Since he got an "S" the first time.

650
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
he changed my name
from Meenakshi to Mynakshi.

651
00:33:41.133 --> 00:33:42.033
Should I trust him?

652
00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.600
Prakash Reddy is not like this.

653
00:33:48.533 --> 00:33:49.433
Oh. the letter!

654
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.233
Bala sir. you too will become
like them in a week.

655
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.500
In a month. you will
complain about living here.

656
00:33:58.566 --> 00:34:00.233
And you will leave this village.

657
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.600
I challenge you!

658
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.500
No madam.

659
00:34:04.766 --> 00:34:06.266
I have come here with ambition.

660
00:34:06.533 --> 00:34:07.466
I will never run away.

661
00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:10.500
Not weeks or months. madam.

662
00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:12.666
In about three days…

663
00:34:14.066 --> 00:34:14.766
That is Monday.

664
00:34:15.166 --> 00:34:18.300
On Monday. all classes
will have full attendance.

665
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.333
Just wait and watch.

666
00:34:20.466 --> 00:34:22.133
I challenge you as well.

667
00:34:22.366 --> 00:34:23.333
Okay. madam.

668
00:34:23.633 --> 00:34:24.533
Thank you. madam.

669
00:34:25.166 --> 00:34:26.133
Take care. madam.

670
00:34:30.233 --> 00:34:31.133
Sir?

671
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.533
Gopika didn’t come to school.

672
00:34:34.033 --> 00:34:35.400
Fritters for sale!

673
00:34:35.533 --> 00:34:36.500
Snacks and fritters for sale!

674
00:34:45.266 --> 00:34:47.433
We have a big family
but not enough income.

675
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.133
We have no other way. sir.

676
00:34:51.266 --> 00:34:53.066
Since the president requested.

677
00:34:53.133 --> 00:34:54.166
I sent her for a day.

678
00:34:54.266 --> 00:34:56.000
But I cannot send her every day.

679
00:34:56.566 --> 00:34:59.000
Lately. she has learned to tailor.
And is earning a few extra pennies

680
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.300
Why should she go
to school again?

681
00:35:00.733 --> 00:35:02.166
Is this Gopal’s house?

682
00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:05.066
He never listens to me. Or else.
I would've never sent him to school.

683
00:35:05.133 --> 00:35:06.366
I would have asked him to get a job.

684
00:35:06.433 --> 00:35:07.766
That rice cake seller. Shymala’s son…

685
00:35:08.033 --> 00:35:09.500
He never listens to me. sir.

686
00:35:09.733 --> 00:35:11.266
That grocery store owner.
Paramasivam’s son.

687
00:35:11.333 --> 00:35:13.333
They all will be playing cards.
Scoundrels!

688
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.466
Sir. he is young.

689
00:35:14.533 --> 00:35:17.233
You just see. once he gets married.
he will change for sure.

690
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.700
My father got a year’s worth
of salary in advance.

691
00:35:19.766 --> 00:35:21.633
If I quit the job.
the village officer will be furious.

692
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.533
-Why aren’t you doing your job?
-Oh. no!

693
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.000
Dad. can I go to school tomorrow?

694
00:35:26.066 --> 00:35:27.766
I made him study till the 10th class.
Isn’t that enough?

695
00:35:28.033 --> 00:35:29.366
We live outside the village.

696
00:35:29.433 --> 00:35:31.233
We can’t even afford the uniforms.

697
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.566
Why do we need education?

698
00:35:32.633 --> 00:35:34.566
School? Then who will
do the household work?

699
00:35:34.666 --> 00:35:35.666
Sir. what to do?

700
00:35:36.066 --> 00:35:37.066
She's my second wife.

701
00:35:37.133 --> 00:35:39.300
My daughter has got
a job in a house in Chennai.

702
00:35:39.366 --> 00:35:40.400
Her salary is 2.000 rupees.

703
00:35:40.466 --> 00:35:42.566
-You…
-Sir. sorry. We cannot send them.

704
00:35:44.466 --> 00:35:45.566
Maths teacher.

705
00:35:45.766 --> 00:35:48.400
it is enough if these girls learn
to read and write.

706
00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:54.000
Then we will get them married
and send them off.

707
00:35:54.566 --> 00:35:55.533
I’m just saying.

708
00:35:58.766 --> 00:36:00.366
Can you do me a favor?

709
00:36:00.633 --> 00:36:02.033
What is this. sir?

710
00:36:02.233 --> 00:36:04.166
You are my brother-in-law’s man.
So. tell me.

711
00:36:04.566 --> 00:36:08.733
Can you call the parents of all those
students who came to school last week?

712
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.200
Fine.

713
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.300
Hey?

714
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.100
-Will they dare disobey us?
-No chance. sir.

715
00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:18.333
Sir. look! The entire village has come.

716
00:36:21.033 --> 00:36:23.266
-Do you know why we are here?
-No!

717
00:36:25.666 --> 00:36:27.733
Sir. when you call for a meeting.
they all show up.

718
00:36:28.533 --> 00:36:30.533
But nobody came to school when I asked.

719
00:36:32.533 --> 00:36:35.000
Many kids here are going to work.

720
00:36:35.533 --> 00:36:37.600
When I asked their parents.

721
00:36:37.733 --> 00:36:39.300
they said that they have to earn.

722
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.433
What is this?

723
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.600
They study to earn right?

724
00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:43.033
Are you saying earning is wrong?

725
00:36:44.633 --> 00:36:46.300
My wife. kids. and I work as laborers

726
00:36:46.366 --> 00:36:48.700
and earn 60 rupees per day.
So that we can eat well.

727
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.366
Do you want me to send my child
to school and let my family starve?

728
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.500
Well said!

729
00:36:55.566 --> 00:36:59.766
Maths teacher.
look at our inspector. Mr. Suresh.

730
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.633
Apart from the bribes.
he earns 4.500 rupees per month.

731
00:37:05.333 --> 00:37:07.400
But our Sethu who sells alcohol…
Yes. him.

732
00:37:07.466 --> 00:37:08.366
What. man?

733
00:37:08.433 --> 00:37:09.666
He is illiterate.

734
00:37:10.566 --> 00:37:15.100
But he earns 500 rupees
every day by selling alcohol.

735
00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.433
He is earning more
than your graduate. right?

736
00:37:18.533 --> 00:37:19.566
Yes. sir.

737
00:37:19.733 --> 00:37:21.666
Then why do we need your education?

738
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.233
Fans!

739
00:37:34.533 --> 00:37:35.433
Alright…

740
00:37:37.066 --> 00:37:38.400
I will tell you a story.

741
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.400
Listen.

742
00:37:39.466 --> 00:37:41.033
CHOLAVARAM VILLAGE COUNCIL

743
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.433
There was a boatman in Rameshwaram.

744
00:37:45.566 --> 00:37:47.633
He had a loving wife
to look after the house.

745
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.433
They had five kids.

746
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.600
It was a poor family.

747
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.166
But somehow.
he educated his kids.

748
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.633
They starved themselves
but fed their children.

749
00:38:00.566 --> 00:38:04.366
There was some magic in the simple
porridge served by the mother.

750
00:38:04.733 --> 00:38:06.766
The last son was very studious.

751
00:38:08.466 --> 00:38:09.566
He came first in his class.

752
00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.566
He studied engineering at
the Madras Institute of Technology.

753
00:38:14.133 --> 00:38:15.600
Then he became a scientist in ISRO.

754
00:38:16.166 --> 00:38:19.200
He was called “The Missile Man.”

755
00:38:19.766 --> 00:38:24.500
He is the one who conducted
the recent nuclear test in Pokhran.

756
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.266
Do you know his name?

757
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.400
A.P. J. Abdul Kalam.

758
00:38:42.066 --> 00:38:44.300
If that boatman had thought…

759
00:38:45.433 --> 00:38:47.333
why should my son study?

760
00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.133
If he accompanies me at my job.

761
00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:53.366
I could make a few extra
trips and earn extra pennies.

762
00:38:54.166 --> 00:38:56.133
Then our country would have
lost a brilliant scientist.

763
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.300
Who is also the pride of our nation.

764
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:05.300
By the way. you addressed
the inspector as “Mr. Suresh.”

765
00:39:05.533 --> 00:39:09.700
But the alcohol seller Sethu
was "Hey. Sethu" to you.

766
00:39:10.733 --> 00:39:11.633
Pandian…

767
00:39:16.333 --> 00:39:17.233
Sir…

768
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.066
you can earn money in many ways.

769
00:39:20.633 --> 00:39:23.533
But only education can earn you respect.

770
00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:29.466
Hey. Veeranna!

771
00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:54.666
Fans!

772
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.333
I am there for you.

773
00:40:05.133 --> 00:40:06.100
I will be there.

774
00:40:07.633 --> 00:40:09.300
The uniform is not compulsory.

775
00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.766
It is enough if you have
the passion to study.

776
00:40:12.333 --> 00:40:13.300
I will take care of the rest.

777
00:40:15.533 --> 00:40:16.466
Come to school.

778
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.000
From tomorrow you have
to go to school.

779
00:40:25.066 --> 00:40:26.366
-Get going.
-Fine. I will go.

780
00:40:26.466 --> 00:40:27.366
Okay. Mom.

781
00:40:27.433 --> 00:40:30.100
No need to work.
go regularly to school.

782
00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.300
Bala sir?

783
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.166
Madam. how is it?

784
00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:37.700
I told you I will bring
the entire class.

785
00:40:37.766 --> 00:40:38.733
Did I not?

786
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.133
Yes! I think you will do a lot
of good things for this school.

787
00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.166
-Hey! Look there!
-Welcome to this school.

788
00:40:44.233 --> 00:40:45.133
Oh my…

789
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.566
What are you waiting for?

790
00:40:56.633 --> 00:40:57.633
They will not come.

791
00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.700
Mr. Sudharshan.

792
00:40:59.266 --> 00:41:03.100
Just because they gave you applause.
you think they'll turn up? They won't!

793
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.333
What is it?

794
00:41:04.666 --> 00:41:06.166
I will not come to work.

795
00:41:06.566 --> 00:41:08.266
Starting today. I will be going to school.

796
00:41:18.633 --> 00:41:21.033
<i>Let’s learn the alphabet. come along</i>

797
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.266
<i>Education is the path to heights</i>

799
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.000
<i>Education is the light of the dawn</i>

800
00:41:28.066 --> 00:41:30.200
<i>What we have learned is a drop</i>

801
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.466
<i>What we must learn is an ocean</i>

802
00:41:32.533 --> 00:41:34.466
<i>Marks are like a jail</i>

803
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.600
<i>But knowledge is your freedom</i>

804
00:41:36.666 --> 00:41:37.766
<i>Read now. study now</i>

805
00:41:38.033 --> 00:41:40.200
<i>Study everything</i>
<i>Other things are unnecessary</i>

806

How come all of your

Sir. please don’t tell anyone.

-No need.
-What happened. madam?

889
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.233
Your friend does not know
how to behave with girls.

890
00:45:43.433 --> 00:45:44.366
What did you do?

891
00:45:44.433 --> 00:45:46.533
This fleabag was harassing
my daughter.

892
00:45:46.666 --> 00:45:48.133
Oh. my God!

893
00:45:48.433 --> 00:45:50.333
I tried something romantic.

Yuck!

895
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.700
Romantic?

896
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.233
Idiot!

897
00:45:58.233 --> 00:45:59.166
Are you drunk?

898
00:45:59.566 --> 00:46:01.500
I had a couple of drinks for courage.

899
00:46:01.666 --> 00:46:03.366
Then she. too.
smacked me a couple of times.

900
00:46:03.433 --> 00:46:04.600
You scoundrel!

901
00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.033
How many scoundrels?

902
00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.366
<i>For whom</i>

903
00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:13.066
<i>For whom is this</i>

904
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.266
There are a lot of mosquitoes.

905
00:46:14.366 --> 00:46:15.566
Please. come inside.

906
00:46:15.666 --> 00:46:18.000
I didn’t flinch when she smacked me.

907
00:46:18.233 --> 00:46:19.666
Get lost. Prakash Reddy.

908
00:46:23.333 --> 00:46:24.266
Malaria.

909

Take good care of Meenakshi.

910
00:46:30.533 --> 00:46:31.533
You take care of yourself.

911
00:46:36.366 --> 00:46:37.333
What happened. brother?

912
00:46:38.433 --> 00:46:39.366
I am leaving.

913
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.366
Brother. why are you scared of Malaria?
Nothing will happen.

914
00:46:42.433 --> 00:46:45.266
So. should I wait till I get Typhoid.
Dengue. and Chikungunya?

915
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.566
-Let me go. brother.
-Brother. nothing like that would happen.

916
00:46:47.633 --> 00:46:49.300
Yeah. even my gym coach
said the same thing.

917
00:46:49.366 --> 00:46:51.300
Nothing will happen if you
lift weights.

918
00:46:51.366 --> 00:46:53.066
I injured myself just by
lifting dumbbells.

919
00:46:53.133 --> 00:46:54.100
-Good evening. Bala sir.
-Good evening. Bala sir.

920
00:46:54.166 --> 00:46:56.100
-Good evening.
-Hey. I am also here. right?

921
00:46:56.166 --> 00:46:57.100
Will you not wish me?

922
00:46:57.166 --> 00:46:58.100
Coconut head!

923
00:46:58.166 --> 00:47:00.266
Even the students only like you.

924
00:47:00.333 --> 00:47:01.300
But me?

925
00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.666
Brother?

926
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.233
Bye. sister!

927
00:47:12.433 --> 00:47:13.633
What should we do now?

928
00:47:15.733 --> 00:47:17.166
About chemistry and physics. right?

929
00:47:18.066 --> 00:47:19.166
I will handle both classes.

930
00:47:19.566 --> 00:47:21.133
-You?
-Yes.

931
00:47:21.266 --> 00:47:23.033
Can you teach science?

932
00:47:23.166 --> 00:47:25.333
Madam. what are you saying?

933
00:47:25.766 --> 00:47:27.733
I scored full marks in my 12th.
Do you know that?

934
00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.500
English was my Achilles heel.

935
00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.066
Or else. I would
have scored 1200 for sure.

936
00:47:33.466 --> 00:47:38.233
Mr. Prakash Reddy and Mr. Karthik
are on leave due to personal reasons.

937
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.033
So. I will be taking both physics
and chemistry classes.

938
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:45.566
-Yay!
-Yay!

939
00:47:45.633 --> 00:47:47.033
Come!

940
00:47:48.166 --> 00:47:52.300
I cannot take two separate classes.
So. you need to adjust.

941
00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.100
-Hey. get up.
-Get up. man.

942
00:47:55.166 --> 00:47:56.466
-I cannot sit beside you.
-Didn't you hear me?

943
00:47:56.533 --> 00:48:01.333
So. now we are going
to be studying speed.

944
00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.333
Hey. move to that side.

945
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.400
Hey. I will break your skull.

946
00:48:03.466 --> 00:48:04.600
-Hey!
-Hey!

947
00:48:04.666 --> 00:48:06.100
-What do you think of yourself?
-Hey?

948
00:48:06.166 --> 00:48:07.566
Get lost! Go now!

949
00:48:09.533 --> 00:48:11.333
Hey. what is the problem?

950
00:48:12.233 --> 00:48:13.233
What is it?

951
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.233
First. you all sit down.

952
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.100
Sir…

953
00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.533
we will never sit beside them.

954
00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:23.633
Why?

955
00:48:25.766 --> 00:48:28.000
-Because they are…
-They are?

956
00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.166
-They are different.
-Different. how?

957
00:48:30.366 --> 00:48:31.566
Different means. different. sir.

958
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.633
That’s okay. sir. We will stand.

959
00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.500
Yes. sir.

960
00:48:37.566 --> 00:48:38.500
All of you step out.

961
00:48:39.033 --> 00:48:41.000
Sir. what did we do?

962
00:48:41.666 --> 00:48:42.566
Get out!

963
00:48:42.666 --> 00:48:43.566
Get out!

964
00:48:48.533 --> 00:48:52.566
Average speed = total distance
traveled / total time…

965
00:48:52.633 --> 00:48:54.033
-Why are you all standing out?
-taken.

966
00:48:54.366 --> 00:48:55.533
Sir asked us to.

967
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.500
Why?

968
00:48:56.566 --> 00:49:02.033
Mean average = deltaT/deltaX
= X1+X2/T1+

969
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:03.033
-T2
-Bala sir?

970
00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.400
Madam. give me five minutes. please.

971
00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:05.600
Five minutes.

972
00:49:06.166 --> 00:49:07.066
Please.

973
00:49:08.666 --> 00:49:10.200
-Are you taking notes?
-Yes. sir!

974
00:49:14.766 --> 00:49:17.200
And this is instantaneous speed.

975
00:49:19.666 --> 00:49:20.566
Did you understand?

976
00:49:20.633 --> 00:49:21.566
Yes. sir.

977
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.566
Did you understand it clearly?

978
00:49:23.633 --> 00:49:25.066
-Clearly. sir.
-Clearly. sir.

979
00:49:25.133 --> 00:49:26.133
Very good. Now get out.

980
00:49:30.033 --> 00:49:30.766
Go out.

981
00:49:36.166 --> 00:49:37.066
You all come inside.

982
00:49:42.166 --> 00:49:43.100
Velocity.

983
00:49:45.066 --> 00:49:48.400
The average velocity of all
moving objects is zero.

984
00:49:48.466 --> 00:49:49.366
Okay?

985
00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.000
Did you understand?

986
00:49:54.066 --> 00:49:55.033
Yes. sir.

987
00:49:56.766 --> 00:49:57.766
Now you all come inside.

988
00:50:00.733 --> 00:50:01.700
Now all of you get up.

989
00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:03.500
Stand up. Get up fast.

990
00:50:10.566 --> 00:50:12.233
Today I taught you two topics.

991
00:50:12.533 --> 00:50:14.733
The first was speed.
and the other one was velocity.

992
00:50:15.433 --> 00:50:16.766
Tomorrow I will conduct a test on both.

993
00:50:17.066 --> 00:50:18.166
So come prepared.

994
00:50:19.566 --> 00:50:20.466
How come. sir?

995
00:50:20.666 --> 00:50:22.400
You taught us only about speed.

996
00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:25.566
Sir. you taught us only about velocity.

997
00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.033
I covered two topics.

998
00:50:28.633 --> 00:50:29.566
The first was speed.

999
00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.166
And the second one was velocity.

1000
00:50:32.333 --> 00:50:33.700
Tomorrow there will be a test on both.

1001
00:50:34.533 --> 00:50:35.666
So come prepared.

1002
00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:38.100
This is not fair.

1003
00:50:39.233 --> 00:50:42.000
Yes. sir. You took the classes separately.
Then how can you test us on both?

1004
00:50:43.466 --> 00:50:44.600
For 60 minutes…

1005
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.266
I took separate classes

1006
00:50:47.333 --> 00:50:49.066
and you all feel that it is not fair.

1007
00:50:49.733 --> 00:50:51.100
For the past 17 years…

1008
00:50:52.133 --> 00:50:54.533
you have been living with
a wall in between in the name of caste.

1009
00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.133
Don’t you find that wrong?

1010
00:51:00.433 --> 00:51:02.500
Sir. our parents will never allow it.

1011
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.133
Fine. this is your village. Okay.

1012
00:51:07.033 --> 00:51:10.366
What if you go to a town
or a city for higher studies?

1013
00:51:11.733 --> 00:51:14.233
Will you see differences even there?

1014
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.400
Alright. If you get a good job
after your studies.

1015
00:51:19.733 --> 00:51:21.333
and if your boss is

1016
00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.100
of different a caste.
What will you do then?

1017
00:51:24.166 --> 00:51:26.633
Will you quit the job?

1018
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.700
Fine.

1019
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.500
I have been here all these days.

1020
00:51:33.166 --> 00:51:34.333
What is my caste. tell me?

1021
00:51:36.033 --> 00:51:37.066
Don’t you want to know?

1022
00:51:38.733 --> 00:51:41.766
Because… I am imparting knowledge.

1023
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.600
And you need me.

1024
00:51:45.033 --> 00:51:47.033
You are not bothered about my caste.

1025
00:51:49.566 --> 00:51:51.666
Muthu wrote all your assignments.

1026
00:51:51.733 --> 00:51:54.166
Why weren’t you disturbed by his caste?

1027
00:51:55.633 --> 00:51:56.533
Why?

1028
00:51:56.733 --> 00:51:59.233
Because your needs will know no caste.

1029
00:52:00.133 --> 00:52:02.466
Likewise. no man is ever unwanted.

1030
00:52:03.666 --> 00:52:08.066
When you know that. you will forget
all these minuscule differences.

1031
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.333
We got it. sir.

1032
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.466
Please take the class for all of us.

1033
00:52:17.666 --> 00:52:18.766
Listen carefully.

1034
00:52:19.466 --> 00:52:21.266
I have covered two topics today.

1035
00:52:21.666 --> 00:52:23.433
I cannot take the class again.

1036
00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.433
Sir. please don’t say that.

1037
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.733
Veeranna. did you understand
what he taught?

1038
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.000
Yes. I did.

1039
00:52:35.133 --> 00:52:36.433
Then you teach me about velocity.

1040
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.633
I will teach you about speed.

1041
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:38.733
Okay?

1042
00:52:40.533 --> 00:52:41.566
Padmavathi?

1043
00:52:42.433 --> 00:52:43.333
Come here.

1044
00:53:11.066 --> 00:53:12.033
What is this. madam?

1045
00:53:12.166 --> 00:53:14.366
Will you not ask
for permission before entering?

1046
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.300
<i>You gave me a gift of love</i>

1047
00:53:43.366 --> 00:53:45.733
<i>You came into this wretched heart</i>

1048
00:53:46.233 --> 00:53:48.500
<i>You gave me a gift of love</i>

1049
00:53:48.566 --> 00:53:51.166
<i>You came into this wretched heart</i>

1050
00:53:51.533 --> 00:53:54.200
<i>There is no guide to teach love</i>

1051
00:53:54.266 --> 00:53:56.566
<i>So come to teach me. teacher</i>

1052
00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:59.500
<i>There are desires saved up</i>

1053
00:53:59.566 --> 00:54:02.066
<i>Come to give all that to me. teacher</i>

1054
00:54:02.133 --> 00:54:06.566
<i>I will exchange my heart for yours</i>

1055
00:54:07.666 --> 00:54:10.266
<i>Oh my! What feeling is this?</i>

1056
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.666
<i>I failed because of you</i>

1057
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:15.366
<i>I pretended not to like you</i>

1058
00:54:15.433 --> 00:54:18.133
<i>But I am all yours now</i>

1059
00:54:18.233 --> 00:54:20.666
<i>Oh my! What feeling is this?</i>

1060
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.300
<i>I failed because of you</i>

1061
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:26.033
<i>I pretended not to like you</i>

1062
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:29.066
<i>But I am all yours now</i>

1063
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.366
<i>-I became a nightingale</i>
-I am going home.

1064
00:55:13.433 --> 00:55:15.133
<i>-That sings your name every day</i>
-This is the

1065
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.633
number of the phone booth
near my house.

1066
00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:18.600
-Call me if you need anything.
<i>-Since you saw me</i>

1067
00:55:18.666 --> 00:55:21.166
<i>I have become very stylish</i>

1068
00:55:21.266 --> 00:55:26.300
<i>I became a Hero pen in your pocket</i>

1069
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:31.033
<i>With all my heart I became your fan</i>

1070
00:55:31.166 --> 00:55:33.666
<i>I want to keep looking at you</i>

1071
00:55:33.733 --> 00:55:36.200
<i>I want to join hands with you</i>

1072
00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:39.600
<i>We must go around this village</i>

1073
00:55:39.666 --> 00:55:41.433
<i>Together as lovers</i>

1074
00:55:41.533 --> 00:55:46.700
<i>A grand marriage with band concert</i>

1075
00:55:47.033 --> 00:55:53.233
<i>It should be heard everywhere</i>

1076
00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:56.233
This is my horoscope.

1077
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.166
Speak with your mother
and let me know.

1078
00:55:59.266 --> 00:56:00.733
<i>I pretended not to like you</i>

1079
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.300
<i>But I am all yours now</i>

1080
00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.133
<i>Oh my! What feeling is this?</i>

1081
00:56:06.366 --> 00:56:08.666
<i>I failed because of you</i>

1082
00:56:14.733 --> 00:56:15.666
Ready?

1083
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:16.733
Smile!

1084
00:56:19.533 --> 00:56:20.433
The results are out.

1085
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:21.400
Come on.

1086
00:56:23.366 --> 00:56:24.466
-Look. it is there.
-I have passed.

1087
00:56:24.533 --> 00:56:26.300
-Yes. I too passed.
-Hey. you too have passed.

1088
00:56:26.366 --> 00:56:27.766
-Hey you too have passed.
-Yeah!

1089
00:56:29.033 --> 00:56:30.733
Bala sir passed his first exam.

1090
00:56:32.033 --> 00:56:34.133
All the students secured first class
in their results.

1091
00:56:34.733 --> 00:56:37.100
The entire college was in a festive mood.

1092
00:56:37.566 --> 00:56:38.766
Look over there.

1093
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.600
-Hi!
-Hi!

1094
00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.500
Teacher. you did it!

1095
00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:56.400
Sir!

1096
00:56:56.666 --> 00:56:58.500
Where is Meen… Meenakshi madam?

1097
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.366
-Bala sir?
-Madam.

1098
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.500
Sir!

1099
00:57:05.666 --> 00:57:06.633
Sir. just a minute.

1100
00:57:07.166 --> 00:57:08.400
-Brother-in-law?
-Welcome. sir.

1101
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.466
Come. sir.
How are you. sir?

1102
00:57:11.666 --> 00:57:13.033
It’s been a long time.

1103
00:57:14.433 --> 00:57:16.200
-Balamurugan?
-Sir. it’s me!

1104
00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:17.200
-Balamurugan
-He's your guy.

1105
00:57:17.266 --> 00:57:19.766
So. I took care of everything.

1106
00:57:20.166 --> 00:57:21.333
Sir. do you remember me?

1107
00:57:21.466 --> 00:57:23.433
-That day in assembly?
-Yeah.

1108
00:57:24.066 --> 00:57:25.000
That was you?

1109
00:57:25.066 --> 00:57:26.433
Yes. sir. It was me. Balamurugan.

1110
00:57:27.066 --> 00:57:28.400
Come on brother-in-law.
Let’s cut the cake.

1111
00:57:28.466 --> 00:57:30.333
-Sir. this way. please.
-Come on.

1112
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.300
Magalakshmi.

1113
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.366
-Brother-in-law. cut the cake.
-Madam. come here.

1114
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.400
That is…

1115
00:57:39.466 --> 00:57:41.200
-Brother-in-law. feed the cake to me.
-Sir?

1116
00:57:45.366 --> 00:57:46.466
Sir. me too.

1117
00:57:51.166 --> 00:57:53.600
Sir. I did what you asked.

1118
00:57:54.166 --> 00:57:55.500
Actually. I have done much more.

1119
00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.400
All the students have secured first class.

1120
00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:59.033
Not just in maths. sir.

1121
00:57:59.266 --> 00:58:01.066
I even took physics
and chemistry classes.

1122
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.266
Biology was handled by Meenakshi madam.

1123
00:58:03.566 --> 00:58:04.566
You met her. right?

1124
00:58:05.766 --> 00:58:06.666
Good.

1125
00:58:06.733 --> 00:58:08.466
Sir. please do encourage us like this.

1126
00:58:08.533 --> 00:58:11.700
Next year. I will make the students
pass with a distinction.

1127
00:58:11.766 --> 00:58:12.666
Hey!

1128
00:58:15.066 --> 00:58:18.733
It was sheer luck
that the kids passed this year.

1129
00:58:19.566 --> 00:58:21.300
So don't get carried away!

1130
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.766
Distinction? My foot!

1131
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.500
Sir… what did I do?

1132
00:58:32.066 --> 00:58:34.200
I think you might
shut down all my schools.

1133
00:58:34.766 --> 00:58:36.566
The pass percentage in my school is 75.

1134
00:58:37.333 --> 00:58:39.266
But in this Government school.
the pass percentage is 100.

1135
00:58:39.766 --> 00:58:42.333
Now. these parents
want to admit their kids here.

1136
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:45.233
Bloody middle-class customers.

1137
00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.666
Customers?

1138
00:58:49.166 --> 00:58:50.766
-Stu…
-Customers only.

1139
00:58:52.066 --> 00:58:53.233
They are customers.

1140
00:58:55.533 --> 00:58:56.633
This is a business.

1141
00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.766
Like in any business.

1142
00:58:59.033 --> 00:59:00.733
our target is middle-class customers.

1143
00:59:03.033 --> 00:59:06.166
We have kept their minds
tuned all these days.

1144
00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:08.233
and now you're trying to change it.

1145
00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.266
What are you saying?

1146
00:59:10.466 --> 00:59:13.133
If they need a good education.
then they must pay for it.

1147
00:59:14.166 --> 00:59:16.433
Why do we have the Thirupathi logo here?

1148
00:59:17.133 --> 00:59:18.600
Because Thirupathi has more money.

1149
00:59:20.166 --> 00:59:21.600
Zero fees. zero education.

1150
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.200
More fees. more education.

1151
00:59:23.266 --> 00:59:24.500
This is the trend now.

1152
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:28.300
TNPCEE coaching is 25.000 rupees.

1153
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.600
IIT coaching is 45.000 rupees.

1154
00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.033
This is the range.

1155
00:59:33.033 --> 00:59:37.133
Anyone who wants to study has to pay.
Because only money can buy you knowledge.

1156
00:59:37.733 --> 00:59:39.500
What about the people who have nothing?

1157
00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:42.500
That is why government schools exist.

1158
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.033
Listen. they don’t have great ambitions.

1159
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:49.066
Writing a 12th standard exam
is a big thing for them.

1160
00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.533
If they pass.
they will celebrate it like a festival.

1161
00:59:53.166 --> 00:59:57.600
If he is a villager. then he will
go to work in farms and fields.

1162
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.033
If he is in a city.

1163
00:59:59.266 --> 01:00:01.300
he will settle as a driver or a cook.

1164
01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:04.600
Bloody lower middle-class.

1165
01:00:08.133 --> 01:00:09.566
Even my father is a driver. sir.

1166
01:00:10.633 --> 01:00:12.533
My family is also lower middle-class.

1167
01:00:15.566 --> 01:00:21.166
I mean… I wasn't talking about you.

1168
01:00:21.633 --> 01:00:25.400
Didn’t you take over these schools
to help them?

1169
01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.166
Was it just business?

1170
01:00:28.466 --> 01:00:30.766
You have mistaken me.

1171
01:00:32.233 --> 01:00:33.233
I wasn't talking about you.

1172
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.033
Sir. you didn’t send me here
to achieve anything.

1173
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.333
You thought I'll fail here.

1174
01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.000
Hey…

1175
01:00:42.066 --> 01:00:45.200
Bala. it was a slip of the tongue.

1176
01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:47.000
Let it go. Okay?

1177
01:00:49.366 --> 01:00:50.533
You are talented.

1178
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.666
This is not the place for you.

1179
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.100
Come with me.

1180
01:00:54.666 --> 01:00:58.300
I will make you
a permanent teacher in the main branch.

1181
01:00:59.166 --> 01:01:01.133
I will pay you one lakh rupees per month.

1182
01:01:01.733 --> 01:01:03.566
I will give you a house.
a car. and everything.

1183
01:01:04.033 --> 01:01:05.166
Come with me.

1184
01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.533
Sir. the food is ready.

1185
01:01:14.233 --> 01:01:16.066
Come. let’s eat and leave.

1186
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600
Come.

1187
01:01:28.033 --> 01:01:30.333
Brother. can you sit there and eat?

1188
01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.500
-Please don’t mind me.
-That’s okay.

1189
01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.433
Sir. they are lower middle class.

1190
01:01:37.733 --> 01:01:39.333
This is how they are.

1191
01:01:39.566 --> 01:01:40.466
You eat. sir.

1192
01:01:40.733 --> 01:01:41.633
Please eat.

1193
01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.300
Generally.
parents from the lower middle class

1194
01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:50.333
neglect their needs
to fulfill the needs of their kids.

1195
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.400
They would starve themselves
so that their kids could eat.

1196
01:02:02.333 --> 01:02:04.200
They would buy new clothes for their kids

1197
01:02:04.433 --> 01:02:06.600
and continue
to stitch their tattered clothing.

1198
01:02:10.466 --> 01:02:12.400
These same parents
would even sell their blood

1199
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:17.666
so that their kids
could go to a good school.

1200
01:02:18.233 --> 01:02:19.733
But how long will you keep doing this?

1201
01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.066
I have made up my mind.

1202
01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.300
I think their future is better than
your offer.

1203
01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:37.633
I think it is fair for me
to stay here than to come with you.

1204
01:02:37.733 --> 01:02:39.066
What can you do?

1205
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.066
You can help them pass another year.

1206
01:02:42.533 --> 01:02:45.000
Will that change their lives?

1207
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.300
Sir. not just pass.
I will make them state toppers.

1208
01:02:48.633 --> 01:02:49.766
Sure. And then?

1209
01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:56.633
Here there are…
10. 17. 25. 30. 45 students.

1210
01:02:56.733 --> 01:02:59.466
I will help all these students
to secure a state rank.

1211
01:03:04.066 --> 01:03:05.233
I will never let you win.

1212
01:03:13.733 --> 01:03:18.433
Sir. education is like an offering
to God in the temple. Be generous.

1213
01:03:19.133 --> 01:03:21.666
Don’t sell it like
the food in five-star hotels.

1214
01:03:29.333 --> 01:03:30.333
Thirupathi sir!

1215
01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:34.066
Thank you. sir.

1216
01:03:34.633 --> 01:03:35.533
Take care. sir.

1217
01:03:36.566 --> 01:03:37.466
Bye. sir.

1218
01:03:38.633 --> 01:03:39.533
Brother-in-law!

1219
01:03:39.666 --> 01:03:42.666
Brother-in-law. just a minute.

1220
01:03:43.133 --> 01:03:44.033
Give that.

1221
01:03:46.366 --> 01:03:48.000
-Go on.
-Sir. please smile.

1222
01:03:49.433 --> 01:03:50.466
Get lost!

1223
01:03:53.266 --> 01:03:54.200
Brother-in-law?

1224
01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.633
Brother-in-law?

1225
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:14.766
GOVERNMENT HIGHER SECONDARY SCHOOL
CHOLAVARAM

1226
01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.400
Thirupathi. you said.
“Use your brain. Sudhakar!”

1227
01:04:22.666 --> 01:04:25.266
You said only third-grade
junior teachers would be sent.

1228
01:04:25.733 --> 01:04:29.433
Now because of this one guy you
sent. we are going to lose everything.

1229
01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:30.633
He is just one man. right?

1230
01:04:31.066 --> 01:04:32.266
What if it doesn’t stop with just him?

1231
01:04:32.566 --> 01:04:35.466
What if other teachers
get inspired by him?

1232
01:04:35.533 --> 01:04:36.566
What will we do then?

1233
01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.000
A MIRACLE IN SOZHAVARAM

1234
01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:42.500
What if this article
comes on the first page?

1235
01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.366
People will surely neglect our ads.

1236
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Hey…

1237
01:04:47.433 --> 01:04:52.166
I started this business with
teachers who had no idea about life.

1238
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.533
I built this empire.

1239
01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.233
I will not keep quiet
if someone tries to destroy it.

1240
01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:05.300
After all. he is a school teacher.
Why don’t you fire him?

1241
01:05:07.066 --> 01:05:08.566
There are some issues
in the contract. Sena.

1242
01:05:08.666 --> 01:05:09.566
What are they?

1243
01:05:09.733 --> 01:05:11.700
A notice must be issued
six months in advance.

1244
01:05:12.266 --> 01:05:14.600
But giving him so much time
will surely create problems for me.

1245
01:05:15.066 --> 01:05:15.766
So what?

1246
01:05:16.266 --> 01:05:17.633
Do you want
to put the government at risk?

1247
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.000
The opposition party
will have a field day with this.

1248
01:05:20.233 --> 01:05:21.400
CM will never consent to this.

1249
01:05:33.733 --> 01:05:35.266
Hey. Thirupathi?

1250
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.066
Why is another Benz car here?

1251
01:05:38.466 --> 01:05:39.533
That is not mine.

1252
01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:41.000
It is yours.

1253
01:05:44.166 --> 01:05:45.666
All this is fine with me.

1254
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.333
But CM will never agree to it.

1255
01:05:53.433 --> 01:05:55.566
Why is Narayanasamy here?

1256
01:05:55.633 --> 01:05:57.433
CM may not listen to you.

1257
01:05:57.533 --> 01:06:00.066
But he has to listen
to the opposition leader in the assembly.

1258
01:06:01.466 --> 01:06:02.366
Thirupathi?

1259
01:06:02.466 --> 01:06:04.100
-Can you do me a small favor?
-What is it?

1260
01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.033
Please don’t come into politics.

1261
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.566
I definitely will not.

1262
01:06:08.433 --> 01:06:10.466
You can never earn like this in politics.

1263
01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.300
GOVERNMENT OF TAMIL NADU CHIEF SECRETARIAT

1264
01:06:13.366 --> 01:06:17.600
Honorable Speaker.
the rate of unemployment

1265
01:06:17.666 --> 01:06:20.566
in our state is on a continuous rise.
What is the reason?

1266
01:06:22.166 --> 01:06:24.100
A PROTEST STARTED BY NARAYANASAMY

1267
01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.633
<i>Privatization!</i>

1268
01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:30.233
<i>Like roads and railway contracts.</i>
<i>the government has handed over</i>

1269
01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.600
<i>education to private organizations.</i>

1270
01:06:32.766 --> 01:06:35.233
President has ordered us not
to supply milk to you.

1271
01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:37.633
If you want it. please come
to the center to buy milk.

1272
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:38.700
Sorry. sir!

1273
01:06:41.133 --> 01:06:46.166
What are you going to tell the youth
who have registered

1274
01:06:46.233 --> 01:06:50.266
with the employment exchange?
And are waiting for teaching job offers?

1275
01:06:50.533 --> 01:06:54.066
<i>I insist you cancel this government order</i>

1276
01:06:54.166 --> 01:06:57.500
<i>that allows the privatization of schools.</i>

1277
01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.633
<i>-Education Minister!</i>
<i>-Down. down!</i>

1278
01:07:09.366 --> 01:07:11.133
Give the key to madam.

1279
01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.033
You are fired.

1280
01:07:13.533 --> 01:07:14.433
What happened. sir?

1281
01:07:14.666 --> 01:07:15.633
Go and ask your son.

1282
01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:17.366
Sir?

1283
01:07:25.266 --> 01:07:28.666
<i>Last year appointment of teachers</i>
<i>to government schools was delayed</i>

1284
01:07:28.733 --> 01:07:31.300
<i>due to the negligence of some officers.</i>

1285
01:07:31.366 --> 01:07:35.033
<i>The Private Schools Association took over</i>
<i>some government schools and helped us out.</i>

1286
01:07:35.466 --> 01:07:37.000
<i>But situations have changed</i>
<i>for the better.</i>

1287
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.533
<i>In the recently conducted interviews.</i>
<i>we have selected 500 teachers.</i>

1288
01:07:44.366 --> 01:07:47.133
<i>But we cannot appoint them immediately.</i>

1289
01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.366
<i>Because all the government schools</i>
<i>are under contract with private schools.</i>

1290
01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:53.366
<i>So their teachers are still working there.</i>

1291
01:07:53.566 --> 01:07:56.233
<i>Hence we couldn’t appoint anyone.</i>

1292
01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.200
<i>So. we are immediately canceling the MOU.</i>

1293
01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.566
<i>thus revoking the government order</i>
<i>that was passed earlier.</i>

1294
01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:06.266
<i>After this. all the private teachers</i>
<i>will return to their schools.</i>

1295
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.000
Son. don’t worry.
Everything will be alright.

1296
01:08:12.366 --> 01:08:15.100
I made a vow to visit Kasi
if Meenakshi found a good match.

1297
01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:17.100
That is why we are in a hurry.

1298
01:08:23.366 --> 01:08:24.266
Muthu?

1299
01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.000
Muthu?

1300
01:08:28.666 --> 01:08:31.166
Brother. did you see Muthu?

1301
01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:32.566
He is at the liquor shop.

1302
01:08:53.333 --> 01:08:54.266
Wipe it.

1303
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.700
12th standard supplementary
exam hall ticket.

1304
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.433
Remember?

1305
01:09:07.233 --> 01:09:09.100
You promised
to do whatever I ask for.

1306
01:09:28.633 --> 01:09:30.333
My mother and father are gone.

1307
01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.133
Now you are leaving too.

1308
01:09:33.266 --> 01:09:34.466
Then for whom should I write?

1309
01:09:51.233 --> 01:09:53.133
You wanted to study engineering.

1310
01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.333
But I couldn’t afford that.

1311
01:09:57.166 --> 01:09:58.133
I am a loser.

1312
01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.266
-Why do you say…
-Hey!

1313
01:09:59.366 --> 01:10:02.400
Just ensure at least one of the students
studies engineering or medicine.

1314
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.600
I will consider myself a winner.

1315
01:10:05.666 --> 01:10:10.066
Behind the happiness
of that student’s parents.

1316
01:10:10.166 --> 01:10:13.000
I will feel proud
that my son did all this.

1317
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.500
Yes.

1318
01:10:18.066 --> 01:10:18.766
What happened?

1319
01:10:19.133 --> 01:10:20.400
Why are you lamenting over this?

1320
01:10:22.233 --> 01:10:27.166
When they don't get what they desire.
Kids will cry only for a day.

1321
01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:31.200
But their parents will cry throughout
their lives when they couldn’t

1322
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.700
afford their child’s needs.

1323
01:10:34.633 --> 01:10:36.033
You will never understand that pain.

1324
01:10:52.433 --> 01:10:53.766
They thought that they won.

1325
01:10:56.366 --> 01:10:58.366
But the war had just begun.

1326
01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.000
So many gave their names
to join the 11th standard.

1327
01:11:03.166 --> 01:11:04.233
But now. they've disappeared.

1328
01:11:07.233 --> 01:11:08.400
-Hey. Veeranna?
-Yes?

1329
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.700
-Where are you going with a bag?
-I am going to the class.

1330
01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:12.033
Class?

1331
01:11:12.533 --> 01:11:14.433
We have at least three months
before the teachers arrive.

1332
01:11:14.533 --> 01:11:16.733
-What?
-Even the holidays are not over. Come!

1333
01:11:56.633 --> 01:11:57.533
Hello?

1334
01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:00.233
Brother-in-law.
that maths teacher is still here.

1335
01:12:00.766 --> 01:12:02.366
He is taking classes outside
the village.

1336
01:12:03.566 --> 01:12:05.266
-What happened. sir?
-Get lost!

1337
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.766
<i>-What should we do?</i>
-You blithering fool!

1338
01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.000
He is taking a class in your village.

1339
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.166
Aren’t you the president?
And you're asking me?

1340
01:12:14.033 --> 01:12:16.000
Hey. find out who owns the land.

1341
01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:28.066
-This school is cool. isn’t it?
-Yes. buddy.

1342
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:32.000
Hey. teacher! How are you?

1343
01:12:35.666 --> 01:12:36.666
How dare you?!

1344
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.366
Take everything apart!

1345
01:12:38.433 --> 01:12:39.766
Hey. don’t do that!

1346
01:12:41.133 --> 01:12:42.266
Hey!

1347
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.566
Hey. listen to me. Let go of me.

1348
01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.533
Pull everything down!

1349
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.000
Hey! Get up!

1350
01:13:47.066 --> 01:13:47.766
I said. get up!

1351
01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:55.666
Didn't you hear me?

1352
01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:58.266
You idiot!

1353
01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:22.366
-Sir. he is beating me!
-Hey. wait! Stop there!

1354
01:15:22.433 --> 01:15:24.400
Are you trying to create trouble?
Come to the station.

1355
01:15:24.466 --> 01:15:27.566
Sir. they were the ones who destroyed
everything when the kids were studying.

1356
01:15:28.333 --> 01:15:29.566
I know what happened here.

1357
01:15:29.633 --> 01:15:31.266
-Now come to the station.
-Just leave me. sir.

1358
01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:36.000
Now. I know.

1359
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.533
You guys are all the same.

1360
01:15:40.566 --> 01:15:43.466
What are you mumbling there? Speak up.

1361
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:46.733
How much did you get?

1362
01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.500
What?

1363
01:15:50.033 --> 01:15:51.200
How much was your price?

1364
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:52.700
What did you say?

1365
01:15:52.766 --> 01:15:53.733
Hey. give that to me!

1366
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.066
For how much did you sell
your loyalty?

1367
01:15:56.433 --> 01:15:58.533
Do you know
to whom you are talking?

1368
01:15:59.566 --> 01:16:01.300
-Sir!
-How much money did you receive?

1369
01:16:01.366 --> 01:16:02.366
How much did they pay you?

1370
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.366
How dare you touch a Policeman!

1371
01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.400
Rascal!

1372
01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:09.333
Come here!

1373
01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:11.766
Drive!

1374
01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:17.266
-Hey. sir!
-Police are taking him away.

1375
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.233
-They are taking him!
-Sir!

1376
01:16:19.566 --> 01:16:21.000
-Sir!
-They're taking him.

1377
01:16:30.533 --> 01:16:31.633
Beat him up.

1378
01:16:34.366 --> 01:16:36.666
Sir. it is not right to beat a teacher.

1379
01:16:36.733 --> 01:16:38.566
How dare he hit me?
Do you want me to spare him?

1380
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.033
Hey! Thrash that fellow to death.

1381
01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.566
Sir!

1382
01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:44.533
Let our sir out!

1383
01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:45.500
Let him go!

1384
01:16:45.566 --> 01:16:46.466
Sir!

1385
01:16:47.033 --> 01:16:47.733
Sir!

1386
01:16:48.133 --> 01:16:49.033
Sir!

1387
01:16:51.133 --> 01:16:53.500
Mr. President!
Police have arrested our Bala sir.

1388
01:16:53.566 --> 01:16:55.600
-If you could…
-Our Bala sir?

1389
01:16:56.033 --> 01:16:56.733
What. sir?

1390
01:16:57.133 --> 01:16:58.533
You’ve become very close to him.

1391
01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.500
No. sir. But…

1392
01:17:00.066 --> 01:17:02.200
Do you think the police
arrested him for no reason?

1393
01:17:02.366 --> 01:17:04.400
He illegally occupied Subbaiah’s land.

1394
01:17:04.466 --> 01:17:06.266
He filed a complaint.
Hence. they arrested him.

1395
01:17:06.333 --> 01:17:07.233
No way. sir.

1396
01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:10.633
He asked Subbaiah’s permission
to take his class there.

1397
01:17:10.766 --> 01:17:12.300
-Tell him.
-Yes. tell me!

1398
01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.400
Phone call for you.

1399
01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.600
-Who is it?
-Inspector.

1400
01:17:16.533 --> 01:17:17.433
Hello?

1401
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.733
Sir. the students are rioting
in front of the station.

1402
01:17:21.033 --> 01:17:22.133
Just give them a good beating.

1403
01:17:22.233 --> 01:17:23.200
They will automatically disperse.

1404
01:17:23.266 --> 01:17:25.366
-Your daughter is also among them.
-What?

1405
01:17:26.766 --> 01:17:29.000
-Leave me.
-Move away!

1406
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.366
CHOLAVARAM POLICE STATION

1407
01:17:32.233 --> 01:17:33.366
Stop it.

1408
01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.300
I will kill you!

1409
01:17:38.266 --> 01:17:39.166
Stop it!

1410
01:17:39.233 --> 01:17:40.366
-Stop it!
-Why should we?

1411
01:17:40.433 --> 01:17:41.633
Ask them to release our sir.

1412
01:17:41.766 --> 01:17:43.100
You all are behaving like goons.

1413
01:17:43.166 --> 01:17:45.533
-Let me go!
-Shut up and go home with your parents.

1414
01:17:46.066 --> 01:17:47.600
-Hey!
-Come on. Let’s go!

1415
01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.700
What are you doing?
Won’t you listen to me?

1416
01:17:49.766 --> 01:17:50.733
-But Dad. it is our sir!
-Our sir is in jail mom.

1417
01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:52.466
She is your daughter. right?
Take her home now.

1418
01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.500
Come on.

1419
01:17:53.733 --> 01:17:54.733
Our sir!

1420
01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:56.000
Dad!

1421
01:17:56.733 --> 01:17:58.133
-Our sir is in there!
-Take them.

1422
01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:12.333
Hey. don’t put him in jail
and make him a martyr.

1423
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.333
He has to flee that village.

1424
01:18:15.466 --> 01:18:16.500
Like an orphan.

1425
01:18:18.733 --> 01:18:22.266
For misusing the school funds.

1426
01:18:22.633 --> 01:18:26.400
For trying to occupy Subbaiah’s land.

1427
01:18:26.666 --> 01:18:30.733
And for manhandling the
Panchayat members. government employees.

1428
01:18:31.066 --> 01:18:35.233
and local body members.
For all these reasons.

1429
01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:41.400
Balamurugan is being expelled
from our village!

1430
01:18:48.133 --> 01:18:49.400
Mr. President. did you call me?

1431
01:18:50.466 --> 01:18:53.100
My slipper is torn. Mend it fast.

1432
01:18:58.033 --> 01:18:58.733
Yes. come.

1433
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.666
Does your daughter
think she is a goon?

1434
01:19:01.233 --> 01:19:02.766
She threw stones
at the police station!

1435
01:19:03.433 --> 01:19:05.666
-But. our teacher…
-Not a word. or else I will kill you!

1436
01:19:26.366 --> 01:19:27.266
Who is it?

1437
01:19:27.333 --> 01:19:30.000
I think the police have come
to drop that teacher.

1438
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.433
Go and see what it is.

1439
01:19:32.066 --> 01:19:32.766
Okay. sir.

1440
01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.633
Sir. please!

1441
01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:56.300
We must not help him.

1442
01:20:29.733 --> 01:20:31.233
Hey. where are you going?

1443
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:34.766
-Hey. stop!
-Hey!

1444
01:20:36.433 --> 01:20:38.233
No. don't come.

1445
01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:40.000
Muthu. no!

1446
01:20:40.133 --> 01:20:41.033
Get back.

1447
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.333
-Hey. leave me!
-Go now!

1448
01:22:44.633 --> 01:22:45.533
Hey!

1449
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.500
-Come here!
-Leave me!

1450
01:22:48.633 --> 01:22:49.533
Leave me!

1451
01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.733
Hey!

1452
01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:54.366
He was the man who taught us.

1453
01:22:54.433 --> 01:22:55.400
Can you tell him…

1454
01:22:56.466 --> 01:22:57.700
He did all this for you.

1455
01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.300
His feet are burning
in the scorching heat.

1456
01:23:01.133 --> 01:23:02.633
But you're sitting
in the comfort of your house?

1457
01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:05.666
Are you a human being?

1458
01:23:06.266 --> 01:23:07.266
You ungrateful hounds!

1459
01:23:10.233 --> 01:23:12.100
Leave me! Let me go!

1460
01:23:21.066 --> 01:23:22.000
What?

1461
01:23:27.666 --> 01:23:28.566
Hey!

1462
01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.300
-Sir!
-Veeranna!

1463
01:23:49.033 --> 01:23:49.733
Hey. Ranga!

1464
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:51.600
Hey. Chellaiya!

1465
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.766
What is your son up to?

1466
01:23:55.033 --> 01:23:56.600
Hey. Veeranna!

1467
01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.433
What are you doing?

1468
01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:01.366
President will expel us
from the village.

1469
01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:02.533
What do you mean?

1470
01:24:03.466 --> 01:24:05.300
We are already living on
the outskirts.

1471
01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.666
Let's go out of this village.

1472
01:24:07.266 --> 01:24:08.766
What difference will that make?

1473
01:24:13.766 --> 01:24:16.033
I was never allowed
to see God in the temple's sanctum.

1474
01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:18.533
I saw him only at school.

1475
01:24:19.633 --> 01:24:21.266
He is our God!

1476
01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.100
<i>Tears are welling up</i>

1477
01:25:08.166 --> 01:25:10.766
<i>Tears are welling up in eyes</i>

1478
01:25:11.566 --> 01:25:17.166
<i>The heart is crumbling</i>

1479
01:25:17.566 --> 01:25:19.133
<i>From all the anguish</i>

1480
01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.533
<i>The golden pot which fed us</i>

1481
01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.366
<i>Now it is broken</i>

1482
01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:26.600
<i>We went to worship Lord</i>

1483
01:25:26.666 --> 01:25:29.400
<i>But the temple came shattering down</i>

1484
01:25:29.566 --> 01:25:35.133
<i>The hurricane lamp has become dark</i>

1485
01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:41.233
<i>The pureness of milk has become black</i>

1486
01:25:41.533 --> 01:25:47.200
<i>The plain land is drenched with water</i>

1487
01:25:47.566 --> 01:25:52.666
<i>The flowers have drowned in the tears</i>

1488
01:25:53.533 --> 01:25:59.166
<i>As all the villagers come forward</i>

1489
01:25:59.533 --> 01:26:05.000
<i>The crescent has stopped in its tracks</i>

1490
01:26:05.633 --> 01:26:08.600
<i>Even if it grows in the backyard</i>

1491
01:26:08.666 --> 01:26:11.266
<i>The holy basil has a fragrance</i>

1492
01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.600
<i>Even when thrown in the streets</i>

1493
01:26:14.666 --> 01:26:17.600
<i>-Our love shall continue to live on</i>
-Please drop our teacher near his home.

1494
01:26:17.666 --> 01:26:20.500
<i>Like smoke in the earthen stove</i>

1495
01:26:20.566 --> 01:26:23.266
<i>A group of people are scorched</i>

1496
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.566
<i>When you try to pull out the weeds</i>

1497
01:26:26.633 --> 01:26:29.266
<i>It will trample your feet and push down</i>

1498
01:26:33.266 --> 01:26:34.333
He looks like our Bala!

1499
01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.500
Bala!

1500
01:26:37.566 --> 01:26:39.566
-Sir!
-Bala!

1501
01:26:40.766 --> 01:26:41.766
Bala!

1502
01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.300
Hello?

1503
01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.100
Bala sir. how are you?

1504
01:27:06.666 --> 01:27:08.500
I was about to call you.

1505
01:27:09.133 --> 01:27:10.166
I am coming there.

1506
01:27:11.166 --> 01:27:13.233
I cannot be here without you.

1507
01:27:13.733 --> 01:27:16.066
No. you have to stay there.

1508
01:27:16.266 --> 01:27:17.366
<i>For the students.</i>

1509
01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.266
Also. I have nothing.

1510
01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:21.700
What do you mean by nothing?

1511
01:27:23.333 --> 01:27:24.400
Let's forget everything. madam.

1512
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:26.700
Hello?

1513
01:27:27.533 --> 01:27:28.433
Hello?

1514
01:27:30.466 --> 01:27:31.366
Hello?

1515
01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.100
What happened?

1516
01:27:51.066 --> 01:27:54.033
These are the new teachers.
Sri Vani. Maths teacher…

1517
01:28:01.133 --> 01:28:04.266
<i>We were toiling in the farm fields</i>

1518
01:28:04.333 --> 01:28:06.766
<i>We didn't study anything</i>

1519
01:28:07.266 --> 01:28:10.266
<i>Daily we live in the sludge</i>

1520
01:28:10.333 --> 01:28:13.200
<i>Even Lord hasn't saved us</i>

1521
01:28:13.633 --> 01:28:16.233
<i>The education that demands money</i>

1522
01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:19.133
<i>Has become a dream to us</i>

1523
01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:24.366
<i>It is like a writing on water</i>

1524
01:28:24.433 --> 01:28:25.400
GOVERNMENT HIGH SCHOOL
SOZHAVARAM

1525
01:28:25.666 --> 01:28:28.600
<i>Do we have to stitch the shirt</i>

1526
01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:31.166
<i>With a broken needle?</i>

1527
01:28:31.633 --> 01:28:34.600
<i>Do we have to bend down and slough</i>

1528
01:28:34.666 --> 01:28:36.766
<i>Our entire lives?</i>

1529
01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:40.300
<i>We have no hope for the future</i>

1530
01:28:40.666 --> 01:28:43.433
<i>But do we have to die for that?</i>

1531
01:28:43.633 --> 01:28:48.466
<i>The plain land is drenched with water</i>

1532
01:28:49.633 --> 01:28:55.200
<i>The flowers have drowned in the tears</i>

1533
01:28:55.633 --> 01:29:00.233
<i>As all the villagers come forward</i>

1534
01:29:01.633 --> 01:29:07.166
<i>The crescent has stopped in its tracks</i>

1535
01:29:12.033 --> 01:29:14.433
-We should go there today.
-Okay. fine.

1536
01:29:15.166 --> 01:29:16.300
What is this Bala?

1537
01:29:16.733 --> 01:29:18.633
What to do?
Something must be done.

1538
01:29:20.066 --> 01:29:22.500
Hence proved. you understand?

1539
01:29:24.333 --> 01:29:27.466
Write down. <i>E=MC²</i>

1540
01:29:27.566 --> 01:29:30.266
Who is that genius.
coming late to class?

1541
01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:33.533
Madam!

1542
01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.133
ANNAI ILLAM

1543
01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.300
How are you. madam?

1544
01:29:40.633 --> 01:29:41.700
How is your mother. madam?

1545
01:29:43.366 --> 01:29:44.566
I said I would come to you. right?

1546
01:29:45.333 --> 01:29:46.766
Why did you hang up abruptly?

1547
01:29:48.133 --> 01:29:49.066
It's all my fault.

1548
01:29:49.666 --> 01:29:51.700
I trusted a city boy.

1549
01:29:52.133 --> 01:29:53.266
I deserve this.

1550
01:29:55.233 --> 01:29:57.066
Madam. please don't cry.
Everyone is watching.

1551
01:29:58.033 --> 01:29:59.100
-Please. madam.
-Who is it. Bala?

1552
01:29:59.166 --> 01:30:00.066
Mom!

1553
01:30:00.133 --> 01:30:01.533
Oh. salesgirl?

1554
01:30:03.633 --> 01:30:06.166
-These people are relentless.
-Mom?

1555
01:30:06.266 --> 01:30:08.700
Always ready to sell soaps
or washing powders.

1556
01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:11.166
Listen.
no matter how much you cry.

1557
01:30:11.233 --> 01:30:13.300
-Mom. please listen to…
-we will not buy any soap or detergent.

1558
01:30:13.366 --> 01:30:15.400
Your son promised to marry me
and deceived me.

1559
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.366
Oh! No. Mom!

1560
01:30:18.266 --> 01:30:20.233
Oh. my God!
What is all this Bala?

1561
01:30:20.333 --> 01:30:23.533
-Oh. my God!
-Dear. show me your face.

1562
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.166
How can you say no
to such a pretty girl?

1563
01:30:28.433 --> 01:30:29.366
Have you gone mad?!

1564
01:30:29.433 --> 01:30:31.200
-You crazy lunatic!
-No. mom!

1565
01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.633
Don't be the cause
of a girl's tears.

1566
01:30:33.733 --> 01:30:35.700
It will never let you live in peace.

1567
01:30:36.533 --> 01:30:37.733
Hey. the class is over. Come tomorrow.

1568
01:30:38.133 --> 01:30:40.733
-It is okay. sir. We will stay.
-You'll stay?

1569
01:30:41.133 --> 01:30:43.100
What is it. dear?
What happened?

1570
01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:46.000
Your disciple had promised
to marry this pretty girl

1571
01:30:46.066 --> 01:30:48.500
but then deceived her.
and now she is pregnant.

1572
01:30:49.066 --> 01:30:50.633
Pregnant? No. mom!

1573
01:30:53.066 --> 01:30:54.500
-He didn’t get you pregnant?
-No. mom!

1574
01:30:55.366 --> 01:30:56.766
Oh! Thank God.

1575
01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:01.666
Listen. if you don't marry this girl.
I swear I will drink poison and die.

1576
01:31:01.733 --> 01:31:02.633
Can you calm down?

1577
01:31:03.066 --> 01:31:04.133
Stop talking unnecessarily.

1578
01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:05.533
What will happen after marriage?

1579
01:31:05.766 --> 01:31:06.666
How will we survive?

1580
01:31:07.033 --> 01:31:08.133
Where will she live in this house?

1581
01:31:08.566 --> 01:31:10.633
I just earn half
of what your husband earns.

1582
01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:12.533
I will work as well. sir.

1583
01:31:14.066 --> 01:31:16.666
If need be. I will take tuition here.

1584
01:31:17.433 --> 01:31:19.633
Who will come for biology tuitions. madam?

1585
01:31:22.533 --> 01:31:24.033
-Don't underestimate me.
-No!

1586
01:31:24.233 --> 01:31:25.133
-Understood?
-Yes.

1587
01:31:27.666 --> 01:31:29.733
Sharadha. serve me some food.

1588
01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:36.266
Why is your face glowing?

1589
01:31:36.633 --> 01:31:37.533
Is it?

1590
01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:39.400
Hey?

1591
01:31:41.166 --> 01:31:42.066
What happened?

1592
01:31:44.133 --> 01:31:45.133
Whatever!

1593
01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:46.666
What happened to him?

1594
01:31:47.033 --> 01:31:48.000
Uncle. he is feeling shy.

1595
01:31:48.366 --> 01:31:50.000
Oh. shy…

1596
01:31:50.166 --> 01:31:51.300
Hey. who are you?

1597
01:31:51.533 --> 01:31:53.366
Sharadha. where did you go now?

1598
01:31:54.566 --> 01:31:57.400
She is our future daughter-in-law.

1599
01:31:57.466 --> 01:31:58.366
Daughter-in-law?

1600
01:31:58.433 --> 01:32:01.066
She works as a biology teacher.
at Sozhavaram government school.

1601
01:32:01.133 --> 01:32:02.033
Oh?

1602
01:32:02.166 --> 01:32:03.766
They both are in love.

1603
01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:05.633
Hey. superb man!

1604
01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.366
He didn't even tell us.

1605
01:32:09.466 --> 01:32:10.633
How are the students. madam?

1606
01:32:11.533 --> 01:32:13.566
Are the new teachers teaching well?

1607
01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:15.400
Thank you.

1608
01:32:16.666 --> 01:32:18.233
The entire school is empty. sir.

1609
01:32:19.366 --> 01:32:20.766
None of the new teachers are good.

1610
01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.366
They took a long leave
and joined private schools.

1611
01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:26.266
Please do something. sir.

1612
01:32:28.066 --> 01:32:30.000
Let's talk about something else. madam.

1613
01:32:30.633 --> 01:32:31.633
Please help me. sir.

1614
01:32:31.733 --> 01:32:34.533
-Somehow…
-Please. sir. Please. ten rupees. sir.

1615
01:32:35.266 --> 01:32:39.400
I too feel that this teaching
profession is not my cup of tea.

1616
01:32:39.533 --> 01:32:40.766
Sir! Please. sir!

1617
01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:47.300
-I am going to… try for some other job.
-Thank you. sir!

1618
01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:50.000
Sir. I want to buy books.
but I have no money.

1619
01:32:50.066 --> 01:32:52.000
I am planning to stop the tuition.

1620
01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:54.700
-Is this a new method of begging?
-Oh! Not at all. sir.

1621
01:32:54.766 --> 01:32:56.633
You can ask any questions
from this book. I…

1622
01:32:56.733 --> 01:32:57.700
-Mummy!
-Hey. don't touch me.

1623
01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.300
Hey!

1624
01:33:01.366 --> 01:33:02.766
-Are you okay?
-Yeah okay. sir.

1625
01:33:03.733 --> 01:33:05.700
Sir. can I get ten rupees?

1626
01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.466
Sir. ten rupees. please?

1627
01:33:10.066 --> 01:33:13.200
My father stopped me from going to school
and asked me to work in a hotel.

1628
01:33:13.266 --> 01:33:14.366
Twenty rupees per day.

1629
01:33:14.433 --> 01:33:15.633
Then why do you beg?

1630
01:33:15.766 --> 01:33:19.433
Only then can I make about
30 to 40 rupees. sir.

1631
01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.133
Twenty rupees is for my father.

1632
01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:22.566
And the other twenty are for my studies.

1633
01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:24.266
Fine. I can do one thing.

1634
01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:26.300
I will give you 20 rupees.

1635
01:33:27.166 --> 01:33:28.600
You go and give it to your father.

1636
01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.633
And you can come here to study.

1637
01:33:32.066 --> 01:33:33.166
A befitting guru for the disciple.

1638
01:33:33.533 --> 01:33:35.333
Sir. are you joking?

1639
01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.766
I am very serious.

1640
01:33:44.666 --> 01:33:46.766
Tell me. will you study or not?

1641
01:33:47.033 --> 01:33:47.733
I will. sir.

1642
01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:49.000
I will study. sir.

1643
01:33:49.066 --> 01:33:51.433
First. I will go and tell my mom.

1644
01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:06.266
Bye. sir.

1645
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.533
This is what I like about you. sir.

1646
01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.633
You want all the kids
to get an education.

1647
01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:19.666
What about our students?

1648
01:34:21.466 --> 01:34:23.200
Are you going to abandon them?

1649
01:34:35.366 --> 01:34:37.233
-Sir?
-I cannot. madam.

1650
01:34:38.266 --> 01:34:39.166
I have failed.

1651
01:34:40.133 --> 01:34:42.600
Sir. if you really believe
that you've failed.

1652
01:34:42.766 --> 01:34:45.566
then it means all the 45 students
who have faith in you have failed too.

1653
01:34:45.766 --> 01:34:47.100
Even I want to succeed. madam.

1654
01:34:48.166 --> 01:34:49.200
And all of them.

1655
01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.300
Why wouldn't I?

1656
01:34:52.066 --> 01:34:52.766
But how?

1657
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.300
I… I can't even set foot in that village.

1658
01:34:58.666 --> 01:34:59.733
Sir…

1659
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.066
before you.
it was just an empty building.

1660
01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:07.733
But you turned it
into a school for students.

1661
01:35:09.566 --> 01:35:13.333
If you can do that.
then anything is possible.

1662
01:35:49.733 --> 01:35:51.000
What are you saying. madam?

1663
01:35:51.533 --> 01:35:53.366
Even if I can't go into the village.

1664
01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:56.266
it will be enough if
my teaching reaches them. right?

1665
01:35:58.433 --> 01:35:59.466
It will reach them.

1666
01:36:20.033 --> 01:36:22.100
Hello. sir! How are you?

1667
01:36:22.266 --> 01:36:24.033
I haven't seen you in a long time.

1668
01:36:24.566 --> 01:36:27.633
Sir. I heard about everything.
I felt very sad.

1669
01:36:27.733 --> 01:36:30.466
That's alright.
I need a small favor.

1670
01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:31.633
Tell me. sir.

1671
01:36:33.666 --> 01:36:34.766
Watch today!

1672
01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:39.133
A superhit film <i>Arunachalam.</i>
starring superstar Rajinikanth.

1673
01:36:39.266 --> 01:36:41.433
I'm not making enough money
from these sleazy movies.

1674
01:36:41.533 --> 01:36:45.033
So. if I show family movies.
I can make some extra money.

1675
01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:48.333
I am planning
to show a free movie on the first day.

1676
01:36:48.466 --> 01:36:50.433
Exclusively to our 12th grade students!

1677
01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.600
I request all of you
to come and see the movie.

1678
01:36:52.666 --> 01:36:55.100
Do come without fail
to our Lakshmi Talkies.

1679
01:36:55.166 --> 01:36:56.166
Lakshmi Talkies!

1680
01:36:56.233 --> 01:36:58.633
You have found a way
to fill your coffers.

1681
01:37:08.666 --> 01:37:09.633
Gopika?

1682
01:37:09.733 --> 01:37:12.000
Come to the theater
at six in the evening without fail.

1683
01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.233
Inform all your friends.

1684
01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:17.200
-Okay?
-Okay. miss.

1685
01:37:20.366 --> 01:37:21.766
You too must come in the evening. sir.

1686
01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:23.433
But is this technically possible. sir?

1687
01:37:24.133 --> 01:37:26.433
Madam. we have
got a new projector from Singapore.

1688
01:37:26.733 --> 01:37:28.500
We can connect it
to the VCR and play it. sir.

1689
01:37:48.366 --> 01:37:50.133
Wait!
Today there is no show for you.

1690
01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:52.133
You can leave.
This is only for small kids.

1691
01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:53.633
-Go now.
-This show is not for you.

1692
01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:55.700
It is for the bigger kids. okay?
Now go home.

1693
01:37:57.566 --> 01:37:58.766
Hey. where are you going?

1694
01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:00.566
It's okay. He can come as well.

1695
01:38:31.466 --> 01:38:32.366
What is this?

1696
01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.233
-This is not <i>Arunachalam.</i>
-It is not?

1697
01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:35.400
Why are they showing a board?

1698
01:38:35.466 --> 01:38:36.700
They said they'll show <i>Arunachalam.</i>

1699
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.333
<i>Hey. kids! How are you?</i>

1700
01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:40.600
<i>Focus. sir. Focus.</i>

1701
01:38:40.733 --> 01:38:43.233
-Hey! It is our Bala sir.
<i>-Focus?</i>

1702
01:38:43.333 --> 01:38:44.333
-What?
-Hey it's Bala sir.

1703
01:38:44.766 --> 01:38:46.633
-Hey. it's Bala sir.
-Bala sir.

1704
01:38:46.766 --> 01:38:48.033
Isn't that Bala sir?

1705
01:38:48.566 --> 01:38:49.733
<i>-Is it okay now?</i>
-Sir!

1706
01:38:50.766 --> 01:38:53.133
<i>-Ready. sir! Action!</i>
<i>-Yes. okay.</i>

1707
01:38:55.333 --> 01:38:57.100
<i>So. how are you all?</i>

1708
01:38:57.166 --> 01:38:58.466
-We are fine. sir.
-We are fine. sir.

1709
01:38:58.633 --> 01:39:00.300
<i>Do you think about me?</i>

1710
01:39:00.433 --> 01:39:01.666
-Always. sir.
-Always. sir.

1711
01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:03.666
<i>I always think about you kids.</i>

1712
01:39:06.466 --> 01:39:07.366
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

1713
01:39:07.466 --> 01:39:10.700
<i>I was not there when you</i>
<i>needed me the most.</i>

1714
01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.233
<i>That will never happen again.</i>

1715
01:39:15.666 --> 01:39:17.166
<i>We have one month for the exams. right?</i>

1716
01:39:18.666 --> 01:39:20.466
<i>Okay. no problem.</i>

1717
01:39:21.466 --> 01:39:25.600
<i>From today onwards. from six to nine.</i>
<i>your classes will be conducted here.</i>

1718
01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:29.133
<i>Math. physics. and chemistry</i>
<i>classes will be taken here by me.</i>

1719
01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:33.433
<i>Mr. Thanikachalam and Meenakshi madam</i>
<i>will cover the rest at school.</i>

1720
01:39:35.066 --> 01:39:37.100
<i>The 70 and 80 percent</i>
<i>that you scored in the 11th standard</i>

1721
01:39:37.166 --> 01:39:38.400
<i>will not be sufficient this time.</i>

1722
01:39:38.666 --> 01:39:42.000
<i>This time all of you must</i>
<i>score not less than 90 percent.</i>

1723
01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.000
Ninety percent?

1724
01:39:46.066 --> 01:39:48.266
<i>That will be a piece of cake for you.</i>
<i>I know that.</i>

1725
01:39:48.533 --> 01:39:52.133
<i>But our target is not only 12th marks.</i>

1726
01:40:05.266 --> 01:40:07.733
What is this? TNPCEE?

1727
01:40:11.233 --> 01:40:12.666
<i>Are you scared. Kumar?</i>

1728
01:40:13.333 --> 01:40:14.533
Yes.

1729
01:40:17.733 --> 01:40:19.366
<i>How long will you be afraid?</i>

1730
01:40:19.566 --> 01:40:21.166
<i>How long will you be like this?</i>

1731
01:40:25.066 --> 01:40:26.300
<i>Study so hard…</i>

1732
01:40:27.266 --> 01:40:30.400
<i>That this whole village</i>
<i>will be proud of you.</i>

1733
01:40:33.366 --> 01:40:36.366
<i>Those who said</i>
<i>you don't need an education…</i>

1734
01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:41.766
<i>those who ill-treated you</i>
<i>because of your status…</i>

1735
01:40:43.666 --> 01:40:46.666
<i>those who think girls</i>
<i>are just for marriage.</i>

1736
01:40:46.733 --> 01:40:48.100
<i>and all those people…</i>

1737
01:40:49.533 --> 01:40:51.200
<i>All those people</i>
<i>must speak proudly of you.</i>

1738
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.400
<i>To look at you…</i>

1739
01:40:58.666 --> 01:41:00.266
<i>they must lift their heads up.</i>

1740
01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.666
<i>If it takes penance</i>
<i>to achieve it. we will do it.</i>

1741
01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:09.666
<i>Those who are willing</i>
<i>to join me in this penance.</i>

1742
01:41:10.233 --> 01:41:11.300
<i>raise your hands.</i>

1743
01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:35.200
I am ready. sir!

1744
01:41:41.766 --> 01:41:44.466
-Me too. sir!
-I am ready!

1745
01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:51.300
We are ready. sir.

1746
01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:02.233
<i>Let’s rise at dusk</i>

1747
01:42:02.533 --> 01:42:04.366
<i>Let’s hail the war</i>

1748
01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:08.766
<i>Let’s prove our will is our weapon</i>

1749
01:42:09.466 --> 01:42:11.133
<i>Let’s sever pain</i>

1750
01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.266
<i>Let’s till dreams</i>

1751
01:42:13.533 --> 01:42:16.066
<i>In the thickening darkness</i>
<i>Let’s become the brilliant pole stars</i>

1752
01:42:16.166 --> 01:42:18.700
<i>-Let a hundred thunderbolts land</i>
-Tickets are sold out. It's a full house!

1753
01:42:19.066 --> 01:42:20.000
It's all sold out.

1754
01:42:24.766 --> 01:42:26.666
Students have some doubts.

1755
01:42:30.166 --> 01:42:31.300
Alright.

1756
01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.000
We are staging a play called
<i>Ravana Kaviyam</i> for <i>Shivarathri.</i>

1757
01:42:37.066 --> 01:42:38.166
And you must surely come.

1758
01:42:46.466 --> 01:42:47.500
Great play!

1759
01:42:48.166 --> 01:42:50.266
<i>The guy who played Ravana stole the show.</i>

1760
01:43:02.766 --> 01:43:07.666
I will visit every Sunday
and clear all your doubts.

1761
01:43:08.166 --> 01:43:09.100
Okay?

1762
01:43:10.566 --> 01:43:11.766
Brother. please take this.

1763
01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:13.366
No need. sir.

1764
01:43:13.566 --> 01:43:15.033
This was a sleazy old theater.

1765
01:43:15.133 --> 01:43:17.133
But because of you.
it has become a school now.

1766
01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.166
That alone is enough for me.

1767
01:43:18.233 --> 01:43:19.766
Remember everything I told you.

1768
01:43:20.033 --> 01:43:21.100
Here. take the class.

1769
01:43:41.033 --> 01:43:42.633
Sir. what are you doing here
at this time?

1770
01:43:43.233 --> 01:43:45.200
Aren't you the head
of invigilators in this center?

1771
01:43:45.266 --> 01:43:46.166
Yes. sir.

1772
01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.166
Some of our students wrote their
exams here.

1773
01:43:48.233 --> 01:43:49.433
I asked you to take care of them.

1774
01:43:49.533 --> 01:43:50.433
Did you?

1775
01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:51.566
-I did. sir.
-Hey. Mr. Thirupathi.

1776
01:43:51.633 --> 01:43:53.433
-Okay. let's meet later.
-Thank you. sir.

1777
01:43:53.566 --> 01:43:54.733
How are you. sir?

1778
01:43:56.533 --> 01:43:57.566
Who are you?

1779
01:43:57.633 --> 01:43:59.466
I am Muthupandian's daughter.

1780
01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:03.000
-Pandian's daughter?
-Sozhavaram president's daughter. sir.

1781
01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:04.300
What are you doing here?

1782
01:44:04.366 --> 01:44:06.333
Sir. this is our examination center.

1783
01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:07.700
Today was our last exam.

1784
01:44:08.466 --> 01:44:10.533
-We have all performed well.
-Yes. sir.

1785
01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:12.100
-We will take your leave. sir.
-Bye. sir.

1786
01:44:12.166 --> 01:44:13.400
See you. sir.

1787
01:44:19.533 --> 01:44:20.600
Sir. did you call me?

1788
01:44:22.033 --> 01:44:23.133
The name is Balamurugan.

1789
01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:24.400
Enquire about his whereabouts.

1790
01:44:27.466 --> 01:44:29.133
Why is she studying so hard?

1791
01:44:29.266 --> 01:44:31.000
Your daughter wants
to become an engineer.

1792
01:44:31.166 --> 01:44:32.200
That is totally not necessary.

1793
01:44:32.266 --> 01:44:34.700
We are going to get her married
this year and send her to America.

1794
01:44:35.766 --> 01:44:38.633
I don't want anyone to send
or take me to America.

1795
01:44:39.333 --> 01:44:40.766
I will study hard
and go to America myself.

1796
01:44:41.266 --> 01:44:45.200
<i>You live only once. you die only once</i>
<i>Go boldly. go boldly</i>

1797
01:44:45.333 --> 01:44:46.266
I wish to study. sir

1798
01:44:46.333 --> 01:44:49.733
<i>The stronger trying to suppress the weaker</i>
<i>Is that right? Is that right?</i>

1799
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.566
<i>To set the world ablaze</i>
<i>with the fire of knowledge</i>

1800
01:44:51.633 --> 01:44:52.666
<i>You stand upright. you stand upright</i>

1801
01:44:52.766 --> 01:44:55.466
These are the best students
from all our branches. sir.

1802
01:44:55.633 --> 01:44:57.000
Top-rank aspects!

1803
01:44:58.633 --> 01:45:01.633
<i>Were we born to fall down?</i>
<i>Let’s rise up like seeds</i>

1804
01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.466
<i>-If there is a light in your heart</i>
-Take these tapes.

1805
01:45:05.533 --> 01:45:06.666
-Be careful.
-Okay. sir.

1806
01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:11.600
<i>Come. let’s hold the banner high</i>

1807
01:45:11.666 --> 01:45:15.766
<i>Ahead. move ahead</i>

1808
01:45:16.133 --> 01:45:20.166
<i>You are a boundless wild river</i>

1809
01:45:20.466 --> 01:45:24.533
<i>You need not shed tears!</i>

1810
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.500
Bala is not here. sir.

1811
01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:30.733
But the classes have been
recorded in cassettes. and they

1812
01:45:31.066 --> 01:45:32.200
<i>are playing it here in the theater.</i>

1813
01:45:32.266 --> 01:45:33.366
Video class?

1814
01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.266
Yes. sir.

1815
01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:38.066
Hello?

1816
01:45:38.266 --> 01:45:39.333
Yes?

1817
01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:42.366
He is in your village. in a cinema
theater. and is taking video classes.

1818
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.066
Are you happily sitting at home
and watching TV?

1819
01:45:46.333 --> 01:45:47.700
Oh. no! Brother-in-law. I did…

1820
01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.066
What is a video class?

1821
01:45:51.133 --> 01:45:52.400
Hey. listen to me.

1822
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.500
There is a TNPCEE exam tomorrow.

1823
01:45:54.733 --> 01:45:56.566
Make sure no one
from your village attends it.

1824
01:46:01.266 --> 01:46:02.300
Brother-in-law…

1825
01:46:03.333 --> 01:46:05.400
there is a limit
to iniquity and injustice.

1826
01:46:06.433 --> 01:46:08.733
If we cross that limit.
even we would cease to exist in politics.

1827
01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:14.500
All these days. I was thinking that
you would be of some use to me.

1828
01:46:15.533 --> 01:46:18.700
But I didn't realize that you
were using me.

1829
01:46:19.666 --> 01:46:21.066
Just saying!

1830
01:46:23.066 --> 01:46:24.333
-Why are you so late?
-Mom…

1831
01:46:24.433 --> 01:46:25.633
How many times to tell you?

1832
01:46:25.766 --> 01:46:27.600
Hey! Don't scold her.

1833
01:46:28.066 --> 01:46:31.500
Shouldn't I be concerned if a teenage
girl comes home at this hour?

1834
01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:33.166
You go inside.

1835
01:46:34.133 --> 01:46:35.500
You and your daughter!

1836
01:46:37.766 --> 01:46:39.133
Are you studying well?

1837
01:46:39.666 --> 01:46:40.766
Yes. Dad.

1838
01:46:41.066 --> 01:46:42.133
Okay. go to bed.

1839
01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:43.733
Tomorrow you have an exam.

1840
01:46:44.066 --> 01:46:44.766
Okay. Dad.

1841
01:46:54.533 --> 01:46:56.133
You know the answer
to these questions. right?

1842
01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:57.100
Yes.

1843
01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:00.533
-You studied this?
-Tell me this one.

1844
01:47:03.433 --> 01:47:05.366
Hey. this is the bus.
Stop!

1845
01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:11.233
-Come on.
-Come. guys.

1846
01:47:13.466 --> 01:47:14.533
Hey! Come. guys!

1847
01:47:15.466 --> 01:47:18.133
Hey. why did you stop the bus?
Have you lost it?

1848
01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:20.700
Hey! Sit down.

1849
01:47:21.766 --> 01:47:23.100
Sit down quietly.

1850
01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:26.033
We have hijacked this bus
for the next three hours.

1851
01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.100
No shouting!

1852
01:47:27.266 --> 01:47:28.766
That is not possible.
We have an exam.

1853
01:47:29.133 --> 01:47:30.466
Where are you going to write?
Sit down.

1854
01:47:31.066 --> 01:47:32.766
-How dare you touch us?
-Hey. Gopalakrishna!

1855
01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:34.300
No bad words.

1856
01:47:35.533 --> 01:47:37.400
All of you sit quietly
and study for your exams.

1857
01:47:38.033 --> 01:47:39.066
Mahalakshmi. take your book.

1858
01:47:47.066 --> 01:47:49.433
What am I saying.
and what are you doing?

1859
01:47:49.666 --> 01:47:50.633
Aren’t you kids scared?

1860
01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:52.533
-No. man!
-Why. man?

1861

<i>It's time to defend</i>

Come on. sir.

1899
01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:18.333
Let’s go. It’s getting late.

1900
01:50:35.533 --> 01:50:36.433
What happened?

1901

TAMIL NADU STATE TRANSPORT CORPORATION

Go. Go!

Bala sir!

Sir!

1907

Don't cry. sir.

1908
01:52:02.133 --> 01:52:04.600
Sir. please stop the vehicle.
Please stop.

1909
01:52:06.533 --> 01:52:09.233
Sir. the kids have an exam in town.

1910
01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:10.700
Can you please drop them off
in your cart?

1911
01:52:11.133 --> 01:52:14.033
We are taking grains to the market.
There's no room.

1912
01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:15.000
It is very difficult.

1913
01:52:15.066 --> 01:52:16.233
Sir. please see what you can do.

1914
01:52:16.333 --> 01:52:17.766
Their future depends on this exam.

1915

I am telling…

1916
01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.433
Hey. old man! What are you doing?

1917
01:52:26.566 --> 01:52:27.466
Have you gone mad?

1918
01:52:27.566 --> 01:52:29.066
Why are you throwing away
the rice sacks?

1919
01:52:30.633 --> 01:52:32.766
Hey! I am not mad.

1920
01:52:33.033 --> 01:52:34.366
This is my duty.

1921
01:52:35.633 --> 01:52:38.233
I can sell this anytime in the future.

1922
01:52:38.366 --> 01:52:40.600
Kids have an exam to go to.

1923
01:52:40.666 --> 01:52:43.033
Their future depends on this exam.

1924
01:52:44.166 --> 01:52:46.166
Shut up and unload the cart. Do it.

1925
01:52:47.466 --> 01:52:50.466
What are you staring at?
Unload the cart.

1926
01:52:52.566 --> 01:52:54.200
Hey. put it down

1927
01:52:55.466 --> 01:52:56.500
Put it.

1928
01:53:05.466 --> 01:53:07.633
Come on. get on it.

1929
01:53:29.766 --> 01:53:32.000
-Thank you so much. sir.
-Thank you.

1930
01:54:10.033 --> 01:54:11.700
WELCOME TO CHOLAVARAM

Today is the result of
our entrance exam.

1932
01:54:31.133 --> 01:54:33.533
We are very nervous. brother.
Can you check and tell me?

1933
01:54:37.633 --> 01:54:39.000
Did you all secure a rank. sir?

1934
01:54:40.433 --> 01:54:41.666
What was your rank. sir?

We did it. dude.

1954
01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:48.133
We all have secured ranks. Mahesh.

1955
01:55:48.733 --> 01:55:51.533
Did all 45 of you get ranks. sir?

1956
01:55:54.366 --> 01:55:55.333
All 46 of us.

1957
01:55:55.633 --> 01:55:56.566
How is that possible. sir?

1958
01:55:56.633 --> 01:55:58.133
There were only 45 students. right?

1959
01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:01.600
A. M. Kumar.

1960
01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:04.033
A. M. Kumar. first rank.

1961
01:56:04.333 --> 01:56:05.766
-Who is that?
-Who?

1962
01:56:06.033 --> 01:56:07.033
Do you know who it is?

1963
01:56:07.666 --> 01:56:09.066
Who is A. M. Kumar?

1964
01:56:09.266 --> 01:56:10.266
We don’t know.

1965
01:56:10.466 --> 01:56:11.566
Who is it?

1966
01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:24.700
Including me…

1967
01:56:27.733 --> 01:56:29.100
Forty-six.

1968
01:56:48.033 --> 01:56:48.766
Congrats. dude!

1969
01:56:49.033 --> 01:56:50.633
Hey. it is our Muthu!

1970
01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:11.633
Sir asked me to hand these to you.

1971
01:57:15.333 --> 01:57:17.300
Muthu. tell me your full name.

1972
01:57:18.333 --> 01:57:20.300
Anandha Muthuvelkumar.

1973
01:57:20.533 --> 01:57:21.766
It’s too long. kiddo.

1974
01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:42.500
You did it. Bala!

1975
01:58:17.133 --> 01:58:22.066
1948
LAKSHMI TOURING TALKIES

1976
01:58:46.533 --> 01:58:49.366
Success!

1977
01:58:50.666 --> 01:58:52.566
Our Bala sir has won!

1978
01:59:10.566 --> 01:59:11.533
Ninth rank. right?

1979
01:59:12.533 --> 01:59:16.700
It will still cost you
three to four thousand per month.

1980
01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:20.100
You earn just 800 rupees
per month. right?

1981
01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:22.366
-Yes. sir.
-Don’t worry.

1982
01:59:22.566 --> 01:59:23.666
You need not borrow money.

1983
01:59:23.766 --> 01:59:26.466
I will take care of the expenses
of his education.

1984
01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:28.500
I will also send him
to America for his higher studies.

1985
01:59:29.733 --> 01:59:32.333
I will arrange a sub-inspector
job for you in Coimbatore.

1986
01:59:32.566 --> 01:59:34.533
I will set up a hotel for your
mother in the town.

1987
01:59:34.733 --> 01:59:36.266
You have to do just one thing.

1988
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.166
Just say that you got the marks

1989
01:59:38.233 --> 01:59:40.566
because of the coaching provided
to you by Thirupathi Coaching Center.

1990
01:59:41.333 --> 01:59:44.733
Sign this agreement. which says you
took a short-term course at our center.

1991
01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:46.666
The land your parents lost…

1992
01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:50.266
is yours from now.

1993
01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:53.100
Municipality Chairman post for you.

1994
02:00:06.766 --> 02:00:08.000
Bala is here. sir.

1995
02:00:13.066 --> 02:00:16.300
All your students have signed
the agreement with me.

1996
02:00:17.433 --> 02:00:21.100
Even in their sleep. they will say
Thirupathi got them the ranks.

1997
02:00:22.066 --> 02:00:26.233
If they utter your name in public even by
mistake. I will destroy their future.

1998
02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:27.500
Do you understand?

1999
02:00:31.066 --> 02:00:33.600
On that fateful day. during the assembly…

2000
02:00:34.633 --> 02:00:36.033
I didn’t even notice your face.

2001
02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:37.166
You were standing very far.

2002
02:00:38.033 --> 02:00:41.133
You were this small.
And you wanted to beat me in my game?

2003
02:00:43.566 --> 02:00:44.600
Thirupathi sir…

2004
02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:49.600
a while ago. you had said.
"Zero fees. zero education.

2005
02:00:49.766 --> 02:00:51.433
More fees. more education."

2006
02:00:53.266 --> 02:00:55.333
None of my students on that board

2007
02:00:55.666 --> 02:00:58.366
scored these ranks
by paying thousands of rupees.

2008
02:00:59.333 --> 02:01:02.566
Instead. you have spent lakhs of rupees
to buy their result

2009
02:01:03.033 --> 02:01:04.733
and their hard-earned victory.

2010
02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:06.533
Didn't you?

2011
02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:08.000
Do you call this a victory?

2012
02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:14.733
Okay. sir!

2013
02:01:15.133 --> 02:01:16.033
Thank you. sir!

2014
02:01:16.566 --> 02:01:17.600
Take care. sir!

2015
02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:49.033
<i>A man who had no belief in you.</i>

2016
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.366
<i>A man who ill-treated you</i>
<i>Today. stands in front of your house.</i>

2017
02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:58.666
<i>requesting you to become</i>
<i>brand ambassadors for his institutions.</i>

2018
02:01:59.533 --> 02:02:00.633
<i>He is requesting you.</i>

2019
02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:03.533
<i>Like how Sachin represents Boost.</i>

2020
02:02:06.266 --> 02:02:08.566
<i>I wanted this kind of respect for you.</i>

2021
02:02:09.133 --> 02:02:10.066
<i>And you have earned it.</i>

2022
02:02:10.566 --> 02:02:12.400
<i>Great! Go and sign it.</i>

2023
02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:16.100
<i>Sign the contract.</i>

2024
02:02:16.333 --> 02:02:17.233
But. sir?

2025
02:02:17.333 --> 02:02:18.400
What is he saying?

2026
02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:22.233
<i>Education became a business long ago.</i>

2027
02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:25.666
<i>It will become an even bigger business</i>
<i>in the future.</i>

2028
02:02:27.033 --> 02:02:29.366
<i>The fees that they charge</i>
<i>for the 11th and 12th today.</i>

2029
02:02:29.433 --> 02:02:32.166
<i>Will be charged</i>
<i>for kindergarten schools in the future.</i>

2030
02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:36.233
<i>Thirupathi is just</i>
<i>the one person that we know.</i>

2031
02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:38.700
<i>There are many such men in</i>
<i>this country.</i>

2032
02:02:41.233 --> 02:02:43.366
<i>Is Thirupathi taking care</i>
<i>of your academic expenses?</i>

2033
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:44.733
<i>Let him do so.</i>

2034
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.266
<i>Is he fulfilling the promises</i>
<i>he made to your families?</i>

2035
02:02:47.566 --> 02:02:48.600
<i>Let him fulfill.</i>

2036
02:02:48.666 --> 02:02:50.400
<i>Is he sending you abroad</i>
<i>for higher studies?</i>

2037
02:02:50.533 --> 02:02:51.500
<i>Let him send you.</i>

2038
02:02:51.566 --> 02:02:55.100
<i>Use his ego</i>
<i>to climb up the ladder of success.</i>

2039
02:02:55.666 --> 02:02:57.766
<i>Settle in a good position.</i>

2040
02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:00.166
<i>Then…</i>

2041
02:03:01.733 --> 02:03:06.366
<i>provide free education to those</i>
<i>who cannot afford it.</i>

2042
02:03:08.166 --> 02:03:10.666
<i>Just like you. make them winners.</i>

2043
02:03:13.433 --> 02:03:15.000
<i>There are 46 of you.</i>

2044
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
<i>If you make up your mind.</i>
<i>you can change so many lives.</i>

2045
02:03:21.266 --> 02:03:22.266
<i>Just sign it.</i>

2046
02:03:56.233 --> 02:04:01.066
I will never forget my first day
at Thirupathi Coaching Center.

2047
02:04:06.733 --> 02:04:10.300
Teachers discovered my talents
and encouraged me a lot.

2048
02:04:12.133 --> 02:04:14.133
This is your place.
Now go.

2049
02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:16.700
When I made a mistake.
they reprimanded me.

2050
02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:24.100
They guided me on the right path.

2051
02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:30.666
They set a goal for me
and helped me achieve it.

2052
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:39.033
I…

2053
02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:42.400
don’t have parents.

2054
02:04:45.166 --> 02:04:47.200
Thirupathi Coaching Center is my family.

2055
02:04:49.033 --> 02:04:50.633
Everyone goes there with their parents.

2056
02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:53.200
I have no one.

2057
02:04:53.333 --> 02:04:54.666
Can you ask if he will come with me?

2058
02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:12.300
<i>He left.</i>

2059
02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:16.466
<i>Just like. how God would vanish</i>
<i>after giving a boon. he vanished.</i>

2060
02:05:17.333 --> 02:05:19.200
<i>He might have thought</i>
<i>that his presence there</i>

2061
02:05:19.266 --> 02:05:21.233
<i>might put us in trouble with Thirupathi.</i>

2062
02:05:21.533 --> 02:05:22.500
<i>He left.</i>

2063
02:05:22.733 --> 02:05:25.466
<i>To this day.</i>
<i>none of us have seen Bala sir.</i>

2064
02:05:27.033 --> 02:05:30.333
<i>We have turned the theater.</i>
<i>where Bala sir taught us.</i>

2065
02:05:31.133 --> 02:05:33.333
<i>into a coaching center.</i>

2066
02:05:34.366 --> 02:05:37.500
<i>All 46 of us take turns throughout</i>
<i>the year and take classes for</i>

2067
02:05:37.766 --> 02:05:39.366
<i>these underprivileged kids.</i>

2068
02:05:42.233 --> 02:05:43.766
-Hey. Abi! It’s your grandpa!
-Abi! It’s your grandpa!

2069
02:05:48.266 --> 02:05:50.033
<i>We don’t sell education here.</i>

2070
02:05:50.166 --> 02:05:51.366
<i>We distribute it like food in a temple.</i>

2071
02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:06.666
Where is Bala sir now?

2072
02:06:07.166 --> 02:06:08.166
<i>I don’t know.</i>

2073
02:06:21.633 --> 02:06:23.300
Brother. please give me a bun.

2074
02:06:37.133 --> 02:06:38.166
Here.

2075
02:06:39.066 --> 02:06:40.200
Thanks.

2076
02:06:41.366 --> 02:06:43.566
-Do you want to study?
-Yes. sir.

2077
02:06:45.766 --> 02:06:47.100
Come with me.

2078
02:06:50.366 --> 02:06:53.366

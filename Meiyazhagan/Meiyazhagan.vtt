WEBVTT

00:43.166 --> 00:44.250
RAMA KRISHNAN

00:44.333 --> 00:45.541
THEY SAY YOU ARE GONE.

00:45.625 --> 00:47.958
WE DON'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT EITHER.

01:30.583 --> 01:31.958
LOVE IS GOD

01:32.041 --> 01:33.416
LOVE IS FULFILLMENT

01:33.500 --> 01:34.875
LOVE IS HIDDEN

01:34.958 --> 01:38.500
LOVE IS THE ULTIMATE TRUTH

02:22.416 --> 02:23.250
What’s going on, brother?

02:23.500 --> 02:25.166
You still haven't gone home,
and now you're sleeping here!

02:25.500 --> 02:27.583
Do you want to come
and sleep with me in the shed?

02:27.708 --> 02:29.125
I'll even give you
the coconut leafstalk to eat.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.166
You can ask him yourself.

02:31.375 --> 02:32.958
When he first came here,
he was just a baby!

02:33.375 --> 02:34.750
He used to barely reach your shoulder.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.916
Now when you stand,
you're only as tall as his shoulder.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.458
I've fed him everything
to make him this tall and healthy.

02:42.041 --> 02:42.916
What do you say, baby?

02:43.208 --> 02:44.083
My fat baby!

02:44.416 --> 02:45.291
Fat baby!

02:52.750 --> 02:55.875
Grandpa, take him and go. It's late.

02:56.541 --> 02:57.375
He must be hungry.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.291
Go, my dear.

02:59.875 --> 03:00.750
Come on, let’s go!

03:02.291 --> 03:03.125
Come on…

03:03.958 --> 03:04.833
-Grandpa.
-Come.

03:07.208 --> 03:08.625
We are leaving town permanently.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.291
We lost the house!

03:23.791 --> 03:25.791
Hey! Mozhi! Mozhi!

03:26.041 --> 03:26.875
Hey!

03:28.666 --> 03:30.625
Why is he walking away
without answering?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.875
Hey, have this. Have this.

03:55.833 --> 03:59.250
<i>I'm leaving! I'm leaving!</i>

03:59.333 --> 04:02.416
<i>As a mere skeleton, I'm leaving!</i>

04:03.541 --> 04:10.541
<i>Toward the agonizing path, I leave!</i>

04:11.375 --> 04:14.458
<i>Where my childhood's free spirit</i>
<i>Danced in eternal joy!</i>

04:14.541 --> 04:18.708
<i>From my hometown, I stand separated!</i>

04:19.833 --> 04:22.541
<i>From the home</i>
<i>My ancestors built and protected</i>

04:22.625 --> 04:25.916
<i>I stand separated!</i>

04:27.333 --> 04:31.208
<i>I'm leaving! I'm leaving!</i>

04:31.291 --> 04:34.583
<i>As a mere skeleton, I'm leaving!</i>

04:35.625 --> 04:39.833
<i>Toward the agonizing path</i>

04:39.916 --> 04:43.208
<i>I leave!</i>

04:49.875 --> 04:50.958
Where the hell have you been?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.291
Have you blabbed anything to anyone?

04:55.333 --> 04:57.250
Sir, why are you
leaving at this hour

04:57.666 --> 04:59.125
without even informing me?

04:59.583 --> 05:03.041
-Uncle, when did you get here?
-I came a while ago.

05:03.458 --> 05:04.416
Where are you coming from?

05:07.291 --> 05:09.166
The wealth has been divided
and the house has been written off.

05:10.125 --> 05:12.083
When it's no longer ours… no point…

05:13.333 --> 05:14.833
Why should you leave our native then?

05:14.958 --> 05:16.833
-You can rent…
-You think, I…

05:17.416 --> 05:19.333
Our three generations have lived
in this house and town.

05:20.791 --> 05:23.041
Forget it, certain things cannot
be understood by words.

05:23.458 --> 05:24.583
Not that I don't understand, sir.

05:25.083 --> 05:28.791
But leaving this house is a
bigger blow for him than you.

05:29.625 --> 05:30.708
Just take care of him, sir.

05:44.833 --> 05:45.666
Mozhi,

05:47.708 --> 05:50.333
I am going to take Bhuvana
to Needamangalam.

05:50.833 --> 05:51.708
Why?

05:52.208 --> 05:53.458
Can't stay here, right?

05:53.708 --> 05:56.958
I've finalized a school there,
based on your dad's recommendation.

06:07.875 --> 06:10.958
<i>O' time are you being fair?</i>

06:11.791 --> 06:15.750
<i>Are my eyes witnessing a mirage?</i>

06:15.833 --> 06:20.250
<i>What could be the sin that I committed?</i>

06:20.791 --> 06:23.750
<i>A life of deceit surrounds me!</i>

06:23.833 --> 06:26.833
<i>A nurturing mother's lap</i>

06:27.791 --> 06:31.791
<i>Torn apart by the greed of kith and kin</i>

06:31.875 --> 06:34.625
<i>All the tomorrows</i>

06:34.833 --> 06:39.375
<i>Stand shattered!</i>

06:39.750 --> 06:43.791
<i>A kite that danced</i>
<i>Along with the thread!</i>

06:43.875 --> 06:47.541
<i>Now I am lost with a broken thread!</i>

06:47.916 --> 06:51.833
<i>Like an uprooted blooming tree</i>

06:51.916 --> 06:55.125
<i>I've become a tragic sight!</i>

06:55.833 --> 06:59.833
<i>Like a river that</i>
<i>Runs deep in the forest</i>

06:59.916 --> 07:03.416
<i>I am lost!</i>

07:03.833 --> 07:07.041
<i>Like a bird that ceases</i>
<i>To live in its own nest</i>

07:07.125 --> 07:10.458
<i>A refugee, I become!</i>

07:11.083 --> 07:14.500
<i>I'm leaving! I'm leaving!</i>

07:14.583 --> 07:17.708
<i>As a mere skeleton, I'm leaving!</i>

07:18.583 --> 07:23.000
<i>Towards the agonizing path</i>

07:23.083 --> 07:26.458
<i>I leave!</i>

07:59.708 --> 08:01.791
<i>What will I say?</i>

08:01.875 --> 08:03.833
<i>How will I comfort myself?</i>

08:03.916 --> 08:05.833
<i>This fatal curse!</i>

08:05.916 --> 08:07.708
<i>How will I change it?</i>

08:07.791 --> 08:09.708
<i>The conspiracy's path</i>

08:09.791 --> 08:11.750
<i>That's filled with darkness</i>

08:11.833 --> 08:14.666
<i>How will I shine the light?</i>

08:15.791 --> 08:17.750
<i>I leave today!</i>

08:17.833 --> 08:19.750
<i>But when will I be back?</i>

08:19.833 --> 08:23.625
<i>When will I return</i>
<i>To my own doorway?</i>

08:23.708 --> 08:27.750
<i>To rescue me back home</i>

08:27.833 --> 08:31.791
<i>When will I find an honest soul?</i>

08:31.875 --> 08:35.750
<i>Without the people of my land</i>

08:35.833 --> 08:39.083
<i>Will I lead a life?</i>

08:39.750 --> 08:43.791
<i>I am like a lonely bubble</i>

08:43.875 --> 08:46.083
<i>That never flows with the water!</i>

08:52.500 --> 08:53.333
You lock it.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.708
Give it to them, brother.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.291
Dirty rogues!

09:27.708 --> 09:28.916
I curse them from the bottom of my heart!

09:29.041 --> 09:30.583
-They won't live well!
-Sokkalingam!

09:31.708 --> 09:33.416
We have only lost our wealth.

09:34.291 --> 09:35.458
All of you are standing by us.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.041
Forget it. We'll find a way.

09:38.416 --> 09:40.458
What you say might come true!

09:41.375 --> 09:43.416
No matter what,
they are my siblings.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.500
That's the curse of the girl child, they
are mere puppets dancing to others' tunes!

09:47.000 --> 09:48.208
How can we curse them?

09:49.875 --> 09:51.250
Brother, you are an educated man.

09:51.916 --> 09:54.708
I can't be as mature as you.

09:56.666 --> 09:58.625
Forget about me!
Forget about you!

09:59.166 --> 10:00.041
What about him?

10:01.708 --> 10:04.541
This house was his world…
This town was his everything!

10:05.416 --> 10:06.708
Now all of a sudden,

10:07.375 --> 10:10.000
what will happen to my child?

10:19.625 --> 10:20.500
Hey…

10:25.708 --> 10:26.916
Why, brother?

10:27.083 --> 10:28.541
-Keep it.
-I have money.

10:28.916 --> 10:30.833
For the bus fare
and also get her something.

10:33.208 --> 10:35.333
Are you upset with me
because we lost the house?

10:35.625 --> 10:36.458
No, brother.

10:36.833 --> 10:40.458
If you're here, I'll make excuses
and come to see you once a week.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.958
I wonder if I can do that now.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.208
That's the only thing
I am feeling bad about, brother.

10:58.750 --> 10:59.625
Bhuvana.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.166
My dear…

11:02.833 --> 11:03.875
Shall I leave now?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.916
No, even I will come with you.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.541
Your brother is going to Madras, darling.

11:09.625 --> 11:10.791
I will also come.

11:13.166 --> 11:16.291
Tomorrow you have to go to school,
so go with Dad.

11:16.625 --> 11:17.833
When I come back,

11:17.916 --> 11:21.041
I will get you lots of chocolates
and clothes and come to visit you, okay?

11:21.208 --> 11:22.958
I don't want chocolates.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.000
I will also come with you.

11:25.083 --> 11:26.916
There will be a school in Madras,

11:27.125 --> 11:29.083
you and I can go
on the cycle together.

11:31.208 --> 11:32.041
Come, my darling.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.416
-Come.
-Go to Daddy.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.166
-Bhuvana…
-I want to go to my brother…

11:37.250 --> 11:39.166
-Come to me.
-I want to go to my brother.

11:43.125 --> 11:46.208
-Stop crying, baby…
-I want to go to my brother.

11:46.291 --> 11:47.250
Okay, dear.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.750
Arul, you come in the van
with all the things.

11:58.208 --> 11:59.916
Your mother, brother
and I will come by bus.

12:01.625 --> 12:03.250
-Have you loaded everything?
-Yes, sir.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.375
-Just take another look around the house.
-Okay, sir.

12:05.541 --> 12:06.458
We can't come back here again.

12:06.541 --> 12:07.791
-Okay, sir.
-Stop the vehicle if you need anything.

12:07.875 --> 12:09.166
-Do you want water or anything else?
-Brother.

12:09.875 --> 12:11.958
Sir, we forgot to load your son's cycle.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.125
Cycle?

12:13.791 --> 12:15.416
Arul, do you need it?

12:16.208 --> 12:17.083
Will you ride it?

12:24.708 --> 12:25.791
-No, Dad.
-Wait.

12:26.250 --> 12:27.458
Give it to someone who needs it.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.208
No, not needed, let it be.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.458
Brother,

12:31.125 --> 12:33.375
you take this or give it away to someone.

12:35.541 --> 12:36.416
Shall we leave?

12:36.500 --> 12:37.875
-Yes, you guys get started.
-Okay.

12:43.041 --> 12:50.041

<i>Don't lose heart!</i>

12:53.875 --> 12:57.500
<i>Don't lose heart, son!</i>

12:57.875 --> 13:01.833
<i>For you, we'll wait!</i>

13:01.916 --> 13:05.916
<i>Go well and surely return!</i>

13:06.375 --> 13:13.375
<i>Go well!</i>
<i>Don't refrain from coming back, son!</i>

13:13.833 --> 13:17.791
<i>For you, we'll wait!</i>

13:17.875 --> 13:23.583
<i>Go well and surely return!</i>

THANJAVUR BORDER ENDS

14:51.875 --> 14:53.166
I am going out of town for a day.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.333
I'll go today
and come back tomorrow morning.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.333
She will feed you guys
in the evening, okay?

15:03.583 --> 15:05.083
Not that I want to go,

15:06.541 --> 15:07.583
but I have to go!

15:10.541 --> 15:12.333
It's just for a day.
I will be back tomorrow morning.

15:13.083 --> 15:13.916
Okay?

15:28.583 --> 15:29.416
Hey!

15:29.708 --> 15:31.000
It's getting late, aren't you leaving?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.375
I was wondering if I should go or not.

15:37.041 --> 15:38.708
It's okay if my husband doesn't go.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.625
I'll be happy that he's taken a day off.

15:40.708 --> 15:43.291
I will cook his favorites for all
three meals and sit admiring him!

15:44.416 --> 15:45.875
But you're Bhuvana's brother,

15:46.166 --> 15:47.000
you have to go.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.416
For twenty years, you haven't
let anyone connect with you,

15:53.333 --> 15:55.625
now these are the only set of people,
who we can call family.

15:55.958 --> 15:58.791
How can you think twice
about going to their function?

16:01.208 --> 16:02.208
It's not an issue for you, Arul.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.583
Even after all this,
you'll stay the same…

16:05.125 --> 16:05.958
Alone

16:06.208 --> 16:07.041
and angry.

16:07.958 --> 16:09.041
There is nothing wrong with that,

16:09.708 --> 16:11.666
but you have a daughter,
hope you remember that.

16:12.250 --> 16:16.333
She won't have any aunts,
uncles, and cousins in the future.

16:16.666 --> 16:18.791
It will be just us,
does that work for you?

16:19.291 --> 16:22.916
There are dogs, cats, parrots,
and a lot of other things, right?

16:26.333 --> 16:28.208
Are you scared to go back
to your native place, Arul?

16:36.375 --> 16:39.875
I know how much you love
that town and that house.

16:41.791 --> 16:45.125
Are you scared you will become
emotional and break down if you go there?

16:50.125 --> 16:51.875
Shall I hand-hold you carefully
and take you there?

16:57.791 --> 16:58.625
I will go.

17:03.291 --> 17:04.291
Hey, Valli! Bye!

17:04.375 --> 17:05.791
Hey! Come here.

17:07.375 --> 17:08.250
What?

17:08.333 --> 17:10.916
Don't look so grumpy
before going to our hometown.

17:11.708 --> 17:14.083
Don't get into any arguments
with anyone there.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.375
Just go and come back
without creating a scene.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.833
Oxygen molecule… double covalent bond.

17:20.708 --> 17:23.666
Make a note of everything and we will be…

17:26.125 --> 17:26.958
Arul.

17:31.000 --> 17:31.833
Arul.

17:34.958 --> 17:37.250
You can catch the train in the afternoon.
Why are you leaving now?

17:37.541 --> 17:38.833
The reception's in the evening.

17:38.916 --> 17:39.750
What will you even do
there after going now?

17:40.625 --> 17:42.583
I just thought I would
take a look around our town.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.833
I am in two minds whether to go or not.

17:48.625 --> 17:50.583
No, no, you go and come.

17:52.833 --> 17:54.458
What will you say, if they
ask you why I didn't come?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.375
-Shall I say you have a fever?
-Hey!

17:56.958 --> 17:58.666
-Shall I say grandmother died?
-Hey! Stop fooling around.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.500
No one will ask
why you didn't come…

18:01.583 --> 18:02.833
If they do, I will manage, Dad!

18:05.333 --> 18:06.375
Why are you not wearing your watch?

18:06.500 --> 18:07.500
I have my mobile.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.833
You're going to a wedding,
shouldn't you look smart?

18:12.333 --> 18:13.625
Is this your idea of "smart"?

18:14.166 --> 18:15.000
Wear it.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.666
-Wear it properly.
-I'll do it.

18:20.375 --> 18:21.208
Careful.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.041
-Go safely.
-Okay, bye.

18:23.291 --> 18:24.125
Call me after you reach.

OUR LADY OF LOURDES

20:54.041 --> 20:55.333
Stop right here.

20:56.875 --> 20:57.708
Thanks.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.416
Brother, there is someone at the gate,
check who it is.

21:40.541 --> 21:41.416
It's 203.

21:41.750 --> 21:42.750
Oh, sorry.

21:42.833 --> 21:43.666
Thanks.

22:08.750 --> 22:09.583
<i>I haven't started yet.</i>

22:10.333 --> 22:11.166
I am still in Thanjavur.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.083
GODDESS ANBIRPIRIYAL TEMPLE

22:12.291 --> 22:13.125
Still?

22:13.791 --> 22:15.750
It's getting late, leave soon.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.833
Why?

22:17.541 --> 22:19.125
To go there early and bump
into some unwanted faces?

22:20.208 --> 22:22.083
These are the people I never
wanted to see again in my life.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.416
I only came for Bhuvana's sake.

22:24.250 --> 22:25.375
I will only meet her and leave.

22:25.458 --> 22:26.291
<i>Hey!</i>

22:26.583 --> 22:27.958
Why are you talking like this?

22:28.041 --> 22:28.958
Then what?

22:29.666 --> 22:30.666
She's to be blamed for it all.

22:31.208 --> 22:32.416
To top it off, she texted me
while I was on my way…

22:32.666 --> 22:34.416
"I am not sure if you're
really coming or not,

22:34.583 --> 22:36.083
I'll wait at the reception,
if you don't turn up,

22:36.166 --> 22:37.750
I won't get married to him."
She's literally threatening me.

22:39.458 --> 22:42.041
She's quite capable of doing it.
After all, she's your sister.

22:43.541 --> 22:46.291
<i>Fine! What all have you done</i>
<i>since you reached?</i>

22:46.375 --> 22:47.208
Nothing much.

22:47.375 --> 22:49.083
I booked a room at
the Philomina Lodge and slept.

22:50.416 --> 22:52.958
I am probably the first person to
stay at a lodge in his own hometown.

22:53.833 --> 22:54.666
Okay.

22:57.791 --> 22:58.666
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

22:59.375 --> 23:00.375
I've come to the temple.

23:01.458 --> 23:02.500
This alone has remained the same.

23:21.041 --> 23:22.458
<i>When he first came here,</i>
<i>he was a baby!</i>

23:23.458 --> 23:24.833
<i>He used to just reach your shoulder.</i>

23:25.708 --> 23:28.333
<i>Now when you stand,</i>
<i>you're only as tall as his shoulder.</i>

23:32.291 --> 23:33.750
Arul, are you there?
Where did you go?

23:35.916 --> 23:36.791
Nothing.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.791
<i>Honestly, even though I came</i>
<i>because I had no choice,</i>

23:40.583 --> 23:43.666
it feels so good to see my hometown
after so many years.

23:44.041 --> 23:46.166
Then why don't you stay
for two days and come?

23:46.833 --> 23:51.041
But, our house owner was saying
he's planning to sell this house,

23:52.041 --> 23:53.500
so by then we will have to look
for another house.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.458
We should like the new house.

23:56.333 --> 23:57.625
They need to permit us
to keep the pets.

23:58.250 --> 23:59.250
The rent should be affordable.

23:59.708 --> 24:01.791
It should be within a three-kilometer
radius of our daughter's school.

24:02.708 --> 24:04.416
We'll have to change all
the address proof documents.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.375
Just thinking about all this is…

24:05.458 --> 24:06.500
Oh, God!

24:06.833 --> 24:08.250
We will cross the bridge
when we get to it.

24:08.333 --> 24:09.833
Don't start whining now…

24:10.583 --> 24:12.083
and add to the existing stress.

24:14.166 --> 24:16.541
He said that he was just thinking
about selling the house.

24:16.916 --> 24:18.000
We will deal with it when he sells it.

24:18.708 --> 24:19.583
I really don't know.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.166
Our destiny with houses
has always been a disaster.

24:23.833 --> 24:26.375
What if he suddenly comes in the middle
of the night and asks us to vacate?

24:28.458 --> 24:30.291
That's why I've been thinking
whether to look for another house or…

24:33.916 --> 24:35.041
I haven't even told you yet.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.166
What is it?

24:43.208 --> 24:45.291
Whether we should
just buy this house…

24:46.166 --> 24:47.083
Hey!

24:47.916 --> 24:49.375
Are you really saying this?

24:49.750 --> 24:52.333
What is there to be real
or not about this? I am just thinking.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.083
Hey! That's superb!

24:55.958 --> 24:56.791
Arul!

24:57.166 --> 24:58.750
You're going to buy me a house, Arul?

24:59.041 --> 25:02.333
Hey! Hang on!
That's why I don't tell you anything.

25:02.833 --> 25:04.625
Well, you have told me now. Relax!

25:05.416 --> 25:07.041
It makes me so happy to hear this.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.708
Oh, God!
I wanted to tell you this in person,

25:10.791 --> 25:12.083
but I've blabbered it all over the phone.

25:12.708 --> 25:14.416
The minute we buy the house,

25:14.541 --> 25:16.708
I am going to bore nails
into all the walls.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.333
Hema!

25:19.416 --> 25:21.416
He didn't even allow us to hang
two extra wedding photographs!

25:21.500 --> 25:22.583
That stingy owner!

25:22.875 --> 25:24.708
Always worried about
the walls developing cracks,

25:24.833 --> 25:26.083
water leakage, and whatnot.

25:26.583 --> 25:29.166
Just wait!
Hereafter, I will make the rules!

25:29.916 --> 25:31.000
Oh, my! Hema!

25:32.333 --> 25:33.750
Why don't you fully listen
to what I have to say?

25:34.208 --> 25:35.083
I won't listen.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.833
Why are you getting
excited beforehand?

25:37.208 --> 25:38.583
That's how I will get excited.
What will you do?

25:39.000 --> 25:39.833
Look,

25:39.916 --> 25:41.208
now don't imagine
something and then

25:41.416 --> 25:42.958
<i>blame it on me.</i>

25:43.833 --> 25:48.625
I just wanted to tell you that I am
only thinking about us buying this house.

25:48.875 --> 25:49.708
That's all.

25:49.791 --> 25:50.625
<i>Okay?</i>

25:50.708 --> 25:53.458
Mr. Arulmozhivarman,
son of Arivudai Nambi,

25:53.791 --> 25:57.541
<i>I know you too well. Even your</i>
<i>parents won't know you that well.</i>

25:58.041 --> 26:01.541
If you say that you're thinking about it,
that means you have decided on it.

26:01.916 --> 26:04.458
If you're asking for an opinion,
it simply means you're cross-checking.

26:04.833 --> 26:06.541
Okay, believe that.

26:07.291 --> 26:08.208
Actually, you…

26:09.708 --> 26:13.000
Amidst your blabbering,
I forgot what I wanted to tell you.

26:13.083 --> 26:14.583
THANJAVUR

26:14.666 --> 26:16.250
SALIYAMANGALAM

26:21.166 --> 26:22.833
NEEDAMANGALAM

26:34.375 --> 26:35.583
If anyone going to
Kombankudusai, Gnanam Nagar,

26:35.666 --> 26:37.458
and Mariamman Kovil is seated,
please get down.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.500
The next stop is at Saliyamangalam.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.666
GOVERNMENT TRANSPORT CORPORATION
KUMBAKONAM

26:59.000 --> 27:01.250
Sir, one ticket to Needamanglam.

27:01.625 --> 27:02.958
Why don't you have a 2000 rupee note?

27:05.916 --> 27:08.791
The bus has just started, how
can you give me a 500 rupee note?

27:08.916 --> 27:11.625
Sorry, I had no clue. I have change.

27:15.125 --> 27:15.958
Are you an outsider?

27:16.958 --> 27:18.500
No, I am from Thanjavur.

27:18.666 --> 27:20.000
It's been many years
since I left for Madras.

27:20.458 --> 27:22.666
No wonder you don't
seem new to the town,

27:22.833 --> 27:24.000
you just seem new to the bus.

27:24.916 --> 27:27.000
I said it because you're happily seated
in the conductor's seat.

27:27.083 --> 27:28.458
Oh! Sorry!

27:28.541 --> 27:30.500
-I forgot. I thought till you come…
-Sit…

27:30.583 --> 27:31.708
I still have more tickets to sell.

27:31.791 --> 27:33.458
If someone gets down at the next stop,
you can shift there.

27:34.208 --> 27:35.041
One ticket for Ayyampettai.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.375
Sir, a minute.

27:41.208 --> 27:43.375
I haven't been to Needamangalam,
so I have no clue.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.166
Let me know when the stop comes.

27:47.208 --> 27:48.083
Ticket… ticket…

27:49.541 --> 27:50.416
Ticket… ticket…

27:52.208 --> 27:54.541
-I'll tell you when it comes.
-Okay.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.625
THANJAVUR

28:13.833 --> 28:15.625
How many more stops to Needamangalam?

28:15.708 --> 28:16.875
A few more to go.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.333
Sit.

28:32.708 --> 28:33.666
Where in Thanjavur?

28:34.375 --> 28:35.666
Medical College Road.

28:36.041 --> 28:36.916
Road?

28:37.375 --> 28:39.791
No, I was just saying that because
you might not know the place.

28:39.875 --> 28:41.750
-Balaji Nagar.
-Where in Balaji Nagar?

28:41.833 --> 28:42.750
Second street.

28:43.041 --> 28:44.041
Whose house?

28:44.291 --> 28:45.458
What is your father's name?

28:45.666 --> 28:46.583
Arivudai Nambi.

28:47.416 --> 28:48.666
Oh, my God!

28:48.750 --> 28:50.208
You're Nambi sir's son?

28:51.375 --> 28:52.958
They told me you were abroad.

28:53.458 --> 28:56.416
No, my elder brother is,
I am in Madras.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.375
-I was also your father's student.
-Is it?

28:59.458 --> 29:01.000
Yes. The batch of '95.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.000
He was my science teacher
till the eighth standard.

29:03.416 --> 29:04.500
After that, he became the headmaster.

29:04.833 --> 29:05.666
They made him one.

29:05.958 --> 29:06.916
How many years has it been?

29:07.541 --> 29:08.416
Twenty-two.

29:09.125 --> 29:10.291
We left in '96.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.125
You left after
the property dispute, right?

29:14.500 --> 29:15.458
Even you seem to know.

29:16.583 --> 29:17.541
Now you have nothing here?

29:20.791 --> 29:21.708
Our people…

29:22.333 --> 29:24.250
We see good people as fools
and cheat them,

29:24.500 --> 29:26.833
but label the crooked as intelligent,
and celebrate them!

29:26.916 --> 29:27.916
Senseless people!

29:29.333 --> 29:30.875
Next time if he comes to Thanjavur,
let me know.

29:31.208 --> 29:32.083
I will come and see him.

29:33.041 --> 29:34.000
If he sees me,

29:34.083 --> 29:35.333
no, if you tell him my name
he will surely remember.

29:36.083 --> 29:36.916
Jagadeesan?

29:37.666 --> 29:38.833
-Jaggu.
-Jaggu.

29:39.916 --> 29:41.541
Will he come? Has he been visiting?

29:43.916 --> 29:45.666
After we left, he never returned.

29:46.125 --> 29:47.625
In order to avoid seeing
these relatives again…

29:48.000 --> 29:49.041
Did he say that?

29:49.708 --> 29:51.291
He didn't say that, I did.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.583
Exactly! He's not someone
who will say that.

29:53.708 --> 29:54.833
Why are you thinking like this?

29:55.291 --> 29:56.958
Are you saying I am wrong?

29:57.583 --> 29:58.791
Okay, forget it.

29:59.333 --> 30:00.875
After complaining about your
hometown and your relatives,

30:00.958 --> 30:01.791
how come you're here now?

30:02.541 --> 30:04.791
It's my sister's wedding.
My aunt's daughter.

30:05.666 --> 30:06.916
We grew up together
till a certain age.

30:07.750 --> 30:08.875
That's why I had to come.

30:08.958 --> 30:09.833
That's all it is.

30:09.916 --> 30:10.958
That's what I am saying as well.

30:11.166 --> 30:13.416
You don't have to be too friendly.
Even that's not good.

30:13.833 --> 30:15.791
But don't think all the relatives
are like those four,

30:15.875 --> 30:17.375
just forget about them
and focus on the rest.

30:17.708 --> 30:19.541
There may be many others
like your sister.

30:19.708 --> 30:20.750
Visit often.

30:21.708 --> 30:22.625
You're right,

30:23.708 --> 30:25.000
but I am not sure
I'll be okay with it.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.375
Even now I came because
my sister compelled me to,

30:27.458 --> 30:28.375
otherwise, I was not interested.

30:31.083 --> 30:32.250
Sir, can you help me?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.333
I haven't yet booked
my return ticket.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.541
I don't know when the reception
will begin and end.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.250
I will be meeting many people after
years, I am bound to get delayed.

30:40.166 --> 30:41.625
I have to leave tonight.

30:42.166 --> 30:48.125
So, if you tell me when the last bus
to Chennai is, I will leave accordingly.

30:48.375 --> 30:49.708
Then, what about the wedding?

30:50.208 --> 30:51.166
The wedding?

30:51.625 --> 30:52.458
No way!

30:52.750 --> 30:54.458
I am already waiting to get back.

30:54.666 --> 30:55.666
If it were up to me,
I'd run away right now!

30:56.291 --> 30:58.000
Since I am here now, I want
to make my presence felt,

30:58.083 --> 31:00.416
give the gift, and leave.
My job will be done then.

31:00.875 --> 31:01.791
How mean!

31:01.875 --> 31:03.291
Like an idiot, I offered you my seat.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.333
Coming back to Thanjavur
won't be feasible.

31:10.416 --> 31:12.291
There are private buses
from Needamangalam itself.

31:12.708 --> 31:14.833
The last bus is around 09:00
or 10:00 p.m.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.375
Just inquire about it
when you get down.

31:21.041 --> 31:22.000
Kovilvenni.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.375
Wait.

31:33.041 --> 31:35.583
Are they looking for a groom for you?
If not, let me know.

31:36.791 --> 31:37.708
Look at you blush!

31:38.083 --> 31:38.916
Let's go.

31:50.958 --> 31:53.083
Where did you say
the reception was happening?

31:55.291 --> 31:56.875
I don't remember the name, it
will be there on the invitation card.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.333
"Cholan Wedding Hall."

32:07.416 --> 32:08.875
Cholan Wedding Hall?

32:09.500 --> 32:10.458
Get down here itself.

32:10.708 --> 32:12.166
The gates won't open now.
It will take time.

32:12.583 --> 32:14.375
Everywhere else, the gates are only shut
if there's a train passing by.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.333
But it will be a problem if the train
halts at the Needamangalam station.

32:16.583 --> 32:19.416
Every day, they shut the gates
for almost ten hours and torture us.

32:21.750 --> 32:23.958
Go to that side, cross the gate,

32:24.125 --> 32:25.375
and take a right.

32:25.458 --> 32:26.375
You mean, left?

32:29.291 --> 32:31.041
When you go there, ask them.
They will guide you.

32:31.125 --> 32:32.000
It's pretty close from there.

32:37.791 --> 32:38.625
Alright then.

32:38.916 --> 32:39.750
Thanks.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.791
-Convey my regards to Dad.
-Okay.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.541
-Jaggu!
-Yes.

33:02.166 --> 33:06.291
S. GIRIDHARAN B.E.,
P. BHUVANESHWARI M.SC, PH,D.

33:18.625 --> 33:23.291
CHOLAN WEDDING HALL

34:10.583 --> 34:13.250
Sister, hold this…
keep it in the bride's room.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.708
-Keep it safely.
-Yes.

34:20.750 --> 34:22.916
-Aishwarya, leave it on the stage.
-Okay.

34:35.666 --> 34:36.666
Hey, Latha!

34:37.041 --> 34:37.958
Brother!

34:38.208 --> 34:40.583
-How are you?
-I am fine. How are you?

34:41.333 --> 34:42.625
You're unrecognizable.

34:42.875 --> 34:43.916
All grown up.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.250
It's been so many
years since you saw me,

34:46.333 --> 34:47.750
how can I still look like a teenager?

34:47.833 --> 34:50.500
Why are you being so formal?
You're inviting trouble.

34:50.958 --> 34:51.916
That's because

34:52.333 --> 34:53.708
it's been so many years since we met.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.375
It will ease out in a few minutes
as we talk.

34:55.750 --> 34:58.208
Where are your wife and daughter?
They haven't come?

34:58.375 --> 34:59.791
-You've come alone or what?
-Yes.

34:59.875 --> 35:01.916
Jhanvi's exams are going on.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.375
That's why even
she couldn't come.

35:04.041 --> 35:06.875
I had to come.
Otherwise, you know what will happen.

35:07.333 --> 35:08.291
I know… I know…

35:08.791 --> 35:11.458
Poor thing, she's been waiting
for you since evening.

35:20.625 --> 35:22.083
Okay, tell me, how are you?

35:25.875 --> 35:26.791
I am just existing.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.291
As you can see.

35:30.833 --> 35:31.750
How is your husband?

35:33.666 --> 35:34.500
He is there…

35:36.000 --> 35:39.041
He doesn't go to work
nor does he come home.

35:40.125 --> 35:41.041
Liquor!

35:42.166 --> 35:43.708
Now he has started
drinking in the morning.

35:44.958 --> 35:46.625
If we question him,
he will give some lame excuse,

35:47.375 --> 35:48.291
which will make me laugh.

35:49.208 --> 35:50.708
He will say he's starting a new business.

35:51.208 --> 35:53.208
Then suddenly he will jump into politics.

35:53.833 --> 35:55.333
Unfortunately,
nothing productive has happened.

35:59.875 --> 36:02.833
I should have just married you.

36:04.166 --> 36:05.166
Everyone wanted me to.

36:06.125 --> 36:07.083
My father was worried

36:08.000 --> 36:12.416
about how I would manage in Chennai
and refused the proposal.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.416
But just look at me now,

36:15.333 --> 36:16.416
I am very much here,

36:17.375 --> 36:18.666
right in front of everyone,

36:19.541 --> 36:20.875
but no one notices me.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.583
Oh, God! I am such an idiot!

36:31.000 --> 36:33.666
You are here for the wedding
and I am pouring out my sorrow to you.

36:33.750 --> 36:34.708
Sorry, brother!

36:35.083 --> 36:36.041
Don't get me wrong.

36:36.625 --> 36:37.500
I am going to scold you now!

36:37.583 --> 36:38.791
What do you mean by "your" problems?

36:40.041 --> 36:41.791
Alright then, you're going
to stay put, right?

36:41.875 --> 36:44.416
I left all the work I was doing
and came as soon as I saw you.

36:44.958 --> 36:46.500
-Do you want tea or coffee?
-No…

36:46.791 --> 36:48.333
-Cold drinks?
-No…

36:48.416 --> 36:51.000
You will be here, right?
If you need anything call me, okay?

36:51.333 --> 36:52.166
See you.

37:17.125 --> 37:17.958
Who is this?

37:18.500 --> 37:19.916
Guess who it is?

37:20.541 --> 37:22.833
Oh, no! I spoke.
Now you'll know!

37:23.666 --> 37:25.166
I really don't know.

37:25.916 --> 37:26.833
Shall I give you a clue?

37:28.416 --> 37:30.875
My hometown is Needamangalam.

37:33.375 --> 37:34.375
Can't guess?

37:35.291 --> 37:36.625
Okay! Second clue.

37:37.583 --> 37:40.416
I am related to you
through your mother.

37:41.583 --> 37:42.458
Still, you can't guess?

37:43.166 --> 37:44.000
Okay.

37:45.375 --> 37:46.500
This is the last clue.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.958
In the summer holidays of '94,

37:50.041 --> 37:53.416
I spent the entire month
at your home in Thanjavur.

37:53.583 --> 37:55.000
Now you will definitely remember.

37:59.458 --> 38:00.750
Voilà!

38:01.083 --> 38:03.041
What? You still couldn't guess, brother?

38:09.125 --> 38:10.166
At least now do you
recognize me or not?

38:11.000 --> 38:14.166
Yes, I do. How are you?

38:14.416 --> 38:15.416
Thank God.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.041
I was scared you would
say you don't know me.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.291
In that case, I would have
just walked away.

38:18.791 --> 38:20.541
Why are you being
so formal all of a sudden?

38:21.333 --> 38:22.208
When did you come?

38:23.708 --> 38:25.833
Just now, about 15 minutes ago.

38:26.083 --> 38:26.958
Is that so?

38:27.250 --> 38:30.083
There was a black flag protest
at the collectorate's office.

38:30.333 --> 38:33.166
I finished that and was waiting for you
at the entrance.

38:33.541 --> 38:36.791
I was waiting to give you a surprise,

38:36.875 --> 38:38.833
-but you escaped.
-Sorry, I didn't notice.

38:40.041 --> 38:42.250
When did you get here?

38:42.500 --> 38:44.250
What do you mean by when?
I stay here.

38:44.541 --> 38:46.375
For the past three days,
the wedding preparations have piled up.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.208
Our uncle was managing it all alone.

38:48.458 --> 38:50.166
I couldn't just ignore that, right?

38:50.416 --> 38:51.875
That’s why I left the shop
in my wife’s care

38:51.958 --> 38:52.958
and stayed here.

38:53.125 --> 38:55.541
They’ve given me a separate room.
An AC room.

38:57.041 --> 38:58.333
Look, the moron is here.

38:59.083 --> 38:59.916
Hello, brother!

39:00.583 --> 39:01.458
Do you have anything hot?

39:03.375 --> 39:04.250
Hot?

39:08.833 --> 39:10.541
There's hot tomato juice.
Shall I give it to you?

39:10.958 --> 39:11.916
Stop teasing.

39:12.125 --> 39:12.958
<i>Athaan!</i>

39:13.041 --> 39:14.291
The bride's brother.
His father is her dad's elder brother.

39:14.416 --> 39:16.458
He is Ekambaram, the cook.
Catering service.

39:16.625 --> 39:18.083
He will get angry if I don't
introduce him in English.

39:18.541 --> 39:19.791
Did he call me a moron?

39:19.875 --> 39:21.208
He was the cook at my wedding as well!

39:22.250 --> 39:23.416
Well, is there anything hot?

39:23.666 --> 39:24.583
Not for me, for <i>Athaan!</i>

39:25.291 --> 39:26.291
You can eat sweets, right?

39:26.750 --> 39:28.541
Yes, I can,
but I don't want anything.

39:28.625 --> 39:29.458
Oh! Just wait, <i>Athaan!</i>

39:29.916 --> 39:30.750
What sweet do you have?

39:31.125 --> 39:32.916
I won't tell you.
Will you have it only if I tell you?

39:33.041 --> 39:34.041
What a bully!

39:34.625 --> 39:36.625
Shall I tell him
what you did at your wedding?

39:36.791 --> 39:38.875
Let's not get started.
Just bring what you have, go.

39:38.958 --> 39:40.916
Brother, I will get you
both sweets and savories,

39:41.000 --> 39:42.416
eat and let me know how it is.

39:42.791 --> 39:44.875
Later, I will come and tell you
what this guy did at his wedding.

39:44.958 --> 39:45.958
-Go, now!
-Just wait.

39:46.375 --> 39:47.208
Be right back!

39:59.958 --> 40:00.833
Where is the restroom?

40:01.208 --> 40:02.208
To piss or poop?

40:05.541 --> 40:07.666
Because they have
Indian toilets downstairs.

40:08.208 --> 40:10.250
If it's to poop, it will be difficult
to remove your pants and sit.

40:10.583 --> 40:11.916
If it's to piss,
downstairs is fine.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.541
But to poop you can go upstairs,
it's superb and will be clean.

40:14.625 --> 40:15.708
So don't feel shy to tell me.

40:16.458 --> 40:17.333
No, really.

40:17.625 --> 40:19.166
-I just want to piss.
-Promise?

40:24.750 --> 40:25.583
Is it this way?

40:25.666 --> 40:28.041
Once you reach the washbasin,
it's just next to it.

40:28.958 --> 40:30.000
Why do you need this?
Give it to me.

40:40.458 --> 40:41.291
No,

40:41.541 --> 40:42.541
I'll ask someone and go, no problem.

40:43.583 --> 40:45.000
What if you say piss and go to poop?

40:45.125 --> 40:46.375
Who are you trying to fool?

40:48.000 --> 40:49.333
Just kidding, <i>Athaan!</i>

40:49.500 --> 40:51.625
I didn't pee since I was waiting for you.

40:51.708 --> 40:52.583
Even I have held it in for long.

40:52.666 --> 40:53.541
Come, let's go together.

40:53.791 --> 40:54.666
It's been so long.

41:05.958 --> 41:06.791
<i>Athaan!</i>

41:07.083 --> 41:08.583
I think you've forgotten.

41:12.750 --> 41:13.583
<i>Athaan?</i>

41:13.875 --> 41:14.708
<i>Athaan!</i>

41:16.791 --> 41:19.375
Oh! Yes! I remember now.

41:19.583 --> 41:21.125
You won't speak
while you're in the toilet.

41:21.416 --> 41:23.458
Germs will get inside our mouth
and we will get a

41:23.750 --> 41:24.791
throat infection.
You told this to us back then,

41:24.875 --> 41:25.875
at the Kumaran Cinema Theater.

41:26.208 --> 41:28.041
Okay, you don't need to talk,
just listen to me.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.583
Those days we used to have a
pissing competition, do you remember?

41:31.875 --> 41:33.333
You always won!

41:33.416 --> 41:35.041
We were just small kids back then.

41:35.333 --> 41:36.875
You used to piss
with such force,

41:36.958 --> 41:39.125
and form A, B, C
on the compound wall and show off!

41:44.750 --> 41:46.250
-Hello!
<i>-Hello!</i>

41:46.333 --> 41:47.416
<i>Good evening, brother!</i>

41:47.583 --> 41:49.250
Have you arrived?
Where are you?

41:51.333 --> 41:54.541
Look to your left
and come straight,

41:54.708 --> 41:56.166
you will find the kitchen.
Just drop it off there.

41:56.250 --> 41:57.333
<i>-I can't hear you properly.</i>
-What?

41:57.416 --> 41:59.333
<i>-It's echoing.</i>
-Echoing, is it?

41:59.666 --> 42:00.583
Hold on.

42:01.875 --> 42:02.708
Can you hear me now?

42:02.791 --> 42:05.458
<i>I can hear you very clearly now.</i>
<i>Were you in the toilet?</i>

42:05.541 --> 42:07.041
Yes, I was in the restroom.

42:07.125 --> 42:08.000
<i>Be careful with your phone.</i>

42:08.083 --> 42:09.500
-You're right.
<i>-It will fall inside the toilet.</i>

42:09.583 --> 42:10.958
That's exactly how I lost a phone…

42:11.708 --> 42:14.000
right in front of my eyes.
Before I could grab it,

42:14.083 --> 42:15.541
-the phone fell inside.
<i>-Is that so?</i>

42:15.625 --> 42:17.166
I was not concerned
about losing the phone,

42:17.458 --> 42:19.791
just the thought of getting another
SIM card from Seena Maana…

42:19.875 --> 42:21.833
-I was cursing myself for pissing!
<i>-That's right!</i>

42:24.833 --> 42:26.500
He should've come by now.

42:26.708 --> 42:29.208
I had asked Santhanam's son
to wait at the bus stand.

42:29.291 --> 42:31.333
I am trying to call him,
but it's not going through.

42:32.208 --> 42:33.166
What happened…

42:33.250 --> 42:34.125
Uncle!

42:35.041 --> 42:35.916
Hey!

42:36.666 --> 42:38.041
You've arrived!

42:38.208 --> 42:40.291
I've been looking for you everywhere.
You're coming from this side?

42:40.375 --> 42:42.416
I had gone to the restroom.
All fine with you, uncle?

42:42.500 --> 42:43.416
Of course, I am fine.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.458
I have my hometown,
I have water, I have land.

42:45.541 --> 42:46.458
And the tractor!

42:49.583 --> 42:51.083
I have no issues,
I am doing great!

42:51.375 --> 42:52.291
Mom, Dad?

42:52.416 --> 42:55.125
They are all fine.
They send their regards to you.

42:55.208 --> 42:56.333
You should have brought them.

42:56.750 --> 42:58.125
You know about my father…

42:58.291 --> 42:59.375
How will he come?

42:59.791 --> 43:00.750
Okay, listen…

43:00.833 --> 43:03.791
Those four people who you detest
are seated here

43:04.583 --> 43:07.083
and are behaving
as if they worked hard, earned,

43:07.208 --> 43:10.041
and achieved all this wealth.

43:10.291 --> 43:13.416
Wearing expensive silk clothes
and showing off!

43:13.708 --> 43:15.958
-Sold their souls for wealth!
-Forget it, uncle!

43:16.666 --> 43:17.583
Okay… okay… okay…

43:19.000 --> 43:19.833
Then…

43:23.333 --> 43:24.375
Behaving like a child.

43:24.833 --> 43:27.125
-Brother! That's my slipper.
-Yours, is it?

43:29.208 --> 43:30.375
Wait till you remove your slipper.

43:32.583 --> 43:34.250
Wait, I can't find my slipper,
I will call back after I find it.

43:34.916 --> 43:36.250
My sister Valliamma's son.

43:36.708 --> 43:37.541
Hello!

43:38.416 --> 43:39.250
-You may continue…
-Yes.

43:39.583 --> 43:41.333
-Brother, come sit.
-Sit, uncle.

43:44.250 --> 43:45.083
<i>Asoka halva!</i>

43:46.041 --> 43:46.916
Eat, it will be amazing.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.416
It will be superb, eat it!

43:49.833 --> 43:51.000
Eat! Eat!

43:53.833 --> 43:54.666
He…

43:57.250 --> 43:58.208
That… that… guy who was here…

43:58.583 --> 44:00.708
-That guy…
-Try this Brinjal fritter, it's fantastic.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.708
-Have it.
-Eat it and tell me how it is.

44:03.000 --> 44:03.875
It's nice.

44:06.125 --> 44:07.833
Uncle, you just kicked
his slippers, right?

44:07.916 --> 44:10.291
Yes, yes… If he comes now,

44:10.375 --> 44:12.291
there won't be anything left for us,
he will finish everything.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.458
We should finish it off before he comes.

44:15.166 --> 44:16.041
Not about that, uncle…

44:16.458 --> 44:18.333
-Who is that…
-Any leftovers for me?

44:18.583 --> 44:19.958
-Have you finished everything?
-Come… come…

44:20.041 --> 44:22.166
There's lots of it. We saved it for you.

44:22.291 --> 44:23.458
Look at all the leftovers.

44:27.333 --> 44:28.916
Brother, have you come alone?

44:29.375 --> 44:30.500
Haven't you brought
anyone else from home?

44:30.583 --> 44:31.541
Good question, ask him!

44:31.875 --> 44:33.250
He could have brought everyone.

44:33.625 --> 44:36.250
He's come as though he's on a solitary
pilgrimage to Kashi and Rameswaram.

44:36.791 --> 44:38.291
If they had come
and blessed the bride and groom,

44:38.375 --> 44:39.250
it would've been lovely.

44:39.708 --> 44:40.625
It would've been nice.

44:41.083 --> 44:43.791
I never said no!
Will my father ever listen to me?

44:44.000 --> 44:45.083
What's the big deal now?

44:45.250 --> 44:46.458
Earlier, he was a teacher,

44:46.791 --> 44:48.500
so he used to always get dressed,
top to toe in white,

44:48.583 --> 44:50.125
and ride off on his cycle,

44:50.375 --> 44:51.291
saying he was going to school,

44:51.375 --> 44:53.875
and correcting the answer papers,
even on Sundays.

44:53.958 --> 44:56.625
What now? Has he retired
and is staring at the roof

44:56.875 --> 44:57.875
or is he going on walks?

44:58.333 --> 45:00.958
-He can come and do that here.
-You're right.

45:01.375 --> 45:03.708
I thought the same, just hang on.

45:06.416 --> 45:08.208
Hello, Dad!

45:08.875 --> 45:09.875
Yes, I reached.

45:10.666 --> 45:11.541
Here…

45:12.208 --> 45:14.375
Sokku uncle wanted
to say something to you,

45:14.708 --> 45:15.541
just hold.

45:15.708 --> 45:17.375
No, no, he's right next to me, just wait.

45:17.666 --> 45:18.541
Ask him.

45:18.625 --> 45:20.583
You asked me this three
times in two minutes. Here.

45:21.166 --> 45:22.125
Ask him, uncle.

45:22.375 --> 45:24.291
Ask him… Talk to him, uncle.

45:25.041 --> 45:26.000
Be bold.

45:29.916 --> 45:30.791
<i>Brother-in-law.</i>

45:30.875 --> 45:32.250
-Hello, brother-in-law!
<i>-Hello, Sokkalingam.</i>

45:33.666 --> 45:34.666
Are you doing fine?

45:35.083 --> 45:36.041
I am fine.

45:36.791 --> 45:37.625
How are you?

45:37.833 --> 45:39.291
I am fine, brother-in-law.

45:43.083 --> 45:44.750
Everyone's fine at home, <i>Athaan?</i>

45:45.166 --> 45:47.208
How's sister Valliamma?

45:47.500 --> 45:48.541
She's fine.

45:48.791 --> 45:51.291
Brother-in-law, you not being here
is the only disappointment.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.375
I couldn't make it,
I have some work here.

45:54.458 --> 45:55.500
What is this, brother-in-law? Earlier,

45:55.583 --> 45:59.750
because of the school, academics,
and the children you were not available.

46:00.583 --> 46:02.666
Now you could have come.

46:02.750 --> 46:05.500
The doctors are saying if I travel,
my blood pressure will go up.

46:05.875 --> 46:07.166
What do you expect me to do?

46:07.291 --> 46:10.750
Whenever you get time, come
and visit our hometown often.

46:11.041 --> 46:13.958
Spend some time with all
of us, enjoy yourself,

46:14.166 --> 46:17.291
and just drink the water from
our river, you will heal, brother-in-law.

46:17.583 --> 46:19.333
Then neither salt nor
sugar will be a bother,

46:19.583 --> 46:21.416
you will feel rejuvenated,
brother-in-law.

46:21.500 --> 46:23.625
<i>You're the most important</i>
<i>person to all of us.</i>

46:24.166 --> 46:26.375
If you had been at
the forefront conducting everything…

46:27.083 --> 46:28.000
I am so sorry.

46:28.916 --> 46:30.250
I will definitely come next time.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
I will come to see you at least.

46:32.083 --> 46:34.375
Brother-in-law, I just want
to say one thing,

46:35.208 --> 46:38.666
are we ever
going to be born together again?

46:41.000 --> 46:41.916
<i>That's why, brother-in-law.</i>

46:45.541 --> 46:47.375
Everything you said
and asked is correct.

46:48.666 --> 46:49.500
It's wrong,

46:50.208 --> 46:51.208
I should've come.

46:51.708 --> 46:55.750
No, no, no, brother-in-law.
I will come and see you.

46:55.833 --> 46:57.500
I will come to Madras and see you.

46:58.041 --> 46:59.125
Why take the trouble?

46:59.833 --> 47:00.750
I will come.

47:00.833 --> 47:03.041
Brother-in-law, it's no trouble. Nowadays,

47:03.125 --> 47:05.750
<i>the buses are so comfortable,</i>
<i>we can even sleep and come.</i>

47:05.833 --> 47:07.125
They are now coming
till our hometown, brother-in-law.

47:07.416 --> 47:09.833
If I board that, I am going
to come comfortably and land there.

47:10.208 --> 47:12.541
Okay, you come.

47:13.291 --> 47:14.583
Now go take care
of the wedding work.

47:14.791 --> 47:15.875
I'll talk later.

47:15.958 --> 47:19.000
Okay, brother-in-law. Sure, sure.
Take care.

47:24.375 --> 47:25.333
Hello.

47:27.041 --> 47:28.208
You talk.

47:28.958 --> 47:30.166
Just check if Dad's still on the line.

47:30.708 --> 47:31.583
Dad,

47:32.583 --> 47:34.291
-I'll call later.
-Okay.

47:53.333 --> 47:55.666
<i>Athaan… Athaan…</i>
How many times…

47:56.333 --> 47:57.333
This is different, <i>Athaan.</i>

48:05.666 --> 48:07.208
What's happening,
you guys are using sign language?

48:08.041 --> 48:09.708
You kicked my slipper,
so I won't tell you.

48:11.041 --> 48:14.291
It's not fair for a warrior
to pull a fight, while one's eating.

48:15.333 --> 48:17.083
Listen, I am no longer
a young boy and,

48:17.166 --> 48:18.416
you've grown old, watch out.

48:18.500 --> 48:20.541
Old, my foot!

48:21.166 --> 48:23.000
I will break your hand
and put a cast on it, old man!

48:23.125 --> 48:25.083
You're going to break my hand
and put it in a cast?

48:25.250 --> 48:27.291
Do you even know how
to hold it and piss properly?

48:27.375 --> 48:28.708
Yuck, so disgusting!
How can you talk,

48:28.791 --> 48:29.833
so indecently in front of my <i>Athaan?</i>

48:29.916 --> 48:31.541
Hey! This seems indecent to you?

48:31.625 --> 48:33.083
Shall I tell him
what you did at your wedding?

48:33.166 --> 48:35.500
Not necessary! Go check, it seems
a lizard has fallen into the <i>payasam!</i>

48:35.583 --> 48:37.208
-It will take some time, is it okay?
-Cooker! Cooker!

48:37.291 --> 48:38.750
Cooker, just keep quiet,
listen to me, don't! Cooker!

48:38.833 --> 48:40.625
Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!

48:40.708 --> 48:41.916
-The Lord will destroy your eyes!
-Hey,

48:42.333 --> 48:43.250
why are you shouting like this?

48:43.333 --> 48:45.333
I am whispering into his ears,
how will he be able to hear?

48:45.416 --> 48:46.416
I am screaming cause
he shouldn't hear…

48:46.500 --> 48:48.625
-Oh, Lord!
-Okay, you scream all you want.

48:48.750 --> 48:49.708
Let's see who wins, you or me.

48:49.791 --> 48:51.083
Brother… brother…
Please listen to me, brother.

48:51.166 --> 48:53.708
I will get you four wedding
orders where 2000 people will eat.

48:54.375 --> 48:55.333
Please spare me.

48:56.416 --> 48:57.708
I will tell you later
when he's not there.

48:57.791 --> 48:58.625
Okay.

48:58.708 --> 49:00.541
Your Honor! The judgment has
been given, let go of my hands.

49:00.625 --> 49:03.666
Okay, both of you were talking in sign
language, tell me what that was, and go.

49:04.041 --> 49:07.041
Nothing much, uncle,
he has to board the bus tonight.

49:08.625 --> 49:09.541
How do you know?

49:11.041 --> 49:13.166
Chinna uncle has given
me the responsibility.

49:13.916 --> 49:15.291
If you permit me,

49:15.583 --> 49:17.500
we'll see the bride and groom and
I'll get him to board the bus on time.

49:18.916 --> 49:20.000
What is this?

49:20.708 --> 49:23.208
Uncle, now don't start again.

49:23.458 --> 49:25.166
You have come
after so many years,

49:25.625 --> 49:27.791
stay with us just for tonight.

49:28.166 --> 49:30.000
The wedding is taking place
in the morning around four to six.

49:30.208 --> 49:33.125
Once the rituals are over
you can leave by the next bus.

49:33.208 --> 49:34.291
Shall I book the ticket
for the 10:00 a.m. bus, <i>Athaan?</i>

49:36.583 --> 49:39.833
Let's talk about this later. First,
let me go give the gift and come.

49:39.916 --> 49:40.750
-You'll say this,
-Okay?

49:40.833 --> 49:41.791
but you'll board the bus and leave.

49:41.875 --> 49:42.708
Just like your father.

49:46.916 --> 49:48.375
Fine. At least you came.

49:52.208 --> 49:53.916
-I'll come back and speak to you.
-Okay.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.083
Do we have time to catch the bus?

49:58.791 --> 50:00.625
We have enough time, relax.

50:02.541 --> 50:04.833
Thank you! Thanks!

50:04.916 --> 50:06.416
-Auntie, please eat and go.
-Thank you.

50:06.708 --> 50:07.583
Hello, sir.

50:08.375 --> 50:09.291
Thank you.

50:10.625 --> 50:12.291
Congratulations! I'll take your leave now.

50:12.791 --> 50:14.541
-Brother…
-Bhuvana, how are you?

50:14.916 --> 50:17.041
I can't believe it! You came!

50:17.125 --> 50:18.166
I finally made it, right?

50:18.833 --> 50:21.833
Look at how stunned your sister is!

50:22.250 --> 50:23.583
You never came when so
many people called you,

50:23.666 --> 50:24.583
but here you are for me.

50:24.666 --> 50:25.833
Are they and you the same?

50:26.875 --> 50:29.250
Thanks, brother…
Thanks, brother! I just knew!

50:30.541 --> 50:32.875
This is the shirt you sent.
Is it looking nice?

50:33.125 --> 50:35.208
-It's looking superb! Did you like it?
-A lot!

50:35.291 --> 50:36.375
It's exactly like the ones I wear.

50:37.875 --> 50:39.750
-My brother.
-Sir.

50:40.166 --> 50:41.625
-How are you, sir?
-I am fine.

50:41.708 --> 50:42.875
Sir, I hadn't seen you, but,

50:43.041 --> 50:44.625
I know everything about you.

50:44.750 --> 50:46.250
She would have spoken
about it 108 times at least.

50:46.333 --> 50:47.458
I literally know it by heart.

50:47.583 --> 50:49.333
She only talks about you
over the phone.

50:49.541 --> 50:52.708
Sir, even our romantic
conversations are about you.

50:53.041 --> 50:54.000
At one point,

50:54.541 --> 50:56.458
I even thought of marrying you.
Sorry, sir!

50:57.208 --> 51:00.000
Idiot! Did you not have
any other topic to talk about?

51:00.083 --> 51:02.625
Sir, all the topics she
talks about are boring.

51:02.875 --> 51:04.541
By those standards,
stories about you are far better.

51:05.875 --> 51:08.375
That's because Bhuvana
and I grew up together.

51:08.458 --> 51:09.875
Sir… sir… I know it all.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.750
How you grew up together,
how you babysat her,

51:11.833 --> 51:13.291
how you cried when
she got chicken pox.

51:13.375 --> 51:14.583
How you plucked
gooseberries for her.

51:14.666 --> 51:16.541
How you went to school on
the cycle together. Am I correct, sir?

51:16.958 --> 51:17.916
I know everything, sir.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.083
Please don't narrate it again, sir.

51:19.166 --> 51:20.375
I'll marry your sister!

51:21.583 --> 51:22.916
Thanks a lot for sparing me.

51:24.208 --> 51:25.375
-Thank you, sir.
-Congratulations.

51:25.458 --> 51:26.916
-Thank you so much, sir.
-Wish you a very happy married life.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.375
-Thank you so much, sir.
-Oh, wow!

51:28.500 --> 51:29.875
You know
how to do all this, is it?

51:30.375 --> 51:31.208
Not bad!

51:31.833 --> 51:34.208
Well, what have you got for me?

51:35.291 --> 51:38.333
What you like, what I like, all of it.

51:40.291 --> 51:41.791
Hey, what are you doing?

51:42.541 --> 51:44.708
Hey, the queue is really long.

51:45.541 --> 51:47.291
-See it later.
-No!

51:47.458 --> 51:50.125
My brother has got this,
especially for me. Should I not see it?

51:50.208 --> 51:51.250
What's more important than that?

51:51.333 --> 51:54.125
There's nothing that special
in there, listen to me, Bhuvana.

51:54.208 --> 51:55.166
Then how special is it?

51:55.500 --> 51:58.583
Let it be anything.
You got it for me, right?

52:01.250 --> 52:03.958
Hey. Everyone's waiting in the queue.

52:05.083 --> 52:06.000
It's okay, wait.

52:06.250 --> 52:08.083
You never came at anyone's behest
but you came for me, right?

52:09.125 --> 52:09.958
Then wait.

52:10.875 --> 52:11.791
Hold this.

52:15.625 --> 52:16.458
Give it… give it…

52:19.125 --> 52:19.958
Careful!

52:23.083 --> 52:24.333
What is this? There are so many things!

52:24.791 --> 52:26.375
-Everything is for you.
-Keep it safely.

52:26.708 --> 52:27.541
Hold this.

52:34.208 --> 52:36.875
Bhuvana, open it quickly.
Just tear it open.

52:37.166 --> 52:38.958
I need the wrapper,
I will keep it safely.

52:42.208 --> 52:43.125
Careful!

52:45.375 --> 52:47.208
Girl, are you going
to unwrap everything?

52:47.500 --> 52:49.416
Yes, I am going to unwrap
every single one and see it.

52:49.666 --> 52:51.041
What are you, a tailgate?

52:51.208 --> 52:52.041
His bodyguard?

52:52.500 --> 52:53.333
Oh, God!

52:53.583 --> 52:55.291
He didn't know the way
to the stage, so I accompanied him.

52:55.875 --> 52:57.416
Look, at least I am
helpful in holding the box.

52:58.166 --> 53:00.125
Hey, do you know
who this "sir" is?

53:00.416 --> 53:03.083
Yes, yes, I know!
He's the one who received me first.

53:03.666 --> 53:05.208
That I know, I am not talking about that.

53:06.625 --> 53:08.291
This "sir" by relation,
is eligible to marry me.

53:08.541 --> 53:10.166
What are you talking
about when he's right there?

53:10.416 --> 53:11.250
Won't you keep quiet?

53:11.541 --> 53:12.625
Hey! How dare you threaten me?

53:12.708 --> 53:14.041
If I give you one punch, you
will go flying and land at home!

53:14.166 --> 53:15.083
Beware!

53:38.125 --> 53:39.500
Shall I wear all
of this right now?

53:40.333 --> 53:41.291
I would love to do so.

53:41.708 --> 53:43.833
My brother bought
all this for me,

53:44.166 --> 53:45.750
so I'll pose with it, okay?

53:47.875 --> 53:49.208
Wear it, darling, it's all for you.

53:50.666 --> 53:51.583
You put it on me.

53:58.333 --> 54:00.083
I will string the gold coin,
to the wedding chain, tomorrow.

54:00.375 --> 54:01.958
First, the bangles.

54:08.958 --> 54:12.125
Wow! What a fantastic start!
Baby shower?

54:12.208 --> 54:13.375
Yes! Exactly!

54:14.083 --> 54:15.291
-Is it hurting?
-No.

54:19.625 --> 54:20.708
No, not that.

54:21.458 --> 54:22.291
Take that one.

54:36.291 --> 54:37.416
Give that, I'll put it on.

54:44.583 --> 54:45.416
It's nice.

54:46.458 --> 54:47.416
Now take that.

56:49.750 --> 56:51.125
-Careful.
-You saw that!

56:51.958 --> 56:53.458
Did I not say that
I would marry him?

56:54.208 --> 56:55.833
-You've started again. I am leaving now.
-Sir.

56:56.541 --> 56:58.583
-Where are you going?
-Doesn't your brother have to eat?

56:58.875 --> 57:01.166
If we go late, they'll say all the
sweets and the special dishes are over.

57:01.500 --> 57:03.125
Only if we go now we'll get a place,
there's a huge crowd.

57:03.625 --> 57:04.958
Oh, that's good.

57:05.625 --> 57:07.833
Okay, go. We'll be right behind you,
don't start eating,

57:07.958 --> 57:09.250
wait for us.

57:10.375 --> 57:11.208
Wipe your eyes.

57:21.833 --> 57:22.791
You come here.

57:23.041 --> 57:23.958
Where are you going?

57:24.291 --> 57:26.416
Tell him not to eat, I'll be right there.

57:26.500 --> 57:27.958
It's been so many
years since we saw him.

57:28.333 --> 57:29.708
Uncle! Auntie!

57:29.875 --> 57:31.333
-Hello, Arul, how are you?
-I am fine.

57:31.416 --> 57:32.291
How are you, Arul?

57:32.416 --> 57:33.916
So happy you came.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.833
I thought you would
disappoint us like always.

57:35.916 --> 57:36.833
Come on, uncle!

57:38.083 --> 57:38.958
-Uncle,
-Tell me.

57:39.041 --> 57:41.666
there was this person standing
next to me, do you know who that is?

57:41.750 --> 57:43.041
Who? I didn't notice.

57:43.875 --> 57:45.875
Hey, son! He's asking me
if I know who someone is.

57:45.958 --> 57:47.875
Just find out who that is and tell him.

57:48.541 --> 57:50.041
Arul, I am going up.

57:50.125 --> 57:51.583
-You must eat and then leave, okay?
-Yes.

57:51.666 --> 57:53.291
-Come, let's go.
-Eat and go.

57:53.916 --> 57:55.416
Who are you asking about, <i>Athaan?</i>

57:56.625 --> 57:57.583
You saw them here?

57:58.708 --> 57:59.625
What did they look like?

58:00.000 --> 58:00.916
Short or tall?

58:01.333 --> 58:02.541
Fat or thin or hefty?

58:02.958 --> 58:04.625
Dark or fair or wheatish like me?

58:06.333 --> 58:07.375
Man or woman?

58:08.666 --> 58:10.208
If you give the specifics,
we can catch them.

58:11.625 --> 58:13.000
It's alright, forget it.

58:13.375 --> 58:14.333
How can we just forget it?

58:14.625 --> 58:17.000
There is no one I don't know in this
hall and no one who doesn't know me.

58:18.333 --> 58:19.208
Shall I ask them
to close the main door?

58:21.125 --> 58:22.791
I am hungry, shall we eat?

58:23.083 --> 58:23.958
Even you?

58:24.500 --> 58:25.416
Oh, God! Come.

58:28.416 --> 58:30.375
Can I charge my phone somewhere?

58:30.541 --> 58:31.416
There is just ten percent battery left.

58:33.666 --> 58:34.541
Kanagarasu.

58:34.625 --> 58:35.708
-Kanagarasu, come here!
-Yes?

58:36.916 --> 58:38.500
Put it on charge
somewhere safe. Give it…

58:39.375 --> 58:40.291
Switch it off.

58:44.041 --> 58:45.208
Where will you charge it? Careful.

58:45.291 --> 58:47.458
There is a police station nearby,
shall I put it there?

58:47.791 --> 58:50.250
See, I am working
for him as his boss.

58:50.333 --> 58:51.958
If I ask him again, I will lose
the little respect I have left.

58:57.375 --> 58:58.583
Oh, no!

58:59.375 --> 59:00.875
Uncle! Uncle!

59:03.166 --> 59:04.708
Just shut up and eat.

59:06.333 --> 59:08.166
-What happened, uncle?
-Nothing, son.

59:08.250 --> 59:09.250
Let's eat.

59:31.458 --> 59:32.375
I'll leave, uncle.

59:32.750 --> 59:34.500
What nonsense!
Why should you leave?

59:34.833 --> 59:36.666
It's uncle's order,
you can only leave after you eat.

59:39.250 --> 59:41.250
Don't you have any idea
when to talk about what?

59:42.750 --> 59:44.250
<i>Athaan,</i> look here.

59:44.416 --> 59:47.541
There is <i>poli, suzhiyam,</i>
<i>paal kozhukattai, ada prathaman payasam,</i>

59:47.625 --> 59:48.500
look here,

59:48.625 --> 59:52.625
<i>seppankizhangu</i> roast, <i>pudalangai usili,</i>
<i>aama vada</i> with <i>poondu podi.</i>

59:52.708 --> 59:53.666
And this,
I don't even know what it is.

59:53.750 --> 59:55.541
Hey! Tell me what else is there,
only then can I eat.

59:55.625 --> 59:57.041
Okay… okay… enough.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.291
He is trying to change the
subject it seems, stupid fool!

1:00:02.750 --> 1:00:04.166
I'll do what I want.
You just keep quiet.

1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:06.333
<i>Athaan,</i> what's your phone number?

1:00:07.625 --> 1:00:08.541
Why, now?

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:11.125
When uncle told me,
I dialed it, but I forgot to save it.

1:00:11.208 --> 1:00:12.041
Tell me.

1:00:12.291 --> 1:00:15.291
-It's 9841618800.
-He's done for!

1:00:15.833 --> 1:00:16.708
Angry?

1:00:17.083 --> 1:00:18.083
Say it slowly.

1:00:18.333 --> 1:00:19.666
It sounded like you
didn't want to give it.

1:00:20.958 --> 1:00:21.833
Nine, eight.

1:00:22.166 --> 1:00:23.083
Four, one.

1:00:23.250 --> 1:00:24.208
Six, one.

1:00:24.458 --> 1:00:25.291
Eight, eight.

1:00:26.958 --> 1:00:27.833
Zero, one.

1:00:29.166 --> 1:00:30.125
I'll leave, uncle.

1:00:34.708 --> 1:00:36.000
You're wondering why I took it, right?

1:00:36.208 --> 1:00:37.916
I note down
all important numbers here as well.

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.000
I don't trust the phone.

1:00:39.125 --> 1:00:40.583
If anything goes wrong,
all the numbers get deleted.

1:00:41.291 --> 1:00:43.666
CHENNAI
ATHAAN - 9841618801

1:00:46.625 --> 1:00:47.791
You never took my number.

1:00:49.541 --> 1:00:50.375
My phone isn't here.

1:00:50.458 --> 1:00:51.416
So what if your phone isn't here?

1:00:51.625 --> 1:00:53.166
You would have a piece of paper or
a visiting card in your wallet, right?

1:00:53.250 --> 1:00:54.875
I don't have my wallet,
it's inside my bag.

1:01:03.291 --> 1:01:06.208
Oh, my! <i>Athaan</i> has a lot of money!

1:01:06.291 --> 1:01:08.333
I can ask him when in an emergency!

1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:16.166
I am writing it on the blue card, don't
lose it and then search for it later.

1:01:27.666 --> 1:01:28.916
<i>Athaan, </i>lift your bum.

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:32.541
With so much cash in it, how can you
keep your wallet in the bag?

1:01:33.708 --> 1:01:34.583
Lift it just a little.

1:01:41.500 --> 1:01:42.708
Someone's thinking about you.

1:01:43.291 --> 1:01:45.333
Who else, it must be sister,
she ought to be wondering whether you ate.

1:01:45.625 --> 1:01:48.500
No sister is thinking about him,
he's thinking about himself!

1:01:49.333 --> 1:01:51.166
For all the trouble you're causing,

1:01:51.250 --> 1:01:52.833
he's wondering whether
to ever come here again.

1:01:53.083 --> 1:01:54.041
What did I do?

1:01:54.541 --> 1:01:55.541
Is that what you're thinking, <i>Athaan?</i>

1:02:00.166 --> 1:02:01.416
Then I won't talk anymore.

1:02:01.583 --> 1:02:02.416
I will never talk.

1:02:02.833 --> 1:02:03.708
Really?

1:02:04.125 --> 1:02:05.583
I won't talk even
if you beg me to.

1:02:05.916 --> 1:02:06.833
Now you're talking.

1:02:07.125 --> 1:02:08.833
This is not talking.
This is telling.

1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:10.291
Talking and telling
are two different things.

1:02:10.375 --> 1:02:11.416
So you won't talk?

1:02:14.375 --> 1:02:15.791
You're swearing on the onion <i>pachadi!</i>

1:02:19.083 --> 1:02:21.333
So you swear
on the food you eat, is it?

1:02:22.333 --> 1:02:23.166
Okay!

1:02:23.541 --> 1:02:25.333
So, lifelong…

1:02:29.375 --> 1:02:31.375
Oh, until you finish eating
you won't talk?

1:02:31.625 --> 1:02:33.250
I imagined something else
and was so happy.

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:35.916
Even I shouldn't talk?

1:02:36.166 --> 1:02:37.458
Okay. Deal.

1:02:39.625 --> 1:02:40.708
P. BHUVANESHWARI
S. GIRIDHARAN

1:03:14.250 --> 1:03:17.041
<i>Dearest women folk!</i>

1:03:17.125 --> 1:03:18.416
<i>Welcome!</i>

1:03:18.625 --> 1:03:22.666
<i>It's the wedding day!</i>

1:03:22.958 --> 1:03:23.791
<i>The brotherhood…</i>

1:03:23.875 --> 1:03:25.666
-Enough! enough!
<i>-In unison!</i>

1:03:25.750 --> 1:03:26.958
<i>Come</i>

1:03:27.041 --> 1:03:28.000
-Eat, brother.
<i>-And bless…</i>

1:03:28.083 --> 1:03:30.041
-Did you eat?
<i>-them!</i>

1:03:30.125 --> 1:03:31.333
I will eat, you go and eat.

1:03:31.666 --> 1:03:33.833
<i>To host the feast</i>

1:03:33.916 --> 1:03:35.958
<i>The sacred day has arrived!</i>

1:03:36.041 --> 1:03:40.083
<i>All our kith and kin</i>
<i>Have started coming!</i>

1:03:40.416 --> 1:03:42.500
<i>Together, wholeheartedly</i>

1:03:42.583 --> 1:03:44.333
<i>The folks have gathered to bless</i>

1:03:44.416 --> 1:03:45.583
<i>They have gathered!</i>

1:03:45.666 --> 1:03:47.708
<i>They are good people!</i>

1:03:47.791 --> 1:03:50.416
<i>On the special banana leaf</i>

1:03:50.500 --> 1:03:52.541
<i>Like the heart that serves</i>

1:03:52.625 --> 1:03:54.666
<i>Hunger shall be satiated to the brim!</i>

1:03:54.750 --> 1:03:56.333
<i>On this delightful day!</i>

1:03:56.416 --> 1:03:59.083
<i>The legacy of hospitality</i>

1:03:59.166 --> 1:04:01.291
<i>That is Tamil Nadu's Pride</i>

1:04:01.375 --> 1:04:03.541
<i>A predominant attribute</i>

1:04:03.625 --> 1:04:06.083
<i>Will shower blessings to live!</i>

1:04:06.166 --> 1:04:08.333
<i>The </i>coconut poli<i> be served!</i>

1:04:08.416 --> 1:04:10.375
<i>The </i>therattipal<i> be served!</i>

1:04:10.458 --> 1:04:14.333
<i>The </i>suzhiyam soyaan<i> be served!</i>

1:04:14.875 --> 1:04:17.041
<i>The </i>thavala adai dosai

1:04:17.125 --> 1:04:19.291
<i>With the aromatic pepper curry</i>

1:04:19.375 --> 1:04:23.166
<i>Feast on the ideal combination</i>

1:04:26.125 --> 1:04:27.416
Son, he is asking for <i>rasam.</i>

1:04:52.916 --> 1:04:53.958
You achieved it, my son!

1:04:56.333 --> 1:04:57.500
<i>Athaan's</i> fingers are drying up, come.

1:05:00.666 --> 1:05:01.583
How much has it charged?

1:05:01.666 --> 1:05:03.750
You don't need to charge it
till you buy another phone.

1:05:04.375 --> 1:05:05.375
It's my fault that I asked you!

1:05:06.458 --> 1:05:07.291
<i>Athaan,</i>

1:05:07.375 --> 1:05:08.833
if you have to say bye
to anyone, make it fast.

1:05:08.916 --> 1:05:11.333
-I'll wait here. It's getting late.
-Not necessary, let's leave.

1:05:12.250 --> 1:05:13.541
Are you going to leave
without telling Bhuvana?

1:05:14.291 --> 1:05:15.458
She will be expecting you.

1:05:15.583 --> 1:05:17.000
Didn't she say she would eat with you?

1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:18.708
If she comes to know you're not
there at the wedding tomorrow,

1:05:18.791 --> 1:05:19.708
she will make a big scene.

1:05:20.291 --> 1:05:21.875
That's why I am saying
no to it. Come, let's go.

1:05:24.666 --> 1:05:26.541
I'll keep it. You go on.

1:05:28.833 --> 1:05:29.666
<i>Athaan,</i>

1:05:29.875 --> 1:05:30.791
I'll just get my scooter.

1:05:37.291 --> 1:05:38.125
Hello.

1:05:38.208 --> 1:05:40.833
Sorry, had put my phone on charge,
that's why I missed your call.

1:05:41.208 --> 1:05:43.166
Okay, okay.
Did everything go well?

1:05:43.541 --> 1:05:44.500
Yes, all done.

1:05:46.208 --> 1:05:48.125
We just finished
eating and came out.

1:05:48.458 --> 1:05:49.458
We?

1:05:49.541 --> 1:05:50.416
Who is this "we"?

1:05:50.791 --> 1:05:53.916
Me, Sokku uncle, and another guy.

1:05:54.375 --> 1:05:55.791
Who is this '"another guy"?

1:05:57.458 --> 1:05:59.166
That other guy is the one

1:05:59.500 --> 1:06:01.333
who took me to the stage
and for dinner.

1:06:01.833 --> 1:06:02.750
What, Arul?

1:06:02.958 --> 1:06:04.208
You have been gone for just a day

1:06:04.541 --> 1:06:07.250
-and you have changed into a native.
-Why?

1:06:07.333 --> 1:06:08.666
<i>Your dialect, the way</i>
<i>you said he "took you"!</i>

1:06:10.750 --> 1:06:12.041
Did I really sound like that?

1:06:12.750 --> 1:06:14.083
He only accompanied me.

1:06:14.708 --> 1:06:16.958
<i>-If I ask you to do something, will you?</i>
-What?

1:06:17.291 --> 1:06:19.041
Why are you desperate
to get back home?

1:06:19.375 --> 1:06:20.875
You can stay another day
and come, isn't it?

1:06:21.333 --> 1:06:22.166
Why?

1:06:22.541 --> 1:06:23.958
I don't know if you're able to notice it,

1:06:24.458 --> 1:06:25.708
but your tone
itself has changed,

1:06:26.708 --> 1:06:28.416
you sound happy.
That's why.

1:06:30.541 --> 1:06:32.541
I don't want to…
Don't confuse me.

1:06:32.750 --> 1:06:33.791
I have to leave now.

1:06:34.416 --> 1:06:35.250
We are just about to leave.

1:06:35.333 --> 1:06:36.750
That's exactly what I am saying.
Give it here.

1:06:37.208 --> 1:06:39.916
Listen, if you don't start tonight
and reach here,

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:41.708
you won't be allowed to conduct
the rituals anywhere in this area.

1:06:42.125 --> 1:06:43.541
<i>Priest, we have</i>
<i>booked an AC room for you.</i>

1:06:43.625 --> 1:06:45.041
-Okay.
<i>-If you don't come on time…</i>

1:06:45.125 --> 1:06:47.416
Who is continuously talking
in the background?

1:06:47.791 --> 1:06:49.708
More than your voice,
I can hear that noise.

1:06:49.833 --> 1:06:53.416
I told you, right, that guy who took me
around everywhere. It's him.

1:06:54.041 --> 1:06:55.416
I met him at the wedding.

1:06:56.666 --> 1:06:58.458
To be honest,
I am literally stuck with him.

1:06:59.041 --> 1:06:59.958
Who is he?

1:07:00.583 --> 1:07:02.166
That's what I told you, Hema,
I don't know.

1:07:02.416 --> 1:07:04.458
But he seems to know me well.
He knows everything.

1:07:04.875 --> 1:07:05.833
He's unbearably affectionate.

1:07:06.083 --> 1:07:07.916
Okay, can't you ask someone?

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:09.083
How can I?

1:07:09.375 --> 1:07:10.708
He's stuck to me like a magnet.

1:07:11.125 --> 1:07:12.708
With him around, how can I ask?

1:07:13.041 --> 1:07:15.375
Tell him directly that
you don't know him.

1:07:15.625 --> 1:07:17.625
If he comes to know that I don't
know him, he won't be able to digest it.

1:07:18.375 --> 1:07:20.041
If he comes to know that I pretended
to know him, that'll be it!

1:07:20.541 --> 1:07:22.166
And you want me to go
and tell him now… forget it.

1:07:22.875 --> 1:07:24.250
I've managed so far.

1:07:24.333 --> 1:07:25.333
I will leave now.

1:07:25.500 --> 1:07:26.375
It's only till then.

1:07:26.916 --> 1:07:28.208
I'll maintain the same act.

1:07:28.458 --> 1:07:30.416
Hey, that's wrong.

1:07:30.916 --> 1:07:32.208
You shouldn't cheat like this.

1:07:32.791 --> 1:07:35.291
If he finds out later he will
feel really bad. You understand?

1:07:36.958 --> 1:07:39.166
Sorry, I overheard the last part.

1:07:39.666 --> 1:07:41.458
You said you're going
to maintain something. What is that?

1:07:41.541 --> 1:07:43.083
-No, nothing…
-Who is on the line? Sister?

1:07:43.583 --> 1:07:44.500
Let me talk to her.

1:07:44.583 --> 1:07:45.625
No, she doesn't know you.

1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:46.958
<i>Why? Haven't you told her?</i>

1:07:47.041 --> 1:07:48.041
It's alright. I'll tell her.

1:07:48.250 --> 1:07:49.375
She may get angry,
that I am with you but I didn't talk.

1:07:49.458 --> 1:07:50.791
-It's getting late.
-Keep quiet, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:07:51.458 --> 1:07:53.208
<i>You address her as "baby"?</i>

1:07:54.666 --> 1:07:56.166
You used to call your Sivan temple's
elephant also "baby," right?

1:07:56.833 --> 1:07:58.166
Sister, how are you? Are you fine?

1:07:59.500 --> 1:08:02.041
<i>You don't know me.</i>
<i>You've never met me.</i>

1:08:02.250 --> 1:08:04.625
It's me who took good care
of your husband at the wedding.

1:08:05.250 --> 1:08:07.291
Get all the details about
me later from <i>Athaan.</i>

1:08:07.375 --> 1:08:09.166
-Oh.
-I've finished talking. Now, you speak.

1:08:11.416 --> 1:08:12.583
Just simply ask me if I am doing fine.

1:08:14.666 --> 1:08:16.125
Are you doing fine?

1:08:16.208 --> 1:08:17.416
I am like a brother to you.

1:08:17.666 --> 1:08:18.958
I am doing great, as always!

1:08:19.041 --> 1:08:21.291
<i>Athaan</i> is also doing fine.
He had his dinner.

1:08:21.416 --> 1:08:22.958
He'll reach for the morning coffee.

1:08:23.166 --> 1:08:24.250
<i>You could've also come.</i>

1:08:24.541 --> 1:08:26.375
I am happy that you at least sent him.

1:08:26.625 --> 1:08:27.541
It's getting late,
and <i>Athaan</i> will get angry.

1:08:27.625 --> 1:08:28.666
<i>I have to go drop him</i>
<i>at the bus stand.</i>

1:08:28.791 --> 1:08:30.791
The rest we will talk
about in person, okay? Bye.

1:08:31.291 --> 1:08:32.125
Bye!

1:08:32.916 --> 1:08:34.541
She speaks so slowly.

1:08:34.875 --> 1:08:35.708
You talk to her.

1:08:37.541 --> 1:08:38.416
Hello.

1:08:38.791 --> 1:08:41.083
Hey! Who is this?

1:08:41.791 --> 1:08:42.708
You're asking me!

1:08:43.541 --> 1:08:44.541
Did you ask him for his name?

1:08:44.791 --> 1:08:45.625
No.

1:08:46.458 --> 1:08:47.416
You should have asked him.

1:08:49.708 --> 1:08:50.625
Okay, I'll talk later.

1:08:53.500 --> 1:08:54.833
Why are you laughing?

1:08:55.958 --> 1:08:56.791
Eat.

1:08:57.875 --> 1:08:59.666
Sokku uncle, see you.

1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:01.500
Take care of your health.

1:09:04.166 --> 1:09:05.000
What is this, uncle?

1:09:05.083 --> 1:09:07.625
Because of them,
you've forgotten your hometown,

1:09:07.833 --> 1:09:09.541
distanced yourselves
from all the relations…

1:09:09.625 --> 1:09:11.333
Even this uncle…

1:09:21.833 --> 1:09:23.375
Okay, don't cry, don't cry.

1:09:25.458 --> 1:09:26.333
Okay, son,

1:09:26.583 --> 1:09:28.041
-have you taken everything?
-Yes.

1:09:28.375 --> 1:09:29.750
-Have a safe journey.
-Yes.

1:09:29.833 --> 1:09:31.291
Inform me once you reach.

1:09:31.375 --> 1:09:32.458
Okay.

1:09:32.541 --> 1:09:35.500
Hey, is it not enough that I cried,
why are you also crying?

1:09:36.041 --> 1:09:38.458
He's come now isn't it, so he
will come more often hereafter.

1:09:39.083 --> 1:09:40.875
Why are you telling me that?
Tell him.

1:09:41.250 --> 1:09:42.791
Is he standing ten miles away?

1:09:42.875 --> 1:09:44.708
He's listening
to everything you're saying.

1:09:45.166 --> 1:09:46.291
He will definitely come, have faith.

1:09:46.375 --> 1:09:47.500
Only you're saying that

1:09:47.833 --> 1:09:49.833
-he's not opening his mouth.
-Trust me. He will come.

1:09:50.125 --> 1:09:51.000
Take him and go.

1:09:52.958 --> 1:09:53.833
See you, uncle.

1:09:54.666 --> 1:09:55.500
Take care.

1:09:58.916 --> 1:10:00.291
Go, drop him safely.

1:10:04.250 --> 1:10:05.208
Don't cry.

1:10:47.083 --> 1:10:49.291
<i>O' homeland!</i>

1:10:49.625 --> 1:10:53.708
<i>What did you wait for to say?</i>

1:10:54.208 --> 1:10:56.041
<i>All for my sake?</i>

1:10:56.125 --> 1:10:58.333
<i>Like a magic hand</i>

1:10:58.833 --> 1:11:00.708
<i>You held me</i>

1:11:01.083 --> 1:11:03.625
<i>You charmed me</i>

1:11:03.916 --> 1:11:05.083
<i>Why? O' why?</i>

1:11:05.166 --> 1:11:07.625
<i>O' why did I land here?</i>

1:11:07.916 --> 1:11:12.250
<i>Within my soul arises a question</i>

1:11:12.541 --> 1:11:14.666
<i>In my turbulent heart!</i>

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.166
<i>The time of reluctant parting</i>

1:11:17.250 --> 1:11:19.750
<i>Memories of an</i>
<i>Unbearably soothing burden</i>

1:11:20.500 --> 1:11:21.958
<i>O' my homeland</i>

1:11:22.375 --> 1:11:23.583
<i>Who am I?</i>

1:11:23.666 --> 1:11:27.125
<i>Here…</i>

1:11:47.208 --> 1:11:49.791
-Hey, what happened?
-Angu uncle's tea?

1:11:50.375 --> 1:11:52.708
COUNTRY COW MILK
COUNTRY SUGAR TEA

1:11:53.333 --> 1:11:54.916
Why now? It's getting late.

1:11:55.083 --> 1:11:55.916
We have enough time, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:57.916
This tea is made out of native-breed milk,
with jaggery powder.

1:11:58.000 --> 1:11:59.000
You won't get it in Madras.

1:11:59.083 --> 1:12:00.000
Let's not…

1:12:01.083 --> 1:12:02.791
Uncle, two special teas.

1:12:08.541 --> 1:12:11.583
The sheer joy of drinking tea
after a good meal is something else!

1:12:11.666 --> 1:12:12.541
Drink, <i>Athaan!</i>

1:12:13.541 --> 1:12:14.750
It will be a sin if you don't drink!

1:12:14.833 --> 1:12:15.791
Drink and tell me how it is.

1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:19.833
-Superb! It's very nice.
-Isn't it?

1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:21.583
Drink fast, let's leave.

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.958
We will miss the bus.
I have to go to work tomorrow.

1:12:24.083 --> 1:12:25.333
I'll take care of it, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:12:25.625 --> 1:12:27.041
They won't dare to move
the bus without asking me!

1:12:51.083 --> 1:12:52.375
Just a second,
I'll ask him and come.

1:12:53.666 --> 1:12:56.291
Sir, the bus to Chennai?

1:12:56.708 --> 1:12:57.541
Chennai bus?

1:12:57.791 --> 1:12:58.875
You're coming now and inquiring.

1:12:59.166 --> 1:13:00.708
The last bus left 15 minutes ago.

1:13:05.708 --> 1:13:08.416
Sir, please call and ask them to stop
the bus. <i>Athaan</i> has to leave tonight.

1:13:10.958 --> 1:13:12.583
Can we stop the bus
for just one person?

1:13:17.333 --> 1:13:18.916
Sir, just please find out
where the bus is,

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.000
I will chase it and catch up with it.

1:13:20.458 --> 1:13:22.625
-Just ask him to drive slowly.
-On this scooter?

1:13:23.416 --> 1:13:25.291
In five minutes,
the bus will hit the highway.

1:13:25.375 --> 1:13:26.666
After that, even if you ride
on a Yamaha RX 100

1:13:26.750 --> 1:13:27.750
at full speed, you won't catch up.

1:13:29.541 --> 1:13:30.750
Sir, what other option is there?
Tell me, sir.

1:13:31.500 --> 1:13:32.458
There's only one option.

1:13:33.666 --> 1:13:36.666
Sleep, and in the morning take
the 07:30 a.m. bus to Thanjavur.

1:13:37.208 --> 1:13:39.208
And from there board
the Volvo luxury bus at 08:00 a.m.

1:13:39.583 --> 1:13:42.208
It'll drop you off at Guindy
easily between 02:00 to 02:30 p.m.

1:13:59.625 --> 1:14:01.375
Talk only if there is
another way to go,

1:14:02.250 --> 1:14:03.333
otherwise don't say anything.

1:14:06.958 --> 1:14:07.833
No, right?

1:14:11.833 --> 1:14:13.916
I've told them I'll be there at the office
for something important.

1:14:15.041 --> 1:14:17.458
What shall I tell them now?
That I missed the bus.

1:14:18.666 --> 1:14:19.583
They will laugh at me.

1:14:20.625 --> 1:14:21.958
<i>Athaan,</i> don't get tensed.

1:14:22.083 --> 1:14:23.541
If you get tense,
I won't get any ideas.

1:14:23.875 --> 1:14:25.250
You don't have to give any idea.

1:14:25.416 --> 1:14:26.875
He just told everything clearly.

1:14:29.666 --> 1:14:30.666
Let's figure out what has to be done now.

1:14:31.625 --> 1:14:32.458
Sir.

1:14:34.250 --> 1:14:37.250
Sir, is there a lodge
anywhere close by?

1:14:37.458 --> 1:14:38.333
Lodge?

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:39.875
Sir?

1:14:43.500 --> 1:14:44.625
Do you know any lodge?

1:14:46.541 --> 1:14:48.875
Hey, if you know, say you do,
or if you don't, say you don't,

1:14:48.958 --> 1:14:50.416
or at least find out
from someone and tell me.

1:14:52.166 --> 1:14:53.083
Okay, I'll find out myself.

1:14:53.166 --> 1:14:54.541
Why lodge, <i>Athaan?</i>
My house is there,

1:14:54.625 --> 1:14:56.333
-you can sleep and leave in the morning.
-I don't want all that.

1:14:57.583 --> 1:14:59.583
Can you take me to a lodge now or not?

1:15:01.375 --> 1:15:02.208
I can't, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:15:03.333 --> 1:15:04.666
Okay, I'll figure it out myself.

1:15:05.250 --> 1:15:06.416
<i>Athaan… Athaan…</i>

1:15:13.458 --> 1:15:14.916
<i>Athaan,</i> do you think this is Madras?

1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:17.083
There are just two lodges
near the bus stand.

1:15:17.750 --> 1:15:19.791
There will be cockroaches in
the toilet and bed bugs on the mattress.

1:15:20.750 --> 1:15:22.791
It will be pathetic, <i>Athaan.</i>
And you're saying you want to go there.

1:15:23.500 --> 1:15:24.500
For the cleanliness you seek,

1:15:24.583 --> 1:15:25.708
you won't even go
inside with your slippers.

1:15:25.791 --> 1:15:27.583
Let there be any insect,
I'll handle it.

1:15:27.875 --> 1:15:29.166
<i>Athaan,</i> please listen to me.

1:15:30.833 --> 1:15:32.041
Okay, come, I'll take you.

1:15:37.291 --> 1:15:38.125
Come, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:15:43.875 --> 1:15:45.791
Did I ask you for that
native-breed milk tea?

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:47.875
Did I?

1:16:01.875 --> 1:16:08.000
PANDIAN LODGE

1:16:08.083 --> 1:16:14.208
PRABHU LODGE

1:16:14.291 --> 1:16:16.583
There is one on this side and,
another on this side.

1:16:16.708 --> 1:16:17.541
Go take a look.

1:16:26.625 --> 1:16:27.750
I can manage from here.

1:16:28.833 --> 1:16:29.708
You leave.

1:16:33.208 --> 1:16:35.041
Anyway, thanks.

1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:35.875
You didn't leave?

1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:43.000
Both are okay…

1:17:45.958 --> 1:17:46.791
But no…

1:17:47.958 --> 1:17:49.833
Just a little further ahead,
there’s another lodge.

1:17:50.666 --> 1:17:51.916
But it won’t be as clean as these two.

1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:53.375
Shall we go?

1:17:57.625 --> 1:17:58.500
Shall we go home?

1:18:03.666 --> 1:18:04.708
<i>Hold me tightly, Athaan!</i>

1:18:14.833 --> 1:18:16.041
You can stop the scooter and then talk.

1:18:16.166 --> 1:18:17.041
Just a minute, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:18:17.583 --> 1:18:19.166
Hello! It's me.

1:18:20.375 --> 1:18:21.583
Now listen carefully.

1:18:21.958 --> 1:18:22.833
Thanks, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:18:23.083 --> 1:18:24.458
I am bringing Arul <i>Athaan</i> home.

1:18:25.625 --> 1:18:26.458
What do you mean by who?

1:18:26.583 --> 1:18:28.291
Arul <i>Athaan,</i> Nambi uncle…

1:18:29.250 --> 1:18:30.333
Yes, it's him… yes!

1:18:30.708 --> 1:18:32.125
He's going to stay
with us tonight.

1:18:32.458 --> 1:18:34.208
Get everything ready accordingly, okay?

1:18:34.750 --> 1:18:37.125
Hey… Have you eaten?
She hung up.

1:18:40.875 --> 1:18:41.708
<i>Athaan.</i>

1:18:42.625 --> 1:18:44.666
If I say something, you shouldn't
remove your slippers and hit me.

1:18:45.458 --> 1:18:46.541
I don't know.
Say it and find out.

1:18:47.666 --> 1:18:48.708
It's okay, I'll say it.

1:18:49.625 --> 1:18:52.458
I am so happy you didn't go to Madras.

1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:53.875
I am not.

1:18:54.291 --> 1:18:55.166
That I know.

1:18:55.583 --> 1:18:56.958
Guess why I am happy?

1:18:57.416 --> 1:18:58.333
That also I don't know.

1:18:59.166 --> 1:19:02.208
Because you're going
to stay in my house!

1:19:04.625 --> 1:19:05.583
Big deal, <i>Athaan!</i>

1:19:05.750 --> 1:19:07.291
What's going to happen
if you don't go to work for a day?

1:19:07.708 --> 1:19:08.791
You have come all the way.

1:19:08.875 --> 1:19:10.583
Why don't you just
spend a day relaxing,

1:19:10.708 --> 1:19:12.083
attend your sister's wedding
and then go?

1:19:12.416 --> 1:19:15.833
Instead, you're always
in a hurry to leave.

1:19:21.500 --> 1:19:23.291
Hey, have you boarded the bus?

1:19:23.708 --> 1:19:25.250
I called to tell you about that.

1:19:25.708 --> 1:19:26.833
<i>Why? What happened?</i>

1:19:27.625 --> 1:19:29.083
I missed the bus.

1:19:29.583 --> 1:19:31.541
Hey… What happened?

1:19:31.625 --> 1:19:32.666
I'll tell you that later.

1:19:32.750 --> 1:19:34.500
For now, I've missed the bus. That's all.

1:19:34.708 --> 1:19:36.458
Just do me a favor.
Call my office tomorrow and

1:19:36.541 --> 1:19:37.708
inform them that I am sick.

1:19:37.791 --> 1:19:39.833
Okay, what are you going to do now?

1:19:40.208 --> 1:19:42.708
I'll stay here tonight
and leave in the morning.

1:19:44.083 --> 1:19:45.041
Where are you staying?

1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:50.416
Teacher!

1:19:51.833 --> 1:19:52.666
Come, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:19:52.916 --> 1:19:54.291
<i>Athaan</i> has arrived.
Come fast, come.

1:19:55.750 --> 1:19:56.875
Welcome, brother!

1:19:56.958 --> 1:19:57.875
This is our house, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:20:00.375 --> 1:20:01.416
First, get water.

1:20:07.375 --> 1:20:08.958
BHARATHIAR
KAVIMANI DESIGAVINAYAGAM PILLAI

1:20:09.041 --> 1:20:10.625
BIRSA MUNDA
P. KAKKAN

1:20:18.541 --> 1:20:19.666
<i>Athaan,</i> why did you stop here?

1:20:20.291 --> 1:20:21.125
I was just taking a look.

1:20:21.291 --> 1:20:23.000
They will always be here,
they won't go anywhere.

1:20:23.625 --> 1:20:24.458
Come, let's go inside.

1:20:24.625 --> 1:20:25.583
Tell me what you want to eat,

1:20:25.666 --> 1:20:26.750
-she will get it ready immediately.
-No.

1:20:26.833 --> 1:20:27.958
Shall I ask her to make coffee or tea?

1:20:28.833 --> 1:20:29.666
We already had it, right?

1:20:30.916 --> 1:20:32.208
Will you have something light?

1:20:32.458 --> 1:20:34.958
Oh, no! I am full after eating
at the reception.

1:20:35.583 --> 1:20:37.541
When I come next time,
I'll come and have a meal.

1:20:38.125 --> 1:20:38.958
It's okay, brother.

1:20:39.166 --> 1:20:41.250
Ask for anything you want.
Don't hesitate.

1:20:42.208 --> 1:20:45.916
I am feeling sweaty, can you
tell me where the bathroom is?

1:20:46.166 --> 1:20:47.125
You want to have a bath?

1:20:47.541 --> 1:20:49.458
You can bathe in the bathroom
or shall we go to the river?

1:20:49.750 --> 1:20:50.583
To the river?

1:20:51.666 --> 1:20:52.583
At this hour?

1:20:53.041 --> 1:20:54.500
Did you believe it?
I was just joking.

1:20:54.666 --> 1:20:57.291
-Hot water or cold water?
-Cold.

1:20:57.375 --> 1:20:58.833
Come… come… I will show you
the bathroom and I will also take a bath.

1:20:58.916 --> 1:21:00.250
There is a new "Margo"
soap inside, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:21:00.375 --> 1:21:02.333
Outside near the mirror, you'll find the
comb, oil, and powder.

1:21:02.500 --> 1:21:05.416
You quickly take a bath, I will also go
swiftly and take a bath in the backyard.

1:21:05.958 --> 1:21:08.041
Why are you taking the bag?
Are you going to bathe it or what?

1:21:08.125 --> 1:21:10.083
Hey! My towel and clothes are inside.

1:21:10.375 --> 1:21:13.500
Why? Won't I have a towel?
Won't we give it, if you ask?

1:21:14.041 --> 1:21:16.083
If it gets wet,
it won't dry by morning, <i>Athaan!</i>

1:21:16.458 --> 1:21:18.125
Are you going to keep a wet
towel inside the bag and go?

1:21:18.208 --> 1:21:19.166
It will stink.

1:21:19.458 --> 1:21:21.833
I have a new Turkey towel,
you start having your bath.

1:21:22.041 --> 1:21:23.875
Before you remove your clothes,
I'll hang the towel on the wall.

1:21:23.958 --> 1:21:24.833
<i>Okay.</i>

1:21:25.083 --> 1:21:26.541
Can you go? I have to bathe.

1:21:26.791 --> 1:21:28.250
Shall we see who finishes bathing first?

1:21:28.666 --> 1:21:31.041
-Shall we see?
-Come on! Let's see!

1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:56.875
Hey!

1:21:57.750 --> 1:21:58.625
<i>Athaan,</i>

1:21:59.166 --> 1:22:00.083
do you drink beer?

1:22:00.500 --> 1:22:02.208
Beer? No, I don't want it right now.

1:22:02.541 --> 1:22:03.583
So, you drink.

1:22:04.500 --> 1:22:06.125
No… but I really don't want it right now.

1:22:07.166 --> 1:22:08.750
Did I ask whether
you want it or not?

1:22:08.875 --> 1:22:10.000
I only asked

1:22:10.250 --> 1:22:11.083
whether you drink.

1:22:11.333 --> 1:22:12.791
Answer only the question, okay?

1:22:12.875 --> 1:22:14.791
Okay, sir, I drink, sir!

1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:16.583
Good, let that fear be.

1:22:16.666 --> 1:22:18.083
Two for me and two
for you, is that okay?

1:22:18.583 --> 1:22:19.541
No, one is enough for me.

1:22:20.375 --> 1:22:21.750
Again you're answering
out of the syllabus.

1:22:21.833 --> 1:22:22.916
Wait, let me peep in,
only then you will cave.

1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:24.458
Hey! No…

1:22:24.750 --> 1:22:26.166
Let us both have two beers each.

1:22:27.416 --> 1:22:28.666
Okay, I am going
to finish my bath.

1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:30.708
I think you will lose the competition.

1:23:15.250 --> 1:23:16.083
Brother.

1:23:18.958 --> 1:23:19.791
Brother,

1:23:20.333 --> 1:23:23.041
after your bath, he asked
you to go near the well.

1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:27.041
Sorry, I never asked for all of this…

1:23:27.458 --> 1:23:28.416
No problem, brother.

1:23:28.875 --> 1:23:30.666
He also drinks occasionally.

1:23:30.916 --> 1:23:32.916
Poor soul, he's come up the hard way.

1:23:33.125 --> 1:23:35.375
So I just let him be happy.

1:23:35.833 --> 1:23:36.875
Not just that…

1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:38.416
He likes you a lot.

1:23:39.375 --> 1:23:40.916
This day, that you
have come and stayed,

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:44.291
he will talk about it through the year
with everyone he meets.

1:23:44.375 --> 1:23:45.333
Just wait and watch.

1:23:47.125 --> 1:23:48.291
Even the lizard is approving!

1:23:49.958 --> 1:23:51.750
He normally talks a lot,

1:23:51.875 --> 1:23:54.708
but when he drinks, don't ask!
He talks a lot more.

1:23:54.833 --> 1:23:56.916
For ten questions you have one answer.

1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:58.791
You both are a good match.

1:23:59.083 --> 1:24:00.958
Even then, please adjust.

1:24:01.250 --> 1:24:02.333
That's okay.
What's wrong with that?

1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:05.125
It's late, please sleep.

1:24:05.500 --> 1:24:08.958
Till he comes, I won't be able to sleep.
I will just be lying down.

1:24:09.291 --> 1:24:10.375
I am used to that.

1:24:34.375 --> 1:24:35.375
The garden is beautiful.

1:24:36.750 --> 1:24:39.333
You said it was beer,
and you have a pot. Is it toddy?

1:24:39.666 --> 1:24:41.041
It's beer… beer only, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:24:41.333 --> 1:24:42.875
I don't like Chilled beer
from the fridge,

1:24:42.958 --> 1:24:43.791
pot beer is better.

1:24:43.875 --> 1:24:44.916
Drink and see. It will be fine.

1:24:45.041 --> 1:24:45.916
Sit down.

1:24:51.708 --> 1:24:53.750
<i>Athaan,</i> I am just pouring a little,
the remaining is inside.

1:25:04.625 --> 1:25:05.541
Which song is this, <i>Athaan?</i>

1:25:07.208 --> 1:25:08.083
Song?

1:25:08.458 --> 1:25:09.416
Yes, what you just sang.

1:25:10.208 --> 1:25:11.041
Did I sing?

1:25:12.250 --> 1:25:14.458
Lovely song, <i>Athaan,</i>
sing it once more. I'll know then.

1:25:15.416 --> 1:25:16.250
Which song?

1:25:16.958 --> 1:25:17.833
What is this, <i>Athaan?</i>

1:25:19.041 --> 1:25:19.916
Damn!

1:25:20.708 --> 1:25:22.625
If I don't find out what that
song was, my head will burst.

1:25:24.458 --> 1:25:26.833
It's somewhere here,
it's not coming out now.

1:25:27.833 --> 1:25:29.416
It will come. Here, cheers!

1:25:31.208 --> 1:25:32.083
Cheers!

1:25:45.625 --> 1:25:47.000
You wouldn't have expected, right, <i>Athaan?</i>

1:25:47.416 --> 1:25:49.166
After so many years… with me.

1:25:49.916 --> 1:25:52.833
Gazing at the sky
and blissfully drinking beer.

1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.208
By now you would be traveling
past our town with a serious face.

1:25:56.750 --> 1:25:57.625
Yes,

1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.000
thanks.

1:25:59.333 --> 1:26:00.208
Come on, <i>Athaan!</i>

1:26:00.375 --> 1:26:03.000
My luck was so good,
that you had to come and stay here.

1:26:03.500 --> 1:26:05.166
Have some<i> karasev, Athaan.</i>
Nandini made it.

1:26:07.833 --> 1:26:08.666
It's nice.

1:26:15.750 --> 1:26:16.750
Bhuvana?

1:26:18.083 --> 1:26:19.375
If you feel like talking,
just talk, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:26:20.333 --> 1:26:21.958
I told her something
and kind of confused her.

1:26:22.583 --> 1:26:23.541
There won't be any problem.

1:26:23.625 --> 1:26:24.791
Even if someone gets
caught it will be me.

1:26:25.041 --> 1:26:25.958
You're safe!

1:26:26.958 --> 1:26:27.916
What did you say?

1:26:28.625 --> 1:26:29.458
Tell me.

1:26:29.583 --> 1:26:31.041
Only then I can manage, when she calls.

1:26:31.583 --> 1:26:32.708
That's what even
I can't understand.

1:26:32.791 --> 1:26:34.000
I just blabbered whatever
came to my mouth.

1:26:34.666 --> 1:26:36.416
By the time Bhuvana makes sense of it,
the wedding will be over.

1:26:37.916 --> 1:26:39.041
When did you have
this conversation?

1:26:39.833 --> 1:26:41.791
When you dropped the mug
while taking a bath.

1:26:48.416 --> 1:26:49.458
It's truly a beautiful house.

1:26:51.375 --> 1:26:52.458
Is this the house
where you grew up?

1:26:53.041 --> 1:26:54.041
-This?
-Yes…

1:26:54.416 --> 1:26:55.291
No, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:26:55.750 --> 1:26:57.458
In the house where I grew up,
if we stretch and sleep,

1:26:57.541 --> 1:26:58.833
our hands and legs will hit the wall.

1:26:58.916 --> 1:26:59.750
It's very small.

1:27:00.458 --> 1:27:01.541
This is my father-in-law's house.

1:27:01.875 --> 1:27:02.833
It was built by his grandfather.

1:27:04.458 --> 1:27:05.541
A similar story to yours.

1:27:06.416 --> 1:27:08.000
My wife was born
with two siblings.

1:27:08.083 --> 1:27:09.291
One elder sister,
and one elder brother,

1:27:09.750 --> 1:27:11.041
including her there were three of them.

1:27:11.750 --> 1:27:14.125
After my father-in-law died, there
were fights to divide the wealth.

1:27:14.875 --> 1:27:18.625
They both were arguing,
over what belonged to whom.

1:27:18.708 --> 1:27:19.583
My wife was like,

1:27:19.750 --> 1:27:22.125
"This is the house where my parents
lived, and this is where we grew up,

1:27:22.208 --> 1:27:23.250
we shouldn't sell it."

1:27:23.916 --> 1:27:26.458
She was sitting in one corner
and crying quietly.

1:27:27.041 --> 1:27:29.166
I felt really bad. I thought about it.

1:27:29.791 --> 1:27:31.416
I inquired about
the market rate of the house.

1:27:31.958 --> 1:27:35.625
I somehow arranged for the funds
and settled the two of them.

1:27:36.041 --> 1:27:37.375
Then registered the house in her name.

1:27:38.541 --> 1:27:39.458
Now this is her house.

1:27:40.666 --> 1:27:42.500
Only after coming here,
many good things happened, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:27:43.208 --> 1:27:44.500
She conceived recently.

1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:46.541
Oh! Congratulations.

1:27:47.875 --> 1:27:49.166
All the other times
were miscarriages.

1:27:49.458 --> 1:27:50.458
It's just been three months.

1:27:50.958 --> 1:27:52.666
Doctor has asked us to be very careful.

1:27:52.750 --> 1:27:54.458
That's why I didn't bring her
to the reception.

1:27:55.250 --> 1:27:56.416
It's a very lucky house, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:27:56.875 --> 1:27:58.875
If I had known,
I would've wished her, when I saw her.

1:27:59.291 --> 1:28:00.208
I didn't notice.

1:28:00.375 --> 1:28:01.500
So what, <i>Athaan?</i>

1:28:01.583 --> 1:28:03.416
It's just been three months.
You can't make out.

1:28:03.625 --> 1:28:05.041
It's just a small bump.

1:28:15.583 --> 1:28:19.208
<i>Your hip sways</i>

1:28:19.416 --> 1:28:23.208
<i>Your eyes search for a place</i>

1:28:23.291 --> 1:28:26.708
<i>The sight of your</i>
<i>Feminine form makes me shy</i>

1:28:26.958 --> 1:28:30.791
<i>Happiness burdens me</i>

1:28:30.875 --> 1:28:34.500
<i>What, my darling?</i>

1:28:38.375 --> 1:28:39.666
<i>What, my darling?</i>

1:28:39.750 --> 1:28:43.041
<i>-Thinking about you</i>
<i>-My body shines</i>

1:28:43.125 --> 1:28:45.583
<i>And it pains</i>

1:28:45.666 --> 1:28:47.041
<i>To express that</i>

1:28:47.125 --> 1:28:48.833
<i>It pierces my heart</i>

1:28:48.916 --> 1:28:50.333
<i>Even in heaven</i>

1:28:50.416 --> 1:28:53.083
<i>My Lord is testing me</i>

1:28:53.166 --> 1:28:56.666
<i>-Your body</i>
<i>-Overflows with passion</i>

1:28:56.750 --> 1:29:00.333
<i>Glad that I stay in tune with it</i>

1:29:00.416 --> 1:29:02.375
<i>-This deer…</i>
<i>-This deer…</i>

1:29:03.791 --> 1:29:04.750
That man killed it!

1:29:12.916 --> 1:29:14.250
With this, one bottle is over, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:29:14.875 --> 1:29:17.208
The shirt you were wearing
at the wedding was superb.

1:29:17.500 --> 1:29:19.208
For your complexion,
you looked like a hero.

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:21.083
Bhuvana bought it for me.

1:29:21.875 --> 1:29:23.583
I know, I know.
It was her choice.

1:29:23.875 --> 1:29:25.375
But it was me
who sent you the shirt.

1:29:26.416 --> 1:29:27.250
Is that so?

1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:29.458
The shirt you were wearing
was also very nice.

1:29:29.666 --> 1:29:30.500
Lies!

1:29:30.666 --> 1:29:32.291
Don't just say it,
because I said it.

1:29:32.375 --> 1:29:34.875
Will anyone lie after drinking?

1:29:35.041 --> 1:29:36.250
It really was nice.

1:29:36.666 --> 1:29:37.625
Actually, yes!

1:29:40.291 --> 1:29:43.416
Right from when I was a youngster,
I had a thing for new shirts.

1:29:44.125 --> 1:29:45.750
That smell…

1:29:47.166 --> 1:29:50.500
The thing is, till I started earning,
I never wore new shirts.

1:29:50.708 --> 1:29:52.791
Someone would give me some old ones,
I used to wear them.

1:29:53.500 --> 1:29:55.125
And we never had
slippers as well,

1:29:55.875 --> 1:29:58.166
so our relatives
never accepted us.

1:29:58.916 --> 1:30:00.291
They used to live nearby,

1:30:00.416 --> 1:30:01.583
but they hardly gave a damn about us.

1:30:02.583 --> 1:30:04.666
They wouldn't even allow us
to play with their kids.

1:30:06.125 --> 1:30:07.583
By any chance, if they saw
my father on the road,

1:30:07.666 --> 1:30:09.041
they would just ignore him.

1:30:09.833 --> 1:30:11.291
At that age,

1:30:12.458 --> 1:30:13.458
it really used to hurt me.

1:30:17.416 --> 1:30:18.916
We can't blame anyone, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:30:19.291 --> 1:30:20.625
Everyone is nice,
in some way or the other.

1:30:21.750 --> 1:30:24.166
Money is the root cause
of all the trouble.

1:30:26.041 --> 1:30:27.416
But your father was
never like that, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:30:28.375 --> 1:30:29.916
I used to like him a lot
from when I was little.

1:30:30.583 --> 1:30:31.458
I was such a small kid,

1:30:31.541 --> 1:30:33.375
he used to address
me with respect.

1:30:34.708 --> 1:30:36.666
Not just him, even your mother,

1:30:37.375 --> 1:30:40.333
your Chinna uncle,
Sokku uncle, Bhuvana,

1:30:40.708 --> 1:30:42.125
your elder brother, and you,

1:30:42.750 --> 1:30:44.833
you were all exactly the same,

1:30:45.166 --> 1:30:47.375
you all never gave importance to money.

1:30:48.291 --> 1:30:49.708
You gave importance
to their character.

1:30:50.458 --> 1:30:53.375
Only after seeing all of you,
I yearned for everyone.

1:31:00.083 --> 1:31:00.916
What?

1:31:02.333 --> 1:31:03.166
What is it?

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.125
Wait, I am coming.
<i>Athaan,</i> get up.

1:31:08.333 --> 1:31:09.833
I'll introduce you to someone.

1:31:28.791 --> 1:31:30.416
Hey! He's tied firmly, right?

1:31:30.750 --> 1:31:32.125
A double rope has
been used, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:31:32.583 --> 1:31:34.083
But this is nothing for him,

1:31:34.333 --> 1:31:35.791
if he decides to,
he will just unleash himself!

1:31:36.333 --> 1:31:37.208
It's all fine, come on.

1:31:38.041 --> 1:31:40.416
Let's not go any closer.
His glare doesn't seem normal.

1:31:40.500 --> 1:31:42.791
That's not an issue, <i>Athaan.</i>
I am here, right? Just come.

1:31:43.375 --> 1:31:44.666
Dhoni baby!

1:31:45.250 --> 1:31:46.458
You called out for Daddy?

1:31:47.416 --> 1:31:48.458
It's stunning.

1:31:48.541 --> 1:31:49.458
What breed is the bull?

1:31:49.791 --> 1:31:50.958
-This one?
-Yes…

1:31:51.250 --> 1:31:52.250
Kangayam, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:31:52.708 --> 1:31:54.708
He only looks scary, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:31:54.791 --> 1:31:55.708
He's an affectionate fellow.

1:31:55.958 --> 1:31:56.833
My baby boy!

1:31:57.083 --> 1:31:58.375
In the cattle fair at Thiruvonam,

1:31:58.791 --> 1:32:01.750
he had no buyers
as he was all skin and bones.

1:32:02.083 --> 1:32:03.125
I felt really bad,

1:32:03.708 --> 1:32:04.958
so I made the decision

1:32:05.750 --> 1:32:07.083
and loaded him onto
the mini truck and brought him.

1:32:08.541 --> 1:32:09.625
In the beginning,

1:32:10.375 --> 1:32:11.458
he used to be weak.

1:32:12.083 --> 1:32:13.041
He won't even eat properly.

1:32:13.125 --> 1:32:14.000
I had to literally feed
him with my hands.

1:32:14.958 --> 1:32:17.250
Only after he grew up,
we realized who he really was!

1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:21.250
<i>With those small horns of his,</i>
<i>he was charging at everyone he saw.</i>

1:32:21.916 --> 1:32:24.791
<i>I was stunned.</i>
<i>I got Sokku uncle and showed him.</i>

1:32:25.500 --> 1:32:26.750
<i>He saw him</i>

1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:29.083
<i>and wanted to know where I got him.</i>
<i>His jaw dropped!</i>

1:32:30.041 --> 1:32:32.125
<i>I felt a small sense</i>
<i>of pride within me.</i>

1:32:32.291 --> 1:32:33.208
<i>I felt proud as a calf parent.</i>

1:32:34.041 --> 1:32:35.666
<i>Then we let our boy grow for a year,</i>

1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:37.291
<i>he himself trained him.</i>

1:32:37.875 --> 1:32:39.458
<i>He also got involved</i>
<i>and played well.</i>

1:32:40.125 --> 1:32:41.875
<i>I only panicked cause</i>
<i>he was a sheltered boy,</i>

1:32:42.041 --> 1:32:44.583
<i>and he could get</i>
<i>hurt playing rough.</i>

1:32:44.666 --> 1:32:46.583
-Hey, go!
<i>-I would get scared</i>

1:32:46.708 --> 1:32:47.833
<i>and yelled at as well.</i>

1:32:49.583 --> 1:32:51.125
Yes, come on!

1:32:51.458 --> 1:32:53.166
Look at how you leaped!

1:32:53.541 --> 1:32:55.250
Is it enough to only keep an eye on those
who are coming from the front?

1:32:55.875 --> 1:32:58.416
More than twenty people will come and
pounce on you from all four directions.

1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:00.958
You should keep
an eye on all sides.

1:33:01.041 --> 1:33:02.208
Otherwise, you will lose the game.

1:33:03.708 --> 1:33:04.833
Shall we play again?

1:33:05.625 --> 1:33:06.541
Will you play well?

1:33:07.083 --> 1:33:08.208
Okay, baby!

1:33:13.583 --> 1:33:15.500
<i>Once the training ended,</i>

1:33:15.583 --> 1:33:16.875
<i>his young, tender body had vanished.</i>

1:33:17.208 --> 1:33:19.000
<i>He was like the "Nandhi"</i>
<i>statue at The Thanjavur temple.</i>

1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:22.041
He looked really solid,

1:33:22.125 --> 1:33:23.583
so I thought why not let him
into the arena?

1:33:23.916 --> 1:33:25.250
The next year…

1:33:26.750 --> 1:33:28.125
I think it was 2012.

1:33:28.625 --> 1:33:30.333
There were rumors
that the world was going to end.

1:33:30.833 --> 1:33:32.000
<i>During the harvest festival that year,</i>

1:33:32.250 --> 1:33:34.166
<i>we put him in a van</i>
<i>and took him to Madurai.</i>

1:33:34.500 --> 1:33:36.791
It was his first Jallikattu
at the age of three, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:33:36.916 --> 1:33:37.750
My first time, too.

1:33:38.458 --> 1:33:39.541
<i>The Jallikattu at Avaniyapuram.</i>

1:33:40.083 --> 1:33:41.916
<i>Deafening noise everywhere.</i>

1:33:42.166 --> 1:33:43.708
<i>Couldn't even hear</i>
<i>what the person next to you was saying.</i>

1:33:44.833 --> 1:33:46.458
<i>They were waving their</i>
<i>hands and saying something.</i>

1:33:47.250 --> 1:33:49.208
I unleashed him at the entrance.

1:33:49.666 --> 1:33:50.875
That's all I know.

1:33:52.166 --> 1:33:53.875
<i>He leaped like a tiger,</i>

1:33:53.958 --> 1:33:54.916
<i>arousing the dust!</i>

1:33:55.416 --> 1:33:57.083
Not allowing anyone
to come near him!

1:33:57.250 --> 1:33:58.333
Not an iota of fear.

1:33:59.458 --> 1:34:00.958
<i>The guys shuddered.</i>

1:34:01.416 --> 1:34:03.958
And those who did manage to leap
on him, he easily shoved them aside.

1:34:04.375 --> 1:34:07.083
<i>He literally tossed one guy up,</i>
<i>making him fly mid-air,</i>

1:34:07.166 --> 1:34:08.666
<i>like our "Thala" Dhoni.</i>

1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:11.083
That's how he got
the name Dhoni!

1:34:11.541 --> 1:34:12.583
<i>He won, Athaan!</i>

1:34:12.791 --> 1:34:13.833
<i>His first Jallikattu!</i>

1:34:14.250 --> 1:34:15.583
<i>The prize was a Godrej cupboard.</i>

1:34:16.250 --> 1:34:17.916
<i>They announced his name over the mike,</i>

1:34:18.375 --> 1:34:21.166
<i>and when they announced my</i>
<i>name as the owner of the bull,</i>

1:34:21.583 --> 1:34:22.708
I was overflowing with pride.

1:34:23.125 --> 1:34:24.666
I had goosebumps!

1:34:24.750 --> 1:34:25.791
Look, even now!

1:34:26.666 --> 1:34:28.291
<i>The next day, the Jallikattu</i>
<i>was at Alanganallur.</i>

1:34:28.458 --> 1:34:29.625
<i>After that, Siravayal.</i>

1:34:29.958 --> 1:34:33.208
<i>That year starting from</i>
<i>January till April,</i>

1:34:33.291 --> 1:34:34.625
<i>we didn't miss a single game.</i>

1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:36.625
We went head-on
and won all of them.

1:34:36.875 --> 1:34:37.708
He won!

1:34:38.125 --> 1:34:39.166
<i>An ever silver vessel,</i>

1:34:39.250 --> 1:34:40.291
<i>plastic chair,</i>

1:34:40.375 --> 1:34:42.125
<i>steel cot, silver coin,</i>

1:34:42.208 --> 1:34:43.333
and Nokia phone,

1:34:43.416 --> 1:34:45.500
we had no place
to keep all that we won.

1:34:46.291 --> 1:34:48.125
But on the way to Palamedu,

1:34:48.208 --> 1:34:51.208
<i>our boy created a</i>
<i>scene and we were late.</i>

1:34:51.416 --> 1:34:52.916
<i>That's the only one we missed.</i>

1:34:56.625 --> 1:34:57.541
<i>Because of that,</i>

1:34:57.791 --> 1:35:00.000
for the next entire year,
he trained vigorously.

1:35:00.291 --> 1:35:01.666
<i>When we decided to go to the game</i>

1:35:01.750 --> 1:35:03.166
<i>at Palamedu in 2013</i>
<i>during the harvest festival,</i>

1:35:03.375 --> 1:35:05.166
<i>Sokku uncle couldn't contain</i>
<i>his excitement and came along,</i>

1:35:05.458 --> 1:35:06.833
<i>to add to this, my wife came as well!</i>

1:35:07.333 --> 1:35:10.375
<i>Our boy's entry…</i>
<i>the announcement was electrifying!</i>

1:35:10.666 --> 1:35:11.666
So far at the Jallikattu,
you would have witnessed,

1:35:11.750 --> 1:35:14.708
the black bull, the white bull,
and the red bull, charging in!

1:35:14.875 --> 1:35:17.458
But have you seen a
rocket coming? A rocket!

1:35:17.708 --> 1:35:19.583
The one that's going
to come at rocket's speed is

1:35:19.666 --> 1:35:21.458
the one and only
Needamangalam's Dhoni!

1:35:21.750 --> 1:35:24.583
He hasn't been caught
in a single game, so far!

1:35:24.666 --> 1:35:27.041
He's not just a bull,
he's a maneless lion!

1:35:28.916 --> 1:35:31.375
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

1:35:31.625 --> 1:35:33.333
Here comes the brave Tamil woman!
Our hero's salute to her!

1:35:33.416 --> 1:35:35.375
Congratulations!
Congratulations!

1:35:35.916 --> 1:35:38.791
I request all of you
to clap and encourage her!

1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:43.958
<i>Those guys who were</i>
<i>ready in the arena</i>

1:35:44.041 --> 1:35:46.625
<i>were hell-bent</i>
<i>on catching him.</i>

1:35:48.458 --> 1:35:50.541
<i>I really thought this year</i>
<i>Dhoni would lose the game!</i>

1:36:05.583 --> 1:36:08.333
Dodge! Dodge!

1:36:08.625 --> 1:36:10.666
Superb! Superb!

1:36:22.666 --> 1:36:24.125
What a Spectacle!
Stunning is the word!

1:36:24.708 --> 1:36:26.083
If allowed, looks like he can
play all night without giving up!

1:36:27.166 --> 1:36:28.333
No one's able to touch the bull!

1:36:28.416 --> 1:36:30.416
He's a running riot! He's on fire!

1:36:30.750 --> 1:36:32.916
The great Dhoni gets
a glorious victory…

1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:34.166
Superb!

1:36:34.708 --> 1:36:36.000
We need to continue
the competition,

1:36:36.208 --> 1:36:38.666
please take him
and leave, sister.

1:36:39.666 --> 1:36:42.291
I applaud her courage and on behalf
of the Palamedu Jallikattu…

1:36:42.375 --> 1:36:45.125
One Nokia phone with a dual sim

1:36:45.375 --> 1:36:47.583
is the prize for your courage, sister!

1:36:48.083 --> 1:36:49.833
Here. Catch!

1:36:56.958 --> 1:36:57.875
It's her.

1:36:59.291 --> 1:37:00.125
Hello!

1:37:01.125 --> 1:37:02.625
My dear, haven't you slept yet?

1:37:03.041 --> 1:37:03.916
What?

1:37:04.375 --> 1:37:05.833
You've gone to the backyard, isn't it?

1:37:06.250 --> 1:37:07.875
No, who said so?

1:37:08.791 --> 1:37:09.708
Who needs to tell me?

1:37:09.875 --> 1:37:11.708
I can hear you
speaking from there.

1:37:11.958 --> 1:37:13.125
No, dear.

1:37:13.416 --> 1:37:16.208
You used to say something,
what was that?

1:37:16.333 --> 1:37:19.000
Oh, yes, echo.
It's echoing here, that's the sound.

1:37:19.083 --> 1:37:21.666
<i>Athaan</i> and I are seated near
the well and are quietly drinking.

1:37:22.333 --> 1:37:24.541
I am not a child to be fooled.

1:37:24.625 --> 1:37:26.083
So don't even try it.

1:37:27.250 --> 1:37:29.166
I can clearly hear
your son's bell sound.

1:37:30.583 --> 1:37:31.458
<i>Alright!</i>

1:37:31.541 --> 1:37:33.625
You give the phone to my brother,
I'll talk to him.

1:37:34.083 --> 1:37:35.166
Okay, I'll give it,

1:37:35.458 --> 1:37:36.541
but you should talk only in English.

1:37:37.208 --> 1:37:38.125
No, I won't.

1:37:38.500 --> 1:37:40.000
Aren't you teaching in English at school?

1:37:40.125 --> 1:37:41.125
Then why fuss?

1:37:41.375 --> 1:37:42.541
You speak in English,

1:37:42.625 --> 1:37:44.625
I want to see, whose English is better.

1:37:44.875 --> 1:37:45.875
Not necessary.

1:37:46.125 --> 1:37:47.083
Then I won't give the phone.

1:37:47.541 --> 1:37:48.833
Okay, give it. I'll talk.

1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.333
Okay, I've turned on
the speaker mode. Talk.

1:37:52.750 --> 1:37:54.708
-Hello, brother.
<i>-Hello, tell me.</i>

1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:56.333
-You also talk in English.
-Okay.

1:37:56.791 --> 1:37:59.208
<i>Brother, my husband</i>
<i>never listens to me.</i>

1:37:59.500 --> 1:38:02.625
I've told him several times not to go
to the backyard during the nighttime.

1:38:03.041 --> 1:38:04.291
But he never obeys.

1:38:04.791 --> 1:38:06.250
It is not safe, brother.

1:38:06.750 --> 1:38:07.875
It's okay, sister. Don't worry.

1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:09.375
I'll manage.

1:38:10.375 --> 1:38:11.291
No, brother.

1:38:11.708 --> 1:38:14.750
There are a lot of poisonous insects
which you cannot see in the night.

1:38:15.333 --> 1:38:16.833
<i>Also, there is a cobra snake.</i>

1:38:18.125 --> 1:38:18.958
<i>Ayo!</i>

1:38:20.583 --> 1:38:23.041
<i>It just gave birth</i>
<i>to four or five young ones.</i>

1:38:23.125 --> 1:38:23.958
<i>Ayayo!</i>

1:38:24.625 --> 1:38:26.916
<i>Ayo… </i>that's Tamil,
so 100 rupees fine,

1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:28.541
-and <i>Ayayo</i> is also Tamil so 300 rupees.
-Okay!

1:38:28.875 --> 1:38:30.958
Now you tell me
whether it is safe, brother?

1:38:31.250 --> 1:38:32.125
No… no… no…

1:38:32.750 --> 1:38:35.000
-Is there a snake here?
-Yes, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:38:35.166 --> 1:38:36.375
Cobra. The good snake!

1:38:36.541 --> 1:38:38.500
It just gave birth. Four to five
young ones must be around here.

1:38:38.625 --> 1:38:40.750
You're crazy. Why didn't you
tell me there are snakes here?

1:38:40.833 --> 1:38:42.041
<i>What is this, Athaan?</i>

1:38:42.125 --> 1:38:44.000
You look like a coconut tree,
why are you scared of snakes?

1:38:44.083 --> 1:38:45.333
I'm here, right?
Come, hold my hand.

1:38:45.958 --> 1:38:47.375
Brother, be careful.

1:38:47.541 --> 1:38:50.583
<i>Sometimes the snake will be on the</i>
<i>path. Don't step on them by mistake.</i>

1:38:50.666 --> 1:38:51.875
Stop it, sister.
Don't scare me even more.

1:38:52.375 --> 1:38:53.708
Nothing is visible in the dark.

1:38:54.916 --> 1:38:57.750
Did you notice? In fear, <i>Athaan</i>
is spontaneously talking in Tamil.

1:39:01.375 --> 1:39:02.208
Come on!

1:39:02.416 --> 1:39:03.791
It won't come here, Athaan.

1:39:04.625 --> 1:39:06.750
You're not frightened,
so you're saying that.

1:39:07.333 --> 1:39:09.208
People raise goats
and cows at home.

1:39:09.291 --> 1:39:10.375
How can you raise a snake?

1:39:10.541 --> 1:39:11.916
Oh, gosh! I am not raising it, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:39:12.250 --> 1:39:14.708
Just like how my wife and I live
in this house, it also lives here.

1:39:15.041 --> 1:39:16.125
In fact, it's a senior!

1:39:16.208 --> 1:39:17.125
It's been here for many years.

1:39:17.375 --> 1:39:18.500
-Senior?
-Yes.

1:39:18.583 --> 1:39:19.416
You're too much.

1:39:19.500 --> 1:39:20.375
Okay, forget that.

1:39:21.583 --> 1:39:23.208
When you were in school,

1:39:23.541 --> 1:39:25.833
you had a Raleigh bicycle,
do you remember?

1:39:27.458 --> 1:39:29.958
After that, you bought a
blue color TVS Champ.

1:39:31.500 --> 1:39:33.416
Do you know what happened
to that cycle after that?

1:39:34.083 --> 1:39:36.250
I don't even remember what
happened to the TVS Champ.

1:39:37.208 --> 1:39:38.583
Okay, see if you remember this.

1:39:39.041 --> 1:39:42.625
It had an Undertaker sticker
on its mudguard at the back.

1:39:42.708 --> 1:39:43.666
Correct?

1:39:44.958 --> 1:39:45.833
Yes.

1:39:46.708 --> 1:39:49.666
I had saved up money
over a period of time and,

1:39:50.083 --> 1:39:51.791
bought it at the Amudha fancy store.

1:39:52.458 --> 1:39:53.666
WWF. Undertaker!

1:39:56.750 --> 1:39:59.750
After that issue,
you left town, right?

1:40:00.041 --> 1:40:02.500
You took every
single thing from the house.

1:40:03.208 --> 1:40:05.375
I don't know what you
thought about the cycle,

1:40:05.875 --> 1:40:07.541
but in spite of your situation then…

1:40:07.958 --> 1:40:10.375
"Give this cycle
to someone who needs it…"

1:40:10.458 --> 1:40:11.708
Was apparently what
you said to your father,

1:40:11.916 --> 1:40:13.333
and he told my father,

1:40:13.416 --> 1:40:14.458
and my father told me.

1:40:15.041 --> 1:40:16.166
Did you say that?

1:40:16.708 --> 1:40:17.958
Yeah, where to take it and go?

1:40:18.333 --> 1:40:20.125
I had already ridden it
for around seven to eight years.

1:40:20.875 --> 1:40:22.083
It was old then, itself.

1:40:22.916 --> 1:40:24.750
For me who was playing around
with the palm fruit toy cycle,

1:40:24.833 --> 1:40:26.041
how would it matter,
if it's old or new?

1:40:26.125 --> 1:40:27.708
The minute I knew
the cycle was coming,

1:40:27.791 --> 1:40:29.208
I didn't sleep the whole night.

1:40:29.291 --> 1:40:30.166
I was only thinking about it.

1:40:30.666 --> 1:40:33.083
The next day morning, I wanted to go
with my dad to pick up the cycle.

1:40:33.166 --> 1:40:34.500
I was being stubborn about it.

1:40:34.666 --> 1:40:36.375
But he was like,
"No, you go to school.

1:40:36.541 --> 1:40:39.875
I'll pick up the cycle at Thanjavur,
and get it oiled and checked."

1:40:39.958 --> 1:40:40.791
And he ditched me.

1:40:41.458 --> 1:40:45.208
<i>The whole day at school, I couldn't</i>
<i>even concentrate on one subject.</i>

1:40:45.666 --> 1:40:47.250
<i>How big the cycle will be?</i>

1:40:47.333 --> 1:40:48.333
<i>What color the cycle will be?</i>

1:40:48.416 --> 1:40:50.458
<i>Will I be able to reach its height?</i>
<i>I was imagining it all day.</i>

1:40:54.500 --> 1:40:57.500
SRI VENKATESWARA KINDERGARTEN
NEEDAMANGALAM 614404

1:40:59.666 --> 1:41:02.875
<i>Once all of you left, my father</i>
<i>swept and washed your house.</i>

1:41:03.125 --> 1:41:05.458
<i>He locked it and went and threw</i>
<i>the keys on the faces of those morons!</i>

1:41:05.833 --> 1:41:08.333
<i>Then gave the cycle</i>
<i>a complete makeover.</i>

1:41:08.458 --> 1:41:10.250
<i>He loaded it on top of</i>
<i>the bus and brought it.</i>

1:41:16.166 --> 1:41:18.125
<i>-It came and reached you, right?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1:41:18.708 --> 1:41:19.958
I had no clue about it.

1:41:21.083 --> 1:41:21.958
That's the beauty.

1:41:22.416 --> 1:41:23.916
There's another
thing you don't know.

1:41:24.208 --> 1:41:25.083
Listen, I'll tell you.

1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.250
He was riding the cycle
from the bus stop.

1:41:28.333 --> 1:41:30.833
<i>He started ringing the bell</i>
<i>from the end of the street.</i>

1:41:33.916 --> 1:41:37.291
<i>The minute I heard</i>
<i>the bell sound I ran from home.</i>

1:41:37.833 --> 1:41:40.250
<i>I was running behind</i>
<i>the cycle, clapping!</i>

1:41:41.916 --> 1:41:42.791
Dad,

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.208
-is this our new cycle?
-Yes, my son!

1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.833
He took me for a ride, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:41:53.041 --> 1:41:54.916
<i>I was so happy!</i>

1:41:55.125 --> 1:41:57.500
I was screaming in joy
at the top of my voice!

1:41:57.583 --> 1:41:59.041
<i>My mom was laughing.</i>

1:41:59.250 --> 1:42:02.125
<i>Then he took my brother</i>
<i>and mum along for a round.</i>

1:42:02.625 --> 1:42:06.875
<i>Four of us had never had</i>
<i>so much fun even on festivals.</i>

1:42:07.375 --> 1:42:09.833
After that, I only slept
and woke up near the cycle.

1:42:10.166 --> 1:42:12.458
<i>For a few days, I was pushing it</i>
<i>and running along with it on the street.</i>

1:42:12.916 --> 1:42:15.125
<i>After that, I pushed it</i>
<i>by balancing one foot on the ground.</i>

1:42:15.625 --> 1:42:17.708
<i>And slowly I started</i>
<i>monkey pedaling!</i>

1:42:17.916 --> 1:42:19.500
<i>It was a big deal back then!</i>

1:42:19.958 --> 1:42:22.416
Monkey pedaling
to the nearby shop,

1:42:22.500 --> 1:42:24.208
going to the market,
going to play…

1:42:24.416 --> 1:42:28.083
A neighbor saw me
monkey pedaling for weeks

1:42:28.166 --> 1:42:29.791
and offered to teach me
how to ride the cycle properly.

1:42:29.875 --> 1:42:31.083
I was so scared.

1:42:32.208 --> 1:42:33.375
I refused to sit on the seat.

1:42:33.458 --> 1:42:36.000
<i>"I'll hold it, you won't fall," he said</i>
<i>and pushed it.</i>

1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:39.458
<i>Since I knew he was holding it,</i>
<i>I boldly rode it for a while.</i>

1:42:40.333 --> 1:42:43.416
<i>I suddenly realized his absence,</i>
<i>so I turned back.</i>

1:42:43.500 --> 1:42:44.916
<i>He was missing.</i>

1:42:45.291 --> 1:42:46.750
Seemed like he had
stopped following a while ago.

1:42:47.458 --> 1:42:48.666
I froze in fear!

1:42:48.958 --> 1:42:51.250
<i>My hand was too small</i>
<i>to press the brake.</i>

1:42:51.750 --> 1:42:53.750
I thought of stopping it, at least
by balancing it with my legs,

1:42:53.958 --> 1:42:54.833
but I couldn't reach it.

1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:57.583
<i>By the time I could figure out</i>
<i>what to do, I had crossed my street.</i>

1:42:58.083 --> 1:43:00.875
Thank God! There was a heap
of river sand brought in for construction.

1:43:00.958 --> 1:43:02.125
<i>I rammed straight into it.</i>

1:43:02.333 --> 1:43:05.125
<i>At full speed, I went</i>
<i>and hit the bricks.</i>

1:43:05.208 --> 1:43:06.041
Look here,

1:43:06.625 --> 1:43:07.500
it ripped through.

1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:08.958
Even then,

1:43:09.333 --> 1:43:11.166
I was only worried about
what happened to the cycle.

1:43:11.833 --> 1:43:13.583
<i>People who were around lifted me,</i>

1:43:13.666 --> 1:43:14.625
<i>gave me buttermilk,</i>

1:43:14.750 --> 1:43:16.250
<i>made me sit for a while,</i>
<i>and then sent me on my way.</i>

1:43:18.333 --> 1:43:20.750
But, that's the day I learned
to ride the cycle, <i>Athaan!</i>

1:43:21.375 --> 1:43:24.083
After that, I was just
obsessed with the cycle!

1:43:25.208 --> 1:43:27.333
<i>Riding it, wiping it, oiling it…</i>

1:43:27.416 --> 1:43:28.541
<i>I always kept it sparkling clean.</i>

1:43:29.166 --> 1:43:30.958
<i>I used to take it</i>
<i>to school on weekdays.</i>

1:43:31.041 --> 1:43:32.666
<i>And my father used to</i>
<i>take it on the weekends</i>

1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:34.958
<i>to sell saris,</i>
<i>from street to street.</i>

1:43:36.625 --> 1:43:38.166
<i>My father made a</i>
<i>good income doing that.</i>

1:43:38.750 --> 1:43:42.250
With that, he admitted
my brother and me to a good school.

1:43:42.833 --> 1:43:44.083
It was slightly far from home.

1:43:44.875 --> 1:43:46.416
They sent us because of the cycle.

1:43:47.125 --> 1:43:50.041
Otherwise, we would have had to go by bus
and where was the money for that.

1:43:51.291 --> 1:43:52.333
On the first day,

1:43:52.791 --> 1:43:56.500
he asked me, "Hey! Will you take
your brother safely and bring him back?"

1:43:57.375 --> 1:43:58.416
<i>We went to school</i>

1:43:59.250 --> 1:44:01.125
<i>and returned safely that evening.</i>

1:44:01.833 --> 1:44:03.041
From that day,

1:44:03.916 --> 1:44:05.625
I don't know what my dad thought,

1:44:06.458 --> 1:44:08.208
he never questioned me
about anything, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:44:10.166 --> 1:44:11.666
He won't even call me by my name.

1:44:12.791 --> 1:44:13.958
He'll be like, "Has the elder one come?

1:44:14.625 --> 1:44:15.833
Has the elder one eaten?"

1:44:16.625 --> 1:44:18.125
He started having immense belief in me.

1:44:19.458 --> 1:44:21.041
I wasn't that extraordinary, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:44:21.875 --> 1:44:23.541
It seems he used to tell my mom often,

1:44:24.208 --> 1:44:25.166
"Don't worry,

1:44:26.916 --> 1:44:28.041
no matter what the problem is,

1:44:28.833 --> 1:44:29.958
the elder one will take care."

1:44:33.958 --> 1:44:35.041
That cycle…

1:44:35.708 --> 1:44:38.291
in a way changed everything, <i>Athaan!</i>

1:44:40.250 --> 1:44:41.541
What my father earned,

1:44:42.083 --> 1:44:43.125
my education,

1:44:43.416 --> 1:44:44.958
my brother going to college,

1:44:45.541 --> 1:44:48.125
in fact, even for my wedding,
I arrived in that cycle!

1:44:48.875 --> 1:44:50.541
If your cycle hadn't been there,

1:44:51.500 --> 1:44:52.958
my life would have
been very different.

1:44:53.416 --> 1:44:54.333
Not like this!

1:44:56.166 --> 1:44:59.750
I didn't say that
thinking so much good would happen.

1:45:01.166 --> 1:45:03.000
I don't know what you
thought while giving it,

1:45:04.166 --> 1:45:06.458
and what your father thought
while giving it to us,

1:45:08.125 --> 1:45:09.416
but every Ayudha puja,
when we worship our tools,

1:45:10.250 --> 1:45:12.625
I pray to that cycle, as God!

1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:18.375
-What is this…
-Thanks, <i>Athaan!</i>

1:45:20.208 --> 1:45:22.041
Why now…

1:45:23.666 --> 1:45:25.250
You know, why I told you all this now?

1:45:26.291 --> 1:45:27.166
Turn around!

1:45:28.166 --> 1:45:29.291
Turn and look!

1:45:30.625 --> 1:45:32.125
Your cycle is right here.

1:45:36.458 --> 1:45:37.375
Come.

1:45:43.875 --> 1:45:44.916
It's your cycle, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:45.875
Take a look.

1:45:55.416 --> 1:45:56.333
It's just the same.

1:45:57.625 --> 1:45:58.750
Nothing has changed.

1:45:59.333 --> 1:46:00.875
Changed? I haven't allowed it to change!

1:46:01.625 --> 1:46:02.791
Is this <i>just</i> a cycle?

1:46:03.791 --> 1:46:06.083
They said it's old, you have
to change this and that…

1:46:06.291 --> 1:46:07.583
I told them it wasn't necessary.

1:46:08.083 --> 1:46:11.208
I strictly told them that it
had to stay this way forever.

1:46:12.625 --> 1:46:15.916
I just had to change the chain,
ball bearing, and the paint.

1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:16.875
There was no choice.

1:46:17.666 --> 1:46:18.541
Is it in running condition?

1:46:18.625 --> 1:46:19.541
Of course!

1:46:24.750 --> 1:46:25.833
I never expected this.

1:46:26.875 --> 1:46:29.750
After this, two beers
won't be enough!

1:46:31.125 --> 1:46:32.083
What are you saying, <i>Athaan?</i>

1:46:32.958 --> 1:46:33.833
I meant it casually.

1:46:34.125 --> 1:46:35.166
Tell me if you want to drink.

1:46:36.958 --> 1:46:39.750
Gentleman, at this hour,
where will you buy beer?

1:46:40.375 --> 1:46:41.291
Hello, sir!

1:46:41.625 --> 1:46:43.333
-Where are you?
-Where?

1:46:43.625 --> 1:46:45.333
-In Needamangalam.
-So?

1:46:45.666 --> 1:46:46.583
With whom?

1:46:47.291 --> 1:46:48.125
With whom?

1:46:48.333 --> 1:46:49.208
With me!

1:46:49.791 --> 1:46:50.791
You don't know who I am.

1:46:59.833 --> 1:47:01.125
-Kanagarasu?
<i>-Yes?</i>

1:47:01.208 --> 1:47:02.666
-Are you asleep?
<i>-Yes… yes…</i>

1:47:02.750 --> 1:47:03.625
Okay, wake up.

1:47:04.166 --> 1:47:05.166
-Hey!
<i>-What?</i>

1:47:05.250 --> 1:47:06.083
An urgent requirement.

1:47:06.250 --> 1:47:07.458
Like in the times of war.

1:47:07.708 --> 1:47:08.833
I need four strong beers.

1:47:09.500 --> 1:47:10.500
If possible, chilled.

1:47:10.958 --> 1:47:11.833
No, not "if possible,"

1:47:11.916 --> 1:47:13.708
it has to be chilled,
it's for my <i>Athaan.</i>

1:47:14.166 --> 1:47:15.250
Take the money from
the shop in the morning.

1:47:15.333 --> 1:47:16.333
<i>I'll check and tell you.</i>

1:47:16.416 --> 1:47:18.000
-Will you?
<i>-Yes!</i>

1:47:18.083 --> 1:47:19.000
Okay, I'll hold.

1:47:22.583 --> 1:47:23.500
<i>It's available.</i>

1:47:23.583 --> 1:47:24.625
-It's available?
<i>-Yes!</i>

1:47:24.708 --> 1:47:25.708
-It's chilled?
<i>-Yes!</i>

1:47:25.791 --> 1:47:27.333
Superb, brother!

1:47:27.416 --> 1:47:28.875
-Superb!
<i>-Where to bring it?</i>

1:47:28.958 --> 1:47:29.791
Where to bring it…

1:47:30.208 --> 1:47:32.458
<i>Athaan,</i> do you want to continue
the next round here

1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:34.791
or shall we go to the dam?

1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:36.000
Dam…

1:47:36.916 --> 1:47:38.375
-Hey, brother! Da…
<i>-Dam.</i>

1:47:38.583 --> 1:47:39.416
Yes, there only.

1:47:39.708 --> 1:47:40.666
-Hey! In the po--
<i>-Pot…</i>

1:47:40.750 --> 1:47:41.916
-Two--
<i>-Two mugs…</i>

1:47:42.833 --> 1:47:43.708
He hung up.

1:47:43.791 --> 1:47:44.625
<i>How's that?</i>

1:47:44.708 --> 1:47:45.916
Let's leave, the beer
won't remain chill for long.

1:47:47.166 --> 1:47:48.416
Shall we go on the cycle?

1:48:27.041 --> 1:48:28.208
Are they biting you?

1:48:28.500 --> 1:48:29.500
All freshwater fingerlings.

1:48:29.958 --> 1:48:31.458
Just dip your legs,
it will be relaxing.

1:48:37.833 --> 1:48:39.083
He has already poured
and kept it.

1:48:55.375 --> 1:48:56.291
<i>Athaan.</i>

1:48:57.333 --> 1:48:59.375
Whenever I see the moon growing,

1:49:00.333 --> 1:49:02.291
it reminds me of my
child growing in the womb.

1:49:05.833 --> 1:49:07.333
Guess, what name
I've decided on?

1:49:07.833 --> 1:49:08.750
How will I know?

1:49:09.625 --> 1:49:11.041
You're the one who will know,

1:49:11.333 --> 1:49:12.416
but you won't be able to guess.

1:49:12.958 --> 1:49:14.500
Yeah, right! Then, how?

1:49:15.833 --> 1:49:17.458
I don't even know
if it's a boy or a girl.

1:49:18.708 --> 1:49:19.791
Should I guess two names?

1:49:19.875 --> 1:49:20.833
Not two names and all,

1:49:21.041 --> 1:49:21.958
just one.

1:49:22.166 --> 1:49:24.833
Whether it's a boy or a girl,
it's the same name.

1:49:25.291 --> 1:49:26.125
That's the clue.

1:49:26.208 --> 1:49:27.583
-Try guessing now!
-Even if it's a boy,

1:49:27.666 --> 1:49:28.666
or if it's a girl?

1:49:31.583 --> 1:49:32.416
Thangam.

1:49:32.875 --> 1:49:33.708
No!

1:49:39.250 --> 1:49:40.083
Madhu.

1:49:40.666 --> 1:49:41.500
Fail!

1:49:43.291 --> 1:49:44.708
You want to try once more?

1:49:45.416 --> 1:49:46.291
Shall I say it?

1:49:46.375 --> 1:49:47.416
I don't know. Go ahead.

1:49:49.333 --> 1:49:50.583
Arulmozhi.

1:49:52.708 --> 1:49:53.583
How is it?

1:49:57.416 --> 1:49:58.291
It's nice.

1:50:14.375 --> 1:50:15.250
<i>Athaan,</i>

1:50:16.208 --> 1:50:18.333
from the time you came,
I have been noticing,

1:50:18.708 --> 1:50:21.125
that if I don't talk for a while,
you get buried in your thoughts.

1:50:25.333 --> 1:50:27.583
Your face has turned pale all of a sudden.

1:50:28.458 --> 1:50:29.416
What is it?

1:50:29.583 --> 1:50:30.750
Thinking about the old house?

1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.125
It's been 20 years
and you're still thinking about it.

1:50:40.500 --> 1:50:42.750
Those days I used to be so happy
to get back home from school.

1:50:46.333 --> 1:50:47.666
I like that house a lot.

1:50:49.875 --> 1:50:51.416
After I came home,
I wouldn't go straight inside.

1:50:52.083 --> 1:50:53.500
I'd hang my bag on the gate.

1:50:53.583 --> 1:50:55.166
Then climb and sit on the wall,

1:50:55.333 --> 1:50:56.958
looking at all the passers-by.

1:50:57.958 --> 1:51:01.458
<i>The boys used to draw stumps</i>
<i>on our wall to play cricket.</i>

1:51:02.458 --> 1:51:03.666
<i>I never played much then.</i>

1:51:05.166 --> 1:51:07.500
<i>I used to sit on the wall</i>
<i>and just be an umpire!</i>

1:51:09.500 --> 1:51:10.458
Hey, throw it like this.

1:51:10.541 --> 1:51:11.875
<i>In the evening, my mother</i>

1:51:12.166 --> 1:51:14.250
<i>used to keep a tumbler</i>
<i>of milk on the wall</i>

1:51:14.625 --> 1:51:15.666
<i>and tap my shoulder.</i>

1:51:17.125 --> 1:51:19.791
When you dip
the "Milk Bikis" biscuit in it…

1:51:20.541 --> 1:51:21.625
<i>You won't notice time flying by.</i>

1:51:24.666 --> 1:51:27.541
In our house, including my grandparents,
there were just six of us.

1:51:29.833 --> 1:51:34.375
<i>But there would always be</i>
<i>around 15 to 20 people at home.</i>

1:51:34.583 --> 1:51:35.750
<i>I remember, Athaan.</i>

1:51:36.791 --> 1:51:39.458
The house extended from
one street into the next.

1:51:40.375 --> 1:51:42.500
From the entrance to the backyard,
you used to conduct running races.

1:51:42.583 --> 1:51:43.416
Yes.

1:51:43.541 --> 1:51:44.791
What a big house!

1:51:45.791 --> 1:51:47.500
Uncle has built it
just like his big heart.

1:51:48.416 --> 1:51:49.750
The house was built
by my great-grandfather.

1:51:50.208 --> 1:51:51.125
Oh!

1:51:51.458 --> 1:51:53.250
My grandfather, my father,

1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:55.291
uncle, brother,

1:51:55.541 --> 1:51:57.166
and me,
all of us were born in that house.

1:51:59.208 --> 1:52:00.583
I've never seen my great-grandfather.

1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:02.416
He died before I was born.

1:52:03.916 --> 1:52:05.875
I don't even have a photograph.

1:52:06.791 --> 1:52:08.041
But I know his name.

1:52:08.791 --> 1:52:10.125
Sivapadha Sekaran.

1:52:16.375 --> 1:52:17.875
For me,
that house is my great-grandfather.

1:52:21.583 --> 1:52:23.083
I like that house a lot, man.

1:52:25.375 --> 1:52:27.291
There's not a spot in the house
where my feet haven't touched.

1:52:30.083 --> 1:52:32.958
My wish was to live
in that house till I die.

1:52:34.416 --> 1:52:35.541
But look at my fate,

1:52:37.625 --> 1:52:38.958
they snatched it away
from me before that.

1:52:41.958 --> 1:52:43.083
The problem is,

1:52:44.583 --> 1:52:45.541
I am not able to forget that.

1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:50.166
Then how will my face look?

1:52:52.916 --> 1:52:54.208
What is there for me to laugh about?

1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:55.916
Should I laugh at myself?

1:53:05.041 --> 1:53:06.916
More than anyone,

1:53:08.333 --> 1:53:12.750
you understand everything I say
and don't say,

1:53:13.500 --> 1:53:14.583
you don't console me.

1:53:15.333 --> 1:53:16.375
No, <i>Athaan…</i>

1:53:16.750 --> 1:53:17.833
How can I… You…

1:53:18.958 --> 1:53:21.583
-What I meant was…
-For you…

1:53:21.875 --> 1:53:23.416
Well, what that cycle means to you,

1:53:24.708 --> 1:53:25.958
is exactly what the house means to me.

1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:28.875
Now, talk.

1:53:31.458 --> 1:53:32.291
Talk.

1:53:36.083 --> 1:53:37.541
Oh, god! I am not saying anything.

1:53:39.958 --> 1:53:41.333
Okay, don't go wandering here and there.

1:53:41.416 --> 1:53:42.833
Just sit here and drink your beer.

1:53:42.916 --> 1:53:43.958
I'll take a piss and come.

1:53:44.041 --> 1:53:44.958
Hey!

1:53:45.291 --> 1:53:47.583
Why? Haven't I had beer?
Won't I want to pee?

1:53:48.833 --> 1:53:49.750
Okay, come.

1:53:55.750 --> 1:53:58.166
A…

1:54:02.833 --> 1:54:04.833
B…

1:54:09.750 --> 1:54:10.666
Silly girl!

1:54:12.750 --> 1:54:16.333
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

1:54:21.041 --> 1:54:21.875
<i>Athaan,</i>

1:54:22.166 --> 1:54:23.416
I wore your slippers by mistake.

1:54:23.958 --> 1:54:25.958
I know. So what?

1:54:28.416 --> 1:54:30.333
It is fluffy.
It is very soft.

1:54:30.916 --> 1:54:32.458
I can't even feel it
on my feet, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:42.166
<i>Athaan,</i> stop… stop!

1:54:43.208 --> 1:54:44.208
What happened?

1:54:45.916 --> 1:54:46.916
I got it.

1:54:47.083 --> 1:54:48.041
Who I am after all!

1:54:55.208 --> 1:54:59.416
<i>The cloud that travels through the sky</i>

1:54:59.708 --> 1:55:02.916
<i>Who is it searching for?</i>

1:55:03.083 --> 1:55:07.250
<i>The fragrant flower's soulful music</i>

1:55:07.583 --> 1:55:10.750
<i>Who does it sing about?</i>

1:55:10.833 --> 1:55:14.583
<i>Feelings expressed through music</i>

1:55:14.708 --> 1:55:18.416
<i>Won't they go reach</i>
<i>Our kith and kin</i>

1:55:18.541 --> 1:55:21.958
<i>And then let the special day</i>
<i>Of togetherness unfold</i>

1:55:22.375 --> 1:55:25.708
<i>And let joy rule</i>

1:55:25.791 --> 1:55:30.291
<i>They are like blooming evening flowers</i>

1:55:30.458 --> 1:55:35.083
<i>They are the new wildflowers</i>

1:55:36.416 --> 1:55:39.416
<i>The summer's cool breeze</i>

1:55:39.916 --> 1:55:43.416
<i>The cool breeze that sings</i>

1:55:47.083 --> 1:55:47.916
You sing well.

1:55:48.291 --> 1:55:50.083
-I dance well too, <i>Athaan.</i>
-Wow, me too!

1:55:50.166 --> 1:55:52.625
I can do the steps
of actor Anand Babu really well.

1:55:53.708 --> 1:55:54.541
Hold this!

1:55:55.458 --> 1:55:58.666
-Micheal Jackson, moonwalk!
-Hey! Hey!

1:55:58.750 --> 1:56:01.041
Hey! Superb!

1:56:11.875 --> 1:56:14.125
WELCOME

1:56:27.291 --> 1:56:29.041
Where are you coming from
at this hour?

1:56:29.333 --> 1:56:30.291
Auntie, from the temple!

1:56:30.375 --> 1:56:32.333
You're roaming around,
leaving a pregnant woman at home!

1:56:32.416 --> 1:56:34.500
<i>Athaan,</i> are you happy?

1:56:35.500 --> 1:56:36.333
Very happy!

1:56:36.500 --> 1:56:37.333
Are you happy?

1:56:37.666 --> 1:56:38.791
Double happy!

1:56:39.625 --> 1:56:42.750
It feels sweet, like drinking water
after eating a gooseberry.

1:56:45.958 --> 1:56:47.125
<i>-Athaan?</i>
-Yes?

1:56:48.500 --> 1:56:50.083
Can I ask you something?

1:56:51.791 --> 1:56:53.458
Should we leave the cycle outside?

1:56:54.291 --> 1:56:55.166
Yes.

1:56:56.333 --> 1:56:57.250
Okay.

1:56:57.875 --> 1:56:58.750
Ask me.

1:56:59.791 --> 1:57:00.791
You said you wanted
to ask something.

1:57:04.416 --> 1:57:05.291
I forgot.

1:57:07.250 --> 1:57:09.500
<i>Athaan,</i> there are steps…

1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:11.041
Hey, watch out.

1:57:13.125 --> 1:57:15.583
Look, just for you!

1:57:16.083 --> 1:57:20.541
Sleep on this jute bed and see.
You will sleep so well.

1:57:22.250 --> 1:57:23.083
I remembered…

1:57:25.041 --> 1:57:26.125
I remembered.

1:57:26.958 --> 1:57:27.916
Tell me, before you forget.

1:57:29.083 --> 1:57:31.458
Let me first be safe.

1:57:34.875 --> 1:57:35.708
<i>Athaan,</i>

1:57:36.666 --> 1:57:38.750
you definitely won't like it.

1:57:39.958 --> 1:57:43.000
Nevertheless,
since I have the right to, I'll ask.

1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:45.125
For my sake…

1:57:47.500 --> 1:57:49.833
For my sake,
forgive those four people, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:57:55.750 --> 1:57:57.125
For your good heart, if you
curse them even a little bit,

1:57:57.333 --> 1:58:01.333
something really bad will
happen to them, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:58:02.166 --> 1:58:03.375
Let's not do that, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:58:16.250 --> 1:58:17.125
Okay,

1:58:18.333 --> 1:58:19.208
I've forgiven them.

1:58:20.250 --> 1:58:21.875
Feels like you're just saying
for the sake of it.

1:58:21.958 --> 1:58:24.208
I am asking you seriously,
and you're mocking me.

1:58:25.375 --> 1:58:26.291
I swear, I've forgiven them.

1:58:27.208 --> 1:58:28.166
Really?

1:58:29.833 --> 1:58:30.708
I promise.

1:58:32.833 --> 1:58:34.458
Superb, <i>Athaan!</i> My <i>Athaan!</i>

1:58:36.083 --> 1:58:38.500
Because of us, nothing bad
should happen to anyone.

1:58:38.583 --> 1:58:40.541
Let them do what they want.

1:58:41.375 --> 1:58:42.458
How are you like this?

1:58:43.333 --> 1:58:45.416
Even my wife asks me the same thing.

1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:48.666
Just stay this way. Don't change.

1:58:49.416 --> 1:58:50.416
You lie down, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:58:50.958 --> 1:58:52.666
I won't get sleep now.

1:58:52.791 --> 1:58:55.541
I'll wake you up on time.

1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:57.208
I'll sit here, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:59:00.916 --> 1:59:03.958
<i>Athaan,</i> before you go,

1:59:04.750 --> 1:59:07.958
bless us, so that little Arulmozhi
is born healthy.

1:59:08.041 --> 1:59:08.875
Okay.

1:59:17.958 --> 1:59:18.833
<i>Athaan,</i>

1:59:20.458 --> 1:59:23.416
I've noticed
from the time you came,

1:59:23.916 --> 1:59:27.458
you never called me by my name.

1:59:29.250 --> 1:59:32.000
You're talking to me as though
you're talking to a stranger, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:59:34.250 --> 1:59:35.958
Tomorrow morning,

1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:38.916
call all three of us by our names.

1:59:40.375 --> 1:59:42.750
Bless us and then leave, <i>Athaan.</i>

1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:44.875
Okay?

1:59:46.375 --> 1:59:47.250
Okay?

2:01:08.750 --> 2:01:10.708
-He slept?
-Yes.

2:01:10.916 --> 2:01:12.000
When did you come, brother?

2:01:12.375 --> 2:01:13.208
Just now.

2:01:14.458 --> 2:01:15.541
Aren't you sleeping, brother?

2:01:16.625 --> 2:01:18.375
I am feeling sleepy,
but I am not able to sleep.

2:01:19.166 --> 2:01:20.083
Please go and sleep.

2:01:21.541 --> 2:01:22.500
Are you hungry, brother?

2:01:22.958 --> 2:01:24.083
You want to eat anything?

2:01:24.208 --> 2:01:25.208
No, I don't want anything.

2:01:31.125 --> 2:01:34.750
Did he tell you what we're
going to name the child, brother?

2:01:35.708 --> 2:01:37.041
Yes, he told me.

2:01:39.083 --> 2:01:39.958
It's my name.

2:01:44.958 --> 2:01:45.875
You go and sleep.

2:01:50.083 --> 2:01:51.000
Okay, brother.

2:01:51.458 --> 2:01:53.208
If you need anything, call me.

2:01:53.291 --> 2:01:54.125
Yes.

2:02:39.916 --> 2:02:41.500
<i>Who?</i>

2:02:41.583 --> 2:02:43.666
<i>Who is he?</i>

2:02:43.750 --> 2:02:45.791
<i>Kith or kin</i>

2:02:45.875 --> 2:02:47.416
<i>Wonder who he is?</i>

2:02:53.041 --> 2:02:54.625
<i>Affection</i>

2:02:54.708 --> 2:02:57.333
<i>Unconditional affection, he giveth!</i>

2:02:57.416 --> 2:03:01.166
<i>Wonder who he is?</i>

2:03:06.125 --> 2:03:09.875
<i>The tender, infinite, pure affection</i>

2:03:09.958 --> 2:03:13.458
<i>I lost!</i>

2:03:19.208 --> 2:03:23.000
<i>From the bond</i>
<i>I always yearned for</i>

2:03:23.083 --> 2:03:27.375
<i>I drift away</i>

2:03:36.625 --> 2:03:38.291
<i>Who?</i>

2:03:38.375 --> 2:03:40.458
<i>Who is he?</i>

2:03:40.541 --> 2:03:42.625
<i>Kith or kin</i>

2:03:42.708 --> 2:03:44.458
<i>Wonder who he is?</i>

2:03:44.833 --> 2:03:47.041
<i>Unexpectedly</i>

2:03:47.125 --> 2:03:51.416
<i>Overflowing with a mother's love!</i>

2:03:51.500 --> 2:03:55.458
<i>Who is he?</i>

2:04:38.500 --> 2:04:41.750
<i>The bane is the boon</i>

2:04:42.750 --> 2:04:47.041
<i>The swirl of life that haunts me</i>

2:04:47.291 --> 2:04:51.583
<i>A coward's legs today</i>

2:04:52.625 --> 2:04:55.958
<i>Fall, laden with the truth</i>

2:04:56.041 --> 2:04:59.500
<i>I am a stagnated pool of water</i>

2:05:00.333 --> 2:05:04.458
<i>Your shower of boundless mercy is enough</i>

2:05:04.708 --> 2:05:08.041
<i>My heart, a sinner</i>

2:05:08.125 --> 2:05:13.083
<i>Set's me ablaze!</i>

2:05:13.416 --> 2:05:17.791
<i>Without dissolving in the rain!</i>

2:05:17.875 --> 2:05:21.958
<i>The mountain stands forever tall</i>

2:05:22.166 --> 2:05:29.166
<i>The sky never falls</i>
<i>With the raindrop!</i>

2:05:30.875 --> 2:05:35.333
<i>I fall as a lie and lose</i>

2:05:35.416 --> 2:05:39.541
<i>In front of the truth</i>
<i>That you embody</i>

2:05:39.625 --> 2:05:43.833
<i>This unparalleled affection</i>

2:05:43.958 --> 2:05:47.375
<i>When will I witness?</i>

2:05:47.500 --> 2:05:49.125
<i>-Who?</i>
<i>-Who?</i>

2:05:49.208 --> 2:05:51.291
<i>-Who is he?</i>
<i>-Who is he?</i>

2:05:51.375 --> 2:05:53.416
<i>-Kith or kin</i>
<i>-Kith or kin</i>

2:05:53.500 --> 2:05:55.000
<i>-Wonder who he is?</i>
<i>-Wonder who he is?</i>

2:05:55.666 --> 2:05:57.875
<i>-Unexpectedly</i>
<i>-Unexpectedly</i>

2:05:57.958 --> 2:06:02.208
<i>-Overflowing with a mother's love!</i>
<i>-Overflowing with a mother's love!</i>

2:06:02.291 --> 2:06:05.000
<i>-Who is he?</i>
<i>-Who is he?</i>

2:06:05.083 --> 2:06:06.625
<i>-Who?</i>
<i>-Who?</i>

2:06:06.708 --> 2:06:08.750
<i>-Who?</i>
<i>-Who?</i>

2:06:08.833 --> 2:06:10.916
<i>-Kith or kin</i>
<i>-Kith or kin</i>

2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:12.166
<i>-Wonder who he is?</i>
<i>-Wonder who he is?</i>

2:06:13.166 --> 2:06:15.333
<i>-Unexpectedly</i>
<i>-Unexpectedly</i>

2:06:15.416 --> 2:06:19.625
<i>-Overflowing with a mother's love!</i>
<i>-Overflowing with a mother's love!</i>

2:06:19.708 --> 2:06:24.000
<i>-Who is he?</i>
<i>-Who is he?</i>

2:06:38.583 --> 2:06:41.500
HAIL LORD SHIVA

2:06:54.958 --> 2:06:55.791
Brother.

2:06:57.625 --> 2:06:59.875
<i>Come, leave your slippers here,</i>
<i>buy some flowers and go.</i>

2:07:03.833 --> 2:07:05.208
Why, brother?
After coming this close,

2:07:05.291 --> 2:07:06.791
you're going back
without going inside the temple?

2:07:09.291 --> 2:07:11.333
Brother, it's okay
if you don't buy flowers,

2:07:11.416 --> 2:07:12.666
but just go inside,
and offer your prayers.

2:07:12.750 --> 2:07:13.833
It's an auspicious day today.

2:07:17.125 --> 2:07:18.000
I haven't had a bath.

2:07:18.625 --> 2:07:21.166
So what!
You're going to see our God, after all.

2:07:21.250 --> 2:07:22.208
Why do you need
cleanliness for that?

2:07:22.291 --> 2:07:23.625
God won't get angry, you go!

2:07:26.250 --> 2:07:27.250
Where is the bus stand?

2:07:29.083 --> 2:07:30.458
Where do you have to go?

2:07:31.083 --> 2:07:32.791
The bus that goes to Thiruvarur,
will not pass from here.

2:07:33.083 --> 2:07:34.708
It will come up to Anna's statue
and then take a turn.

2:07:34.875 --> 2:07:38.500
I need to go to Madras.
Actually, any place is fine,

2:07:39.416 --> 2:07:40.333
I just need to leave from here.

2:07:41.375 --> 2:07:44.250
Every ten minutes, there is a bus
to Thanjavur. It will stop here.

2:07:44.375 --> 2:07:45.791
-But…
-Thanjavur works.

2:07:56.833 --> 2:07:58.041
Can you do me a favor?

2:07:58.958 --> 2:08:02.208
When you go inside the temple,
just take a few flowers and…

2:08:02.333 --> 2:08:03.333
You want me to do an offering?

2:08:03.416 --> 2:08:04.291
Yes.

2:08:04.541 --> 2:08:05.375
In whose name?

2:08:10.666 --> 2:08:11.583
I don't know the name.

2:08:13.458 --> 2:08:14.625
Do it in the name of God.

2:08:23.125 --> 2:08:23.958
Brother,

2:08:24.875 --> 2:08:26.833
till the bus comes,
why don't you sit here?

2:08:26.958 --> 2:08:27.791
It's alright.

2:08:48.958 --> 2:08:50.250
Will you have tea, brother?

2:08:50.958 --> 2:08:52.083
-No.
-Why not?

2:08:53.666 --> 2:08:54.500
The bus will come.

2:08:54.750 --> 2:08:57.000
So what?
You can go on the next bus.

2:08:59.083 --> 2:08:59.958
I haven't brushed my teeth.

2:09:02.583 --> 2:09:03.541
So you haven't
brushed your teeth.

2:09:04.875 --> 2:09:06.791
Without even brushing your teeth,
or taking a bath,

2:09:07.250 --> 2:09:09.166
why are you in a hurry
to go to Madras?

2:09:56.791 --> 2:09:57.625
Hey!

2:09:58.041 --> 2:09:59.750
When did you come?
You never called.

2:11:34.125 --> 2:11:35.333
What happened to you, Arul?

2:11:36.583 --> 2:11:38.666
You don't seem alright
ever since you came back.

2:11:39.958 --> 2:11:41.166
Did something happen there?

2:11:47.416 --> 2:11:49.041
What happened to you, tell me?

2:11:53.083 --> 2:11:54.916
Hema, I told you I met
someone there, right?

2:11:55.541 --> 2:11:56.458
Yes.

2:11:57.583 --> 2:11:59.291
He was so affectionate towards me.

2:12:01.208 --> 2:12:03.958
Not just me, he's very
affectionate with everyone.

2:12:06.166 --> 2:12:08.916
He remembers incidents that
happened so many years ago.

2:12:11.333 --> 2:12:14.208
He worships the cycle that I gave
him unknowingly many years ago.

2:12:17.791 --> 2:12:19.916
He takes care of his bull
like his own child.

2:12:20.250 --> 2:12:21.666
He talks to everything…

2:12:22.583 --> 2:12:24.458
The fish in the sea,
the birds on the tree.

2:12:26.958 --> 2:12:30.125
He says he's going to name
his child after me.

2:12:31.916 --> 2:12:33.333
But I don't know his name.

2:12:35.666 --> 2:12:37.083
You call and talk to him, Arul.

2:12:37.166 --> 2:12:38.208
How can I even do that, Hema?

2:12:40.166 --> 2:12:41.041
He's right up here.

2:12:42.916 --> 2:12:45.875
But I saw him as a nuisance.

2:12:46.875 --> 2:12:49.750
He asked me for my mobile number.
I purposely gave him the wrong number.

2:12:52.208 --> 2:12:53.833
I didn't even ask for his name.

2:12:54.291 --> 2:12:55.291
I pretended like I knew him.

2:12:56.791 --> 2:12:58.041
Actually, he's up there,

2:12:59.125 --> 2:13:00.041
I am down here.

2:13:02.666 --> 2:13:04.916
I am feeling ashamed
to even call and apologize to him.

2:13:08.333 --> 2:13:09.208
Arul.

2:13:23.541 --> 2:13:24.458
Stretch.

2:13:43.958 --> 2:13:44.833
<i>Okay, uncle.</i>

2:13:45.750 --> 2:13:46.625
Okay, uncle.

2:13:46.958 --> 2:13:48.791
Not at all, uncle.
This itself is a huge favor.

2:13:51.375 --> 2:13:53.291
Uncle, six months is
the maximum time I'll take.

2:13:53.375 --> 2:13:54.666
But, I will return it before that.

2:13:56.041 --> 2:13:56.875
Okay, uncle.

2:13:57.250 --> 2:13:58.958
Thank you.
Thank you, Bye.

2:14:00.333 --> 2:14:01.166
All good?

2:14:01.500 --> 2:14:03.041
Just wait, this won't be enough.
We need more.

2:14:03.541 --> 2:14:04.583
Exactly how much do we need?

2:14:06.041 --> 2:14:07.208
We need another 25 lakhs.

2:14:13.458 --> 2:14:14.291
How much do you need?

2:14:14.375 --> 2:14:16.166
Sir, I need around 25 lakhs.

2:14:16.666 --> 2:14:17.500
When do you need it?

2:14:17.916 --> 2:14:20.250
Sir, whenever you give it, it's fine.

2:14:20.333 --> 2:14:22.166
Okay, as soon as possible.

2:14:23.583 --> 2:14:24.541
You will return it, right?

2:14:24.958 --> 2:14:25.875
What, sir!

2:14:27.041 --> 2:14:28.333
Just say you will return it!

2:14:29.083 --> 2:14:30.291
I'll surely return it, sir.

2:14:30.583 --> 2:14:34.333
Sorry, in fact, I did not want to ask you.

2:14:34.416 --> 2:14:37.625
Actually, you should say sorry
only for not buying a house till now.

2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:39.083
<i>I've asked you,</i>

2:14:39.166 --> 2:14:41.500
so many times why haven't
you bought a house yet.

2:14:42.166 --> 2:14:43.083
Yes, sir.

2:14:44.083 --> 2:14:45.416
Then, if not me,
who else will you ask?

2:14:45.708 --> 2:14:47.125
Okay, sir! Thank you, sir!

2:15:15.083 --> 2:15:17.000
Is this that "nameless" uncle's number?

2:15:18.291 --> 2:15:19.458
Why are you digging through that?

2:15:24.333 --> 2:15:28.166
Dad, please give me
your phone for a little while.

2:15:28.375 --> 2:15:29.416
Why?

2:15:30.083 --> 2:15:32.208
I want to call my friend.

2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:34.833
Here.

2:15:37.416 --> 2:15:38.500
Do you know the passcode?

2:15:38.750 --> 2:15:39.583
I know all that.

2:15:40.583 --> 2:15:41.583
Brat!

2:15:56.875 --> 2:15:58.375
Dad, there's a call!

2:15:59.166 --> 2:16:00.000
Who is it?

2:16:00.416 --> 2:16:01.375
I don't know, talk!

2:16:01.916 --> 2:16:02.791
Hello.

2:16:03.333 --> 2:16:04.250
<i>Live prosperously!</i>

2:16:04.375 --> 2:16:05.666
<i>Ezhil garments, tell me.</i>

2:16:08.666 --> 2:16:09.541
Talk!

2:16:11.875 --> 2:16:15.416
Hello, I am Arul, from Madras.

2:16:16.250 --> 2:16:17.083
<i>Athaan!</i>

2:16:17.666 --> 2:16:18.583
<i>Athaan!</i>

2:16:18.750 --> 2:16:19.875
How are you, <i>Athaan?</i>

2:16:20.250 --> 2:16:22.125
Just five minutes ago,
I was talking about you.

2:16:22.291 --> 2:16:23.666
<i>You'll live for 95 years!</i>

2:16:24.166 --> 2:16:25.000
<i>Your watch, right?</i>

2:16:25.458 --> 2:16:27.708
You left it in the bathroom.
I've kept it safely.

2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:29.458
I have also kept
your slippers safely in a bag.

2:16:30.041 --> 2:16:33.000
<i>What is this, Athaan? You just left</i>
<i>in anger, without even telling us.</i>

2:16:33.750 --> 2:16:35.708
<i>It's my Fault. I told you</i>
<i>to sleep but I slept off!</i>

2:16:36.375 --> 2:16:37.833
As soon as I woke up, I called you.

2:16:38.166 --> 2:16:39.500
Someone else answered the call.

2:16:40.125 --> 2:16:41.583
I tried again,

2:16:42.333 --> 2:16:44.125
<i>but the same person answered,</i>
<i>yelled at me, and hung up.</i>

2:16:44.541 --> 2:16:45.750
Then I asked Sokku uncle.

2:16:46.250 --> 2:16:47.125
He just shut me up, saying,

2:16:47.291 --> 2:16:48.458
"Stop troubling him.

2:16:48.583 --> 2:16:49.458
Is he a baby?

2:16:49.625 --> 2:16:51.208
Won't he know to go back himself?"

2:16:52.250 --> 2:16:54.041
I felt that I really troubled you.

2:16:55.791 --> 2:16:56.916
Whose number is this, <i>Athaan?</i>

2:16:58.541 --> 2:16:59.416
This is my number.

2:17:00.375 --> 2:17:01.333
How are you?

2:17:01.666 --> 2:17:02.958
Me? I am perfectly fine.

2:17:03.208 --> 2:17:04.208
So whose number is that?

2:17:05.541 --> 2:17:06.625
That…

2:17:07.750 --> 2:17:08.916
I gave you the wrong number.

2:17:09.375 --> 2:17:11.166
How can you go wrong
with your own number?

2:17:11.500 --> 2:17:13.500
I must have noted it down wrongly
since I was excited about the food.

2:17:15.833 --> 2:17:17.916
Actually, I want to ask you something.

2:17:18.541 --> 2:17:19.375
Tell me.

2:17:20.916 --> 2:17:22.166
I should have asked you
at Needamangalam, itself.

2:17:22.250 --> 2:17:23.125
But couldn't.

2:17:23.541 --> 2:17:25.916
I thought of asking you after coming here.

2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:30.541
But there was an emergency situation,
So, I had to arrange something.

2:17:31.583 --> 2:17:33.416
That's why I couldn't call earlier.

2:17:34.083 --> 2:17:35.083
Have you made arrangements?

2:17:37.458 --> 2:17:41.250
Sokku uncle told me that
you were in need of money,

2:17:41.416 --> 2:17:42.833
and you're running
around trying to arrange it.

2:17:42.916 --> 2:17:44.000
Have you made arrangements?

2:17:44.750 --> 2:17:46.458
Why did he tell you?

2:17:48.625 --> 2:17:49.833
I am not talking about that.

2:17:50.500 --> 2:17:52.791
<i>Athaan,</i> is everyone fine at home?

2:17:53.375 --> 2:17:54.291
No one's in trouble, right?

2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:57.250
No, no, everyone's fine.
It's not that kind of an emergency.

2:17:57.500 --> 2:18:01.125
We are trying to buy
the house we are currently residing in.

2:18:01.208 --> 2:18:03.583
I was busy making
arrangements for that.

2:18:04.166 --> 2:18:07.208
Thank god! I got worried
that it was something serious.

2:18:07.416 --> 2:18:09.625
To buy a house?
This is good news.

2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:11.916
When Sokku uncle told me,
I calculated and checked, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:13.666
I have 15 lakhs in cash ready with me.

2:18:15.041 --> 2:18:15.875
Look,

2:18:15.958 --> 2:18:18.000
I want to talk to you
about something else.

2:18:18.250 --> 2:18:19.416
It's definitely not about the money.

2:18:19.625 --> 2:18:22.083
Why? You can't call
and ask me for money?

2:18:22.250 --> 2:18:23.750
Then how will I repay for
all that you've done for me?

2:18:23.916 --> 2:18:25.375
When you gave us, didn't we take it?

2:18:25.458 --> 2:18:26.625
Now when we are giving it,
you should take it!

2:18:29.458 --> 2:18:30.291
See,

2:18:30.625 --> 2:18:32.541
I have 15 lakhs in cash ready with me.

2:18:32.750 --> 2:18:34.083
If we pledge the jewelry
we have in the bank…

2:18:34.166 --> 2:18:35.958
Don't pledge the jewelry,

2:18:36.041 --> 2:18:37.791
I am telling you I don't even
want the money and you're…

2:18:37.875 --> 2:18:39.791
Relax, <i>Athaan,</i> allow me to speak!

2:18:39.875 --> 2:18:41.791
Your sister is the one who
suggested we pledge the jewelry.

2:18:42.333 --> 2:18:44.583
If we pledge the jewelry in the bank,
we will get around five lakhs.

2:18:44.833 --> 2:18:47.083
For the balance five,
I can ask the chit-fund guys.

2:18:47.166 --> 2:18:48.666
If we tell them we require
it for an emergency,

2:18:48.750 --> 2:18:49.750
they will immediately give it.

2:18:49.958 --> 2:18:53.916
So, five and another five make it 25.
Is 25 enough, <i>Athaan?</i>

2:18:54.583 --> 2:18:57.333
<i>Athaan,</i> we can even ask for a loan
from the co-operative society.

2:18:58.375 --> 2:18:59.333
Thanks a lot.

2:18:59.791 --> 2:19:02.458
But I don't need it. I've already made
arrangements. Now just listen to me.

2:19:02.708 --> 2:19:04.666
After telling you all this, if you
still don't take the money from me,

2:19:04.750 --> 2:19:06.333
I'll never speak to you again.

2:19:08.041 --> 2:19:08.958
Okay, I'll take it.

2:19:10.875 --> 2:19:11.958
Now will you allow me to talk?

2:19:12.833 --> 2:19:13.750
Okay, tell me.

2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:21.958
I…

2:19:22.916 --> 2:19:23.791
You…

2:19:28.583 --> 2:19:30.208
I don't know where to start.

2:19:31.208 --> 2:19:32.125
What, <i>Athaan?</i>

2:19:33.791 --> 2:19:35.458
I gave you the wrong phone number.

2:19:37.541 --> 2:19:38.541
Wrong number?

2:19:39.708 --> 2:19:43.041
I purposely gave
you the wrong number.

2:19:43.583 --> 2:19:44.416
Why, <i>Athaan?</i>

2:19:46.250 --> 2:19:47.583
I don't know you.

2:19:48.875 --> 2:19:50.208
I don't know your name.

2:19:51.791 --> 2:19:54.000
I was thinking, "Why should I give
my number to a stranger?"

2:19:56.875 --> 2:19:57.958
That's why I gave the wrong one.

2:20:02.500 --> 2:20:03.375
Hello!

2:20:05.666 --> 2:20:06.541
Can you hear me?

2:20:06.791 --> 2:20:07.750
I can hear you, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:20:11.291 --> 2:20:12.708
Even now I don't know who you are.

2:20:15.666 --> 2:20:18.375
You went on calling me <i>Athaan</i>
with affection and a sense of belonging,

2:20:21.125 --> 2:20:22.166
I couldn't tell you…

2:20:22.500 --> 2:20:24.458
that… I don't know you.

2:20:25.708 --> 2:20:26.666
I just couldn't ask you.

2:20:28.333 --> 2:20:29.541
<i>Moreover, you were</i>
<i>with me all the time.</i>

2:20:31.916 --> 2:20:33.250
<i>So, I couldn't ask</i>
<i>anyone else as well.</i>

2:20:35.750 --> 2:20:38.333
An entire night at your house,

2:20:39.541 --> 2:20:41.333
without knowing who you were…

2:20:44.375 --> 2:20:45.583
I felt really bad.

2:20:49.083 --> 2:20:50.666
Like I had committed a big mistake.

2:20:53.375 --> 2:20:54.291
It definitely is…

2:20:56.541 --> 2:20:57.416
a big mistake.

2:21:01.250 --> 2:21:02.708
I managed to some extent,

2:21:06.583 --> 2:21:08.708
<i>but when you said you're going</i>
<i>to name your child after me,</i>

2:21:09.958 --> 2:21:11.708
And you said the next
morning I have to call

2:21:12.625 --> 2:21:14.791
all three of you by your
names and bless you…

2:21:15.333 --> 2:21:16.458
I froze!

2:21:21.833 --> 2:21:23.416
I couldn't handle your love,

2:21:25.375 --> 2:21:27.208
that's why without
even telling you,

2:21:28.333 --> 2:21:29.333
I ran away from the house.

2:21:33.375 --> 2:21:35.166
You, really don't know
who I am, <i>Athaan?</i>

2:21:38.750 --> 2:21:40.416
I may not know your name,

2:21:41.625 --> 2:21:43.416
I may have forgotten
how I am related to you,

2:21:45.625 --> 2:21:47.291
but I know who the real you is.

2:21:48.500 --> 2:21:49.375
<i>Forget that,</i>

2:21:51.333 --> 2:21:53.291
I figured out who I am
only because of you.

2:21:55.208 --> 2:21:56.083
This is the truth.

2:22:08.708 --> 2:22:10.041
Even now you don't know, <i>Athaan?</i>

2:22:13.750 --> 2:22:14.625
I don't know.

2:22:16.916 --> 2:22:17.791
Please forgive me.

2:22:18.666 --> 2:22:19.750
Don't say all that, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:22:21.791 --> 2:22:23.625
Just a minute, just a minute, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:22:31.375 --> 2:22:32.208
Hello!

2:22:35.208 --> 2:22:36.083
Hey!

2:22:36.916 --> 2:22:37.791
Are you crying?

2:22:42.708 --> 2:22:43.666
Forget it, it's alright.

2:22:45.250 --> 2:22:46.666
I made a huge mistake,

2:22:48.041 --> 2:22:48.958
forgive me.

2:22:50.416 --> 2:22:51.791
Don't say all that, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:22:52.583 --> 2:22:54.500
At least now you
felt like finding out.

2:22:55.583 --> 2:22:56.416
Do you really want to?

2:22:58.125 --> 2:22:59.583
I feel like hearing it from you.

2:22:59.958 --> 2:23:02.500
You might be busy,
let's talk later, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:23:03.583 --> 2:23:05.291
There is no work more
important than this.

2:23:05.833 --> 2:23:06.916
Please tell me.

2:23:07.666 --> 2:23:08.875
Tell me, you have forgiven me.

2:23:09.333 --> 2:23:10.208
I'll tell you that,

2:23:10.541 --> 2:23:13.083
but you should promise
to come here again and see me.

2:23:15.166 --> 2:23:17.541
I promise I'll come, dear.
I'll come tomorrow itself.

2:23:18.041 --> 2:23:19.416
Please tell me
you've forgiven me.

2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:21.750
Don't say such big words, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:23:23.083 --> 2:23:24.333
I might just die.

2:23:25.583 --> 2:23:26.833
Just say you've forgiven me.

2:23:27.333 --> 2:23:29.125
You too forgive me, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:23:29.750 --> 2:23:30.625
Why?

2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:32.958
I knew that the bus which
was going to Chennai,

2:23:33.791 --> 2:23:35.708
was leaving at 09:00 p.m., <i>Athaan.</i>

2:23:36.625 --> 2:23:37.666
Despite that,

2:23:38.125 --> 2:23:40.791
if you had left then, I wasn't sure
when you would come again.

2:23:41.625 --> 2:23:43.833
I wanted you to see
Bhuvana's wedding

2:23:44.208 --> 2:23:46.666
<i>and wished for you</i>
<i>to stay with me for a day.</i>

2:23:47.375 --> 2:23:48.750
<i>So what was to be 09:00 p.m.,</i>

2:23:49.625 --> 2:23:52.375
I made it 10:00 p.m.
I told you a tiny lie, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:23:53.041 --> 2:23:54.250
It wasn't planned, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:23:54.333 --> 2:23:55.250
At that moment…

2:23:56.375 --> 2:23:57.250
Hey!

2:23:58.500 --> 2:24:01.583
You can lie about your phone number,
can't I lie about the bus timing?

2:24:01.666 --> 2:24:03.041
Why one set of rules for you
and another set of rules for me?

2:24:03.375 --> 2:24:04.458
Now it's fair and square.

2:24:04.541 --> 2:24:05.583
I'll also forgive you.

2:24:06.208 --> 2:24:07.791
Okay, I will spare you.

2:24:08.666 --> 2:24:09.666
Now tell me your name.

2:24:11.958 --> 2:24:12.916
Do you remember…

2:24:13.375 --> 2:24:15.291
your summer holidays of '94?

2:24:15.458 --> 2:24:16.500
Your tenth-grade vacation?

2:24:17.541 --> 2:24:19.458
I don't remember anything
much about the past.

2:24:19.625 --> 2:24:21.208
But you go on,
I may remember as you narrate.

2:24:21.750 --> 2:24:25.541
Okay, I'll come to that later.
First, I'll tell you who I am.

2:24:25.875 --> 2:24:26.708
Okay.

2:24:27.916 --> 2:24:29.250
I am no big star like
Rajinikanth or Kamal Haasan,

2:24:29.333 --> 2:24:30.666
to tell you about myself in one word.

2:24:30.750 --> 2:24:32.791
It will be slightly elaborate,
is that okay?

2:24:33.041 --> 2:24:34.041
Okay, now just tell me!

2:24:35.375 --> 2:24:36.958
Your mother's mother,

2:24:37.375 --> 2:24:38.750
who is from Kumbakonam,

2:24:39.125 --> 2:24:41.333
was born with three siblings.

2:24:42.333 --> 2:24:43.166
Hello!

2:24:43.750 --> 2:24:44.833
I am listening.

2:24:45.083 --> 2:24:46.208
Make some sounds
of acknowledgment, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:24:46.500 --> 2:24:48.125
Only then will I have
the interest to narrate.

2:24:52.333 --> 2:24:56.625
So, your late great-grandparents,
Maruthamuthu and Jagadambal,

2:24:56.708 --> 2:24:57.958
had four children.

2:24:58.166 --> 2:25:01.166
Sivagnanam, Janagam, Gopu,
and Padma. Am I right?

2:25:03.125 --> 2:25:04.833
Janagam is your grandmother.

2:25:05.083 --> 2:25:07.833
Your mother, your uncle,
and all your aunts were born to her.

2:25:09.208 --> 2:25:10.333
Hey, I know all that.

2:25:10.458 --> 2:25:12.375
Wow! Not bad!

2:25:12.750 --> 2:25:15.333
So, Janagam granny's brother,
Sivagnanam grandpa,

2:25:15.458 --> 2:25:17.041
had four children.

2:25:17.416 --> 2:25:21.000
Paneerselvam, Angamma,
Banumathy and Vijayalakshmi.

2:25:21.291 --> 2:25:23.833
That Angamma is my mother.

2:25:25.125 --> 2:25:26.000
Superb.

2:25:26.458 --> 2:25:27.416
Now will you tell me your name?

2:25:27.625 --> 2:25:29.833
Wait! I've only told
you half of the story.

2:25:30.416 --> 2:25:32.083
Now let's start again from the beginning.

2:25:32.958 --> 2:25:36.333
Your mother's father,
as in, your grandfather's there, right?

2:25:37.458 --> 2:25:38.333
He "was" there.

2:25:39.041 --> 2:25:39.875
Is that so?

2:25:40.458 --> 2:25:43.166
Okay, your grandfather
was born with six siblings.

2:25:43.458 --> 2:25:44.666
One of them was Gurunathar.

2:25:45.166 --> 2:25:47.250
That Gurunathar had three kids.

2:25:47.500 --> 2:25:49.833
Santhanam, Kanakavalli,
and Loganathan.

2:25:50.250 --> 2:25:51.958
That Santhanam is my father.

2:25:52.625 --> 2:25:53.500
Okay.

2:25:53.875 --> 2:25:59.625
Your granny was the matchmaker
who got them married.

2:26:00.125 --> 2:26:01.000
Superb.

2:26:01.291 --> 2:26:03.375
My brother and I were born to them.

2:26:03.708 --> 2:26:05.250
Now at least you can
tell me your name, right?

2:26:05.708 --> 2:26:06.666
It's not like you'll lose anything!

2:26:07.083 --> 2:26:07.958
Wait, hang on!

2:26:08.125 --> 2:26:09.666
We are almost there,
just a little bit more to go.

2:26:10.291 --> 2:26:13.333
Now let's go back to '94.

2:26:16.833 --> 2:26:20.541
I can never forget that year
for many reasons, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:26:21.208 --> 2:26:23.500
<i>For the first time, we traveled</i>
<i>outside Needamangalam.</i>

2:26:23.750 --> 2:26:25.791
<i>For the first time, we had</i>
<i>gotten into an outstation bus.</i>

2:26:26.041 --> 2:26:29.083
<i>For the first time, we were</i>
<i>coming to Thanjavur to your house.</i>

2:26:29.666 --> 2:26:31.250
<i>All through the journey,</i>
<i>my father advised me,</i>

2:26:31.458 --> 2:26:34.500
<i>"You shouldn't shout, nor fight,</i>
<i>nor dig your nose,</i>

2:26:34.583 --> 2:26:36.250
<i>nor talk in the village dialect."</i>

2:26:36.333 --> 2:26:38.041
<i>He was laying down so many</i>
<i>conditions while coming there.</i>

2:26:38.500 --> 2:26:41.125
At that time, you had just finished
your tenth grade and were confused,

2:26:41.208 --> 2:26:44.291
about whether to join polytechnic college
or complete your 11th and 12th grade.

2:26:44.833 --> 2:26:47.041
<i>But you used to always call</i>
<i>me aside and talk to me.</i>

2:26:47.458 --> 2:26:49.291
<i>Wherever you went,</i>
<i>you took me along.</i>

2:26:50.583 --> 2:26:53.166
<i>You used to play with</i>
<i>us kids, at our level.</i>

2:26:53.958 --> 2:26:55.791
<i>You used to teach</i>
<i>us a lot of new things.</i>

2:26:57.041 --> 2:26:59.458
<i>You weren't like this then,</i>
<i>you used to always be cheerful.</i>

2:27:01.375 --> 2:27:03.125
You used to talk to everyone so kindly.

2:27:03.625 --> 2:27:05.291
I learned that from you, <i>Athaan.</i>

2:27:05.916 --> 2:27:06.916
Really?

2:27:07.583 --> 2:27:08.625
Was I like that?

2:27:09.291 --> 2:27:10.458
I swear on you!

2:27:10.666 --> 2:27:11.625
Oh, no! I believe you.

2:27:12.041 --> 2:27:12.916
See, finally,

2:27:13.375 --> 2:27:14.416
not just about you,

2:27:14.708 --> 2:27:16.583
but I have even found out
about myself from you.

2:27:20.916 --> 2:27:22.958
You're the one who first
took me to a cinema theater.

2:27:23.041 --> 2:27:25.958
<i>At Kumaran Cinema Theater, we saw the</i>
<i>matinee show of</i> Veetla Visheshanga.

2:27:26.125 --> 2:27:29.458
<i>Even though you had already</i>
<i>seen it, you took us again.</i>

2:27:30.166 --> 2:27:32.333
<i>How I wasn't tall enough and</i>
<i>used to keep adjusting to see the film.</i>

2:27:32.875 --> 2:27:35.416
<i>How you got us ice cream</i>
<i>and popcorn during the interval.</i>

2:27:35.708 --> 2:27:37.083
<i>The smell of the cinema theater,</i>

2:27:37.500 --> 2:27:38.916
<i>I can't forget anything, Athaan!</i>

2:27:40.041 --> 2:27:41.208
<i>Even now when I think about it…</i>

2:27:42.875 --> 2:27:45.208
But I am not able to figure out
whether I actually remember,

2:27:45.291 --> 2:27:47.083
or because you're narrating
I am imagining that I remember.

2:27:48.125 --> 2:27:50.541
Okay, listen, this is
the most important part.

2:27:50.833 --> 2:27:54.041
<i>There were eight of us, all small kids.</i>

2:27:54.458 --> 2:27:56.250
<i>Unable to manage</i>
<i>all of us at home…</i>

2:27:56.333 --> 2:27:59.333
<i>They sent us with you to the market.</i>

2:27:59.416 --> 2:28:01.166
<i>All of us would hold hands and follow you.</i>

2:28:01.291 --> 2:28:03.750
We used to compete amongst ourselves
to hold your hand.

2:28:06.125 --> 2:28:07.083
Okay.

2:28:07.458 --> 2:28:10.166
To keep us under control you used to
do something till we reached the shop,

2:28:10.250 --> 2:28:12.291
do you remember what that was?

2:28:12.791 --> 2:28:14.541
No, what was it?

2:28:14.708 --> 2:28:17.416
You'd name each one
of us after a vegetable.

2:28:17.958 --> 2:28:20.416
And till we reached the shop
we had to keep repeating,

2:28:20.500 --> 2:28:23.000
how much of that vegetable
we were going to buy.

2:28:23.083 --> 2:28:24.000
Cabbage, one kilo,

2:28:24.083 --> 2:28:26.375
-What vegetable are you?
-Potato, two kilos.

2:28:26.791 --> 2:28:27.708
The last one?

2:28:27.791 --> 2:28:29.333
Small Onion, three kilos.

2:28:35.458 --> 2:28:37.000
Green Chili for five rupees.

2:28:37.083 --> 2:28:38.166
Ladyfinger, one kilo.

2:28:38.250 --> 2:28:39.500
Like this, we would keep
repeating it and walking.

2:28:39.916 --> 2:28:40.875
In that group,

2:28:41.375 --> 2:28:43.791
Priya was the Green Chili,

2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:44.916
and Ganesh was?

2:28:45.666 --> 2:28:46.541
Beans!

2:28:46.750 --> 2:28:48.916
That's more like it!
You remember now.

2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:50.833
Meena's name was Big Onion.

2:28:50.916 --> 2:28:52.875
Ranji's name was Small Onion.

2:28:53.375 --> 2:28:55.250
Yes, Ramya was Ladyfinger,

2:28:55.708 --> 2:28:57.000
and Saravanan was Turkey Berry.

2:28:57.666 --> 2:28:58.625
Bhuvana? Balamurali?

2:28:59.958 --> 2:29:02.875
Bhuvana was Tomato, no,
Balamurali was Tomato.

2:29:03.250 --> 2:29:04.208
Bhuvana…

2:29:07.291 --> 2:29:08.208
Bhuvana…

2:29:08.291 --> 2:29:09.166
Shall I tell you?

2:29:09.500 --> 2:29:11.208
No, no, don't. I will remember it.

2:29:11.375 --> 2:29:12.666
Okay, countdown from one to five.

2:29:13.875 --> 2:29:15.083
One…

2:29:15.583 --> 2:29:17.291
-Wait.
<i>-Two.</i>

2:29:17.541 --> 2:29:20.041
-Bhuvana was…
<i>-Three.</i>

2:29:20.541 --> 2:29:21.625
Give me a clue.

2:29:21.791 --> 2:29:24.125
You can eat that as a vegetable
and as a fruit.

2:29:25.541 --> 2:29:26.500
Capsicum?

2:29:26.666 --> 2:29:28.958
Wrong. Four.

2:29:29.166 --> 2:29:30.541
<i>Four and one-fourth…</i>

2:29:30.958 --> 2:29:32.166
<i>Four and a half…</i>

2:29:32.416 --> 2:29:33.833
-Bhuvana…
<i>-Four and three-fourths…</i>

2:29:33.916 --> 2:29:35.666
Plantain! Bhuvana was Plantain.

2:29:35.833 --> 2:29:37.333
Superb, <i>Athaan!</i>

2:29:37.958 --> 2:29:39.250
Oh, man!

2:29:40.208 --> 2:29:41.416
Not done yet.

2:29:41.750 --> 2:29:42.875
Who was Cabbage?

2:29:43.666 --> 2:29:46.250
Wait, I know. Cabbage was…

2:29:47.083 --> 2:29:48.708
that person's son…

2:29:49.208 --> 2:29:50.750
I forgot his name.

2:29:52.250 --> 2:29:54.000
Come on, you're pretty close.

2:29:55.916 --> 2:29:58.166
That boy had a lovely name.

2:29:58.916 --> 2:30:00.166
He also had two whorls on his head.

2:30:00.458 --> 2:30:04.583
His name was Madhi… Madhi!

2:30:05.916 --> 2:30:06.875
Madhiyazhagan.

2:30:08.541 --> 2:30:10.625
Madhiyazhagan was Cabbage. Yes!

2:30:11.708 --> 2:30:12.791
I wonder how he is now.

2:30:13.208 --> 2:30:15.375
Nothing to worry about.
He's absolutely fine.

2:30:16.500 --> 2:30:18.500
You remember Cabbage,

2:30:18.833 --> 2:30:21.125
but you don't remember his
elder brother, Potato, right?

2:30:21.500 --> 2:30:22.416
You are so mean, <i>Athaan!</i>

2:30:35.458 --> 2:30:36.333
Hey!

2:30:37.333 --> 2:30:38.208
Potato!

2:30:40.416 --> 2:30:41.458
Hey! Potato!

2:30:43.500 --> 2:30:44.375
Is it you?

2:30:45.750 --> 2:30:46.666
Is it you?

2:30:48.208 --> 2:30:49.541
Finally!

2:30:49.958 --> 2:30:51.625
What a tube light you are, <i>Athaan!</i>

2:30:54.250 --> 2:30:55.541
Hey, Potato!

2:30:56.250 --> 2:30:58.625
That's me! Your Potato.

2:31:00.583 --> 2:31:01.916
How are you?

2:31:02.916 --> 2:31:04.666
Yeah, right! I am fine.

2:31:05.250 --> 2:31:09.125
After talking for so long, now
you're asking me how I am? How silly!

2:31:09.750 --> 2:31:11.291
Forgive me, forgive me!

2:31:11.875 --> 2:31:15.333
Okay, now tell me my name.
I'll forgive you.

2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:19.041
Potato, that's it.

2:31:19.875 --> 2:31:21.458
Look at how you are dodging even now!

2:31:21.916 --> 2:31:23.250
That's the name you gave me.

2:31:23.750 --> 2:31:25.458
I am asking you about
the name my parents gave me.

2:31:32.083 --> 2:31:34.250
I won't tell you.
You never made it easy either, right?

2:31:35.208 --> 2:31:36.250
Look how you prolonged it!

2:31:37.291 --> 2:31:38.958
You can only tell it if you know it!

2:31:40.041 --> 2:31:42.250
You remember my brother's name,

2:31:42.333 --> 2:31:43.833
but you don’t remember my name, do you?

2:31:44.250 --> 2:31:45.541
Who said I don't remember?

2:31:46.250 --> 2:31:47.541
It's been a minute since I remembered.

2:31:48.375 --> 2:31:49.500
Then behave yourself and tell me my name.

2:31:49.583 --> 2:31:50.583
If you don't, I won't give you money.

2:31:50.708 --> 2:31:51.666
Then don't.

2:31:51.750 --> 2:31:52.583
Did I ask you for it?

2:31:52.666 --> 2:31:53.708
You were the one who said you'd give.

2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:56.666
Yes, exactly. I will give it to you,
and you have to take it.

2:31:57.000 --> 2:31:59.291
That's my share for your house.
How can you refuse it?

2:31:59.416 --> 2:32:00.500
Okay, give it.

2:32:01.125 --> 2:32:01.958
I'll take it.

2:32:02.041 --> 2:32:03.416
I'll take anything
you give me from now on.

2:32:03.708 --> 2:32:06.250
That's right! That's my <i>Athaan!</i>

2:32:06.625 --> 2:32:07.916
Okay, now tell me my name.

2:32:08.791 --> 2:32:09.666
I won't tell you now.

2:32:10.916 --> 2:32:11.833
If not now, then when?

2:32:13.166 --> 2:32:14.166
Later.

2:32:14.750 --> 2:32:15.708
When?

2:32:16.041 --> 2:32:16.958
Hey!

2:32:17.416 --> 2:32:20.375
I'll tell you!
Hang up, you Potato.

2:32:43.833 --> 2:32:44.750
NEEDAMANGALAM

2:32:57.708 --> 2:32:58.666
Come, brother.

2:32:58.916 --> 2:32:59.791
Do you remember me?

2:33:04.041 --> 2:33:04.958
Just do an offering.

2:33:05.125 --> 2:33:06.083
In God's name?

2:33:35.791 --> 2:33:36.708
Potato!

2:33:37.833 --> 2:33:38.875
Potato!

2:33:41.708 --> 2:33:42.666
Potato!

2:33:43.833 --> 2:33:44.750
Hey, Potato!

2:33:44.916 --> 2:33:45.833
Open the door.

2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:49.875
Hey!

2:33:50.208 --> 2:33:52.333
Enough now! I can't take it anymore!

2:33:52.791 --> 2:33:53.916
Open the door.

2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:00.541
I know you're on the other side
of the door.

2:34:01.833 --> 2:34:03.875
Hey! Don't torture me, rascal!

2:34:05.333 --> 2:34:06.291
Open the door!

2:34:10.125 --> 2:34:12.708
Open the door, Meiyazhagan!

2:34:25.375 --> 2:34:26.541
<i>Athaan!</i>

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:06.166
This moment and this journey were
neither anticipated.

2
00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:07.625
nor planned by me.

3
00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:11.291
My destiny has decided my destination.

4
00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:14.583
It sends me to a place where I thought
I would never go again in my life.

5
00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:21.875
To tell you why I am going there
or where I am going.

6
00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:24.416
I have to first tell you
where my journey started.

7
00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:27.083
Raghudevapuram. my hometown.

8
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:29.416
Growing crops without the use
of fertilizers.

9
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.625
feeding others without expecting
any profits…

10
00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:33.833
has been the work of the family
for generations.

11
00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:37.166
-Bhuvaneswari. did brother eat?
-Yes. He is gone to the field.

12
00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:39.875
-Kotayya. give that to me. I'll serve.
-Yes?

13
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.166
Is that the way to serve someone?

14
00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:43.208
Shall I put some more gravy?

15
00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:44.458
It's okay. madam. Enough.

16
00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:48.375
Thank you. Uncle.

17
00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:49.291
Me.

18
00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:50.333
-sister-in-law…
-Delicious food.

19
00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:51.250
and my uncle…

20
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:52.500
are my brother's army.

21
00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:56.708
But as they say. good and bad
are like yin and yang. They co-exist.

22
00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:59.458
In our village. the name
of that bad is Paparao.

23
00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:00.833
The owner of the opposite hotel.

24
00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:02.041
THANK YOU

25
00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:04.375
Rajaram…

26
00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:07.041
what are you doing?

27
00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:09.625
If we are running our hotel
with lakhs of rupees.

28
00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:13.583
and you are giving away food for 10 rupees
and 20 rupees as you give to beggars.

29
00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:15.875
What's the matter with you?
What are those prices?

30
00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.125
What are these rates?

31
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.583
Paparao!

32
00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:22.500
Until you change these rates…

33
00:05:25.583 --> 00:05:26.500
Paparao!

34
00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:29.416
I will keep this license with me.

35
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.291
Until then you won't be able
to run this hotel.

36
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.666
Take action to prevent it
from happening again.

37
00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:42.125
-Namaste.
-Sure.

38
00:05:42.416 --> 00:05:43.250
Come. Uncle.

39
00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:45.875
Rajaram has filed a complaint it seems.

40
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:49.333
Here. I am using his complaint letter
as tissue paper.

41
00:05:55.875 --> 00:06:00.250
From Rajaram to the honorable inspector.

42
00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:07.333
At around 2:00 p.m..
when I was serving my organic meal.

43
00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:09.958
Paparao forcibly took away my license.

44
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.083
-Hey!
-Who is it?

45
00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:18.791
Who is this? Catch him.

46
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:19.791
Who is it?

47
00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:23.000
Clean properly.
Customers will arrive soon.

48
00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:24.583
-Mr. Rajaram…
-Why have you come here. Chanti?

49
00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:27.166
The SI asked you to bring
your brother to the station.

50
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:28.666
What did he do again?

51
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.541
Paparao's house was set on fire at night.

52
00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:32.416
Did he set it on fire?

53
00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:40.125
Okay. I'll get him. Go on.

54
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.416
Okay. sir.

55
00:06:45.708 --> 00:06:46.583
Nice!

56
00:06:47.166 --> 00:06:48.000
-Dear.
-Brother.

57
00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:49.375
-Bhuvaneswari.
-Brother. what happened?

58
00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:50.416
Brother.

59
00:06:50.666 --> 00:06:52.541
Let me go. brother.
Brother. let me go.

60
00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.375
You made the same mistake
that Paparao made.

61
00:06:54.458 --> 00:06:56.958
What's wrong with getting our license?

62
00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:58.250
There's a right way to do it.

63
00:06:58.458 --> 00:06:59.750
There's a law and the police in place.

64
00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:01.875
The police are also supporting Paparao.

65
00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.541
If so. then go to court.

66
00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:07.500
An eye for an eye makes
the whole world blind.

67
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.541
If it has to stop with this.
you have to go to the police station

68
00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:11.125
and get an appropriate punishment.

69
00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:12.583
However. Paparao needs to be punished.

70
00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:15.250
Why are you talking back to me?

71
00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:16.166
Vicky!

72
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.416
All these words can be spoken
by anyone of your age.

73
00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:20.833
To achieve something.
your eyes have to be on the ground.

74
00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:21.833
You have to keep your tongue
under control.

75
00:07:21.916 --> 00:07:23.083
Your behavior should garner respect.

76
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:25.583
If not. you can't achieve
anything in your life.

77
00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:28.250
You're also following all this. brother.

78
00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:29.333
What have you accomplished?

79
00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:31.458
You can achieve it
only if you are like me.

80
00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:32.666
What have you achieved?

81
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.958
Police complaints and fights?!

82
00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:35.333
If that's the case.
you won't be with us for long.

83
00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:36.875
-Come. let's go to the police station.
-Let me go. brother.

84
00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.291
Once you get punished. you don't change.

85
00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:46.208
Vicky.

86
00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:50.041
Brother. I'll come back home only
after I have achieved something.

87
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.375
Vicky!

88
00:07:58.833 --> 00:07:59.916
Hey. stop!

89
00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:05.333
Vicky!

90
00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:08.750
Vicky.

91
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.875
Bhuvanamma! Vicky ran away.

92
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.666
The train I boarded that day
took me to Kolkata.

93
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:38.208
There was not a single penny in my pocket.

94
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.708
but I had the courage that
I would survive anyway.

95
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.791
Here's your dhokla.

96
00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:47.291
-Okay.
-Can I get one more?

97
00:08:47.375 --> 00:08:48.958
You guys are here already?

98
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.083
Come.

99
00:08:50.166 --> 00:08:53.250
-Uncle. give them something to eat.
-Okay. Bhai.

100
00:08:53.416 --> 00:08:55.541
Anji. give them something to eat.

101
00:08:58.333 --> 00:09:00.833
Uncle. call him to eat as well.

102
00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:02.041
Hey. kid!

103
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.083
Come here.

104
00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.708
-Eat this.
-I have no money.

105
00:09:09.791 --> 00:09:11.750
Eat this first and you can work later.

106
00:09:11.875 --> 00:09:13.208
Tell me what's the work.
I'll eat only after completing it.

107
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:15.750
What's the difference between
eating before and eating after?

108
00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:17.375
If I eat first. it's your alms.

109
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.625
If I eat later. that means I've earned it.

110
00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:21.583
I don't want to live on alms from someone.

111
00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:23.583
Well said.

112
00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:25.416
You seem to be a Telugu guy.

113
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.875
Will you work for me?

114
00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.666
I will work. But not for you.
I will work with you.

115
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.208
I like you.

116
00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:34.666
I need someone like you.

117
00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.500
Come on.

118
00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:42.791
I got the son I wanted.

119
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.416
Then Kolkata was in the arms
of a don named Mukherjee.

120
00:09:56.625 --> 00:10:01.208
Facing Mukherjee. Gupta set out to
bid for a contract with two crore rupees.

121
00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:04.708
Mukherjee's men tried
to stop him from bidding.

122
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:08.250
If anyone were to step forward bravely.
they would risk losing their life.

123
00:10:27.125 --> 00:10:27.958
Son.

124
00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:48.250
Son.

125
00:11:08.708 --> 00:11:10.375
Mr. Gupta. if you want the tender.

126
00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:12.791
you have to pay the money
within five minutes.

127
00:11:13.041 --> 00:11:14.208
Oh no!

128
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.083
Hey. Gupta.

129
00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:20.125
Are you still hopeful
that your guy will come?

130
00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:23.791
If he can swim. then he must
have fled with your money.

131
00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:26.000
If he doesn't. then he'll probably drown
and die.

132
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.541
I've told you so many times.

133
00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:33.583
No one can step into my business empire

134
00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:35.916
in this port while I'm there.

135
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.875
Wrong!

136
00:11:39.416 --> 00:11:40.750
There's my son.

137
00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:53.333
Two crores.

138
00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:55.625
Hey!

139
00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:56.875
What did you say?

140
00:11:57.375 --> 00:11:59.291
"No one can."

141
00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:03.291
Look. My young partner.

142
00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:05.041
My lion.

143
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.541
Remember.

144
00:12:08.458 --> 00:12:13.583
This is the first step to your downfall.

145
00:12:14.916 --> 00:12:15.791
Let's go.

146
00:12:20.166 --> 00:12:22.125
Brother. don't let him go.

147
00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:23.750
Shut up!

148
00:12:24.916 --> 00:12:26.000
He's just a kid.

149
00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:43.833
No. let us--

150
00:12:56.833 --> 00:13:03.000
It's a roar that defies all directions

151
00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:09.541
Come like a dawn that is boundless

152
00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:15.958
You are the lightning that beholds
Scorching heat within it

153
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:22.333
Come like a battle
That uplifts your character

154
00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:25.541
Is there a weapon that asks
For right and wrong advice?

155
00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:28.625
Will there be a war that knows
The difference between good and bad?

156
00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:35.250
Will your difficulties be solved if you
Ignore the problems or beg for solutions?

157
00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:43.833
He is an unparalleled fighter in the ring

158
00:13:44.166 --> 00:13:50.333
He is an armed soldier

159
00:13:57.083 --> 00:13:58.041
Bhai!

160
00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:01.750
That Vicky has entered
into imports-exports.

161
00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:04.041
and all other contracts in our port area.

162
00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:08.041
I urged everyone to kill him
when he was a kid.

163
00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:09.625
but nobody listened to me.

164
00:14:09.708 --> 00:14:11.250
You let him go without killing him.

165
00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:23.000
Finally. Mukherjee's son tried
to win me over by using Gupta.

166
00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:26.375
Do you need my help now?

167
00:14:26.541 --> 00:14:29.791
So far. he didn't care about anyone
because he had Vicky's support.

168
00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:33.916
and he entered all our businesses.

169
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.375
Hey!

170
00:14:37.416 --> 00:14:39.166
Now who will stand for you?

171
00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:18.958
He is dead.

172
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:09.000
He is dead.

173
00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:14.750
Your time's up. Mukherjee.

174
00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:17.416
Remember? His name is Vicky.

175
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.916
I had told you. this guy is a bad boy!

176
00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:24.458
This is the last chapter
of your autobiography.

177
00:17:24.541 --> 00:17:25.583
Finish!

178
00:17:36.083 --> 00:17:38.125
I earned a lot of money and status

179
00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:41.875
just because my brother had demeaned me
by saying that I could achieve nothing.

180
00:17:43.916 --> 00:17:47.625
During that time. Bhairavi showed me love.

181
00:17:57.791 --> 00:18:02.791
You are my first love
I chased you until I found you

182
00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:06.625
And then began the love melody in my heart

183
00:18:07.125 --> 00:18:11.583
You are the personification of the sketch

184
00:18:12.166 --> 00:18:17.000
Sketched by both Picasso
And Da Vinci combined

185
00:18:17.083 --> 00:18:21.208
I have gone crazy
I have forgotten myself

186
00:18:21.291 --> 00:18:22.166
I am no more myself

187
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:27.541
I am following you
Leaving everything behind

188
00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:32.458
It's you! It's you!
Who looks like a flower bouquet

189
00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:37.000
But stabs my heart with a knife

190
00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:42.375
It's you! It's you!
Who sounds like a soothing noise

191
00:18:42.458 --> 00:18:45.916
But shoots bullets at my heart

192
00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:52.250
You are my first love
I chased you until I found you

193
00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:55.875
And then began the love melody in my heart

194
00:18:56.625 --> 00:19:01.041
You are the personification of the sketch

195
00:19:01.583 --> 00:19:06.708
Sketched by both Picasso
And Da Vinci combined

196
00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:12.083
It's you! It's you!
Who looks like a flower bouquet

197
00:19:12.166 --> 00:19:16.583
But stabs my heart with a knife

198
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.916
It's you! It's you!
Who sounds like a soothing noise

199
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.458
But shoots bullets at my heart

200
00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:51.666
The full moon calls me every day

201
00:19:52.166 --> 00:19:56.666
Asking me to tell the whereabouts
Of her moonlight

202
00:19:57.166 --> 00:20:02.000
Even though you are in front of me
I never tell about you

203
00:20:02.083 --> 00:20:06.208
Because I want you to be with me lifelong

204
00:20:06.291 --> 00:20:10.833
My heart! My heart!
Listens to me no more

205
00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:15.666
An unknown bond with you
Makes me fall in love with you

206
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:20.791
My heart dances to this new romantic beat

207
00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:26.250
This is new for me!

208
00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:31.208
It's you! It's you!
Who looks like a flower bouquet

209
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:35.708
But stabs my heart with a knife

210
00:20:36.166 --> 00:20:41.083
It's you! It's you!
Who sounds like a soothing noise

211
00:20:41.166 --> 00:20:44.666
But shoots bullets at my heart

212
00:21:10.375 --> 00:21:13.541
Bhairavi told us that you two are in love.

213
00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:17.708
Look. son. two people are enough
to fall in love.

214
00:21:18.458 --> 00:21:21.916
But a family is needed for a marriage
to take place.

215
00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:25.833
If you could tell me where your house is.
I'll talk to your elders.

216
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.833
He doesn't have to stay
at somebody else's house. sir.

217
00:21:27.916 --> 00:21:29.666
He owns a five-star hotel.

218
00:21:29.791 --> 00:21:30.750
We all stay there.

219
00:21:30.833 --> 00:21:33.250
Our boss's office and house
are both that five-star hotel.

220
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.208
This is about it!

221
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:38.708
Sir does not even have a house. but
he came hoping to ask for the bride.

222
00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:39.625
Boss…

223
00:21:40.125 --> 00:21:40.958
Hey.

224
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.166
House isn't a big deal. sir.

225
00:21:42.416 --> 00:21:44.083
I'm not married yet
so I didn't bother about it.

226
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:46.166
Tell me which area you want in Kolkata.

227
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.416
By tomorrow morning the house will
be ready. along with the registration.

228
00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:52.208
Dear. a house is not built with bricks.
but with people.

229
00:21:52.333 --> 00:21:54.041
If you have money.
you can become a rich man.

230
00:21:54.708 --> 00:21:57.333
But if you have a family.
it can give you strength and support.

231
00:21:58.625 --> 00:22:00.750
Sir. who lives as a joint family
these days?

232
00:22:00.833 --> 00:22:02.625
They are getting separated from
the family soon after they get married?

233
00:22:02.708 --> 00:22:03.625
Wrong.

234
00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:07.208
There are many people with golden plates
who can't eat a satiating meal.

235
00:22:07.666 --> 00:22:12.458
many who own silk beds
but can't get a peaceful sleep.

236
00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:15.458
Do you know why?

237
00:22:16.041 --> 00:22:18.375
Because they don't have a family

238
00:22:18.583 --> 00:22:20.833
that can celebrate their victory
or comfort their suffering.

239
00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.750
So. no matter how many crores you have

240
00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:27.083
when you don't have a family.
you're still poor.

241
00:22:28.458 --> 00:22:32.000
No matter how many servants you have.
you're still an orphan.

242
00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:39.375
We don't want to give our daughter
to an orphan like you.

243
00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:48.541
I am not an orphan.

244
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.458
I have a family as well.

245
00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:52.708
Really?

246
00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:55.208
You said that you are alone.
If you have a family. why is that?

247
00:22:58.166 --> 00:22:59.416
When I was a child.

248
00:23:00.083 --> 00:23:01.250
I got into a fight and left the house.

249
00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:04.041
Every family has conflicts.

250
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.958
We also get into fights.

251
00:23:06.416 --> 00:23:08.250
But we'll be back together
the next moment.

252
00:23:08.666 --> 00:23:10.666
That “we” is the family.

253
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:13.625
Look. my dear.

254
00:23:14.333 --> 00:23:16.333
The blood relations can get separated.

255
00:23:16.791 --> 00:23:17.708
but can't be severed.

256
00:23:19.916 --> 00:23:21.625
If our daughter has
to come to your house.

257
00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:23.750
we need to talk to your family.

258
00:23:27.125 --> 00:23:28.083
That's it!

259
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:31.708
It has been 14 years
since I left my family.

260
00:23:32.375 --> 00:23:35.000
When they ask me why I didn't come
for so many years.

261
00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:38.791
I may not be able to answer them.

262
00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:40.916
My brother believes

263
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.541
that it is wrong to beat even those
who have done injustice to us.

264
00:23:43.083 --> 00:23:45.583
Then how can I tell my brother
what I have done in Kolkata to grow up?

265
00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:04.125
I am going with the belief…

266
00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:06.583
that the parents will forgive
their son for any mistake.

267
00:24:33.666 --> 00:24:38.291
AMRUTA NILAYAM

268
00:24:52.916 --> 00:24:53.750
Brother.

269
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.541
After 14 years.
feels like my life has returned.

270
00:26:43.083 --> 00:26:45.583
There is not a single day when
I didn't pray to God for your return.

271
00:26:46.916 --> 00:26:49.083
Dear Janani. what are you looking at?

272
00:26:49.166 --> 00:26:50.083
He is your uncle.

273
00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:53.916
I saw you in the photo. Uncle.
but now you have changed a lot.

274
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.125
But you are the same as you were
when you were a kid?

275
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
What's wrong?

276
00:26:58.083 --> 00:26:59.666
That's how you welcome our Vicky back?

277
00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.208
What else should I do?
Why should I welcome him anyway?

278
00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:05.708
-Listen to me. Bhuvi…
-Wait. brother. Let me talk to her.

279
00:27:10.083 --> 00:27:11.041
How are you. sister-in-law?

280
00:27:12.958 --> 00:27:15.625
It's been 14 years since I heard this.

281
00:27:16.833 --> 00:27:20.958
There's never been a day when these eyes
don't expect you all these years.

282
00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:26.041
I would cook your favorite dishes
with these hands every day.

283
00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:27.875
but you never came to eat them. right?

284
00:27:29.166 --> 00:27:30.583
If it had been your mother.

285
00:27:31.708 --> 00:27:33.833
would you have left her like this?

286
00:27:36.041 --> 00:27:38.666
Did you even call me once
in all these years?

287
00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.916
Have you forgotten that you have
a family of your own?

288
00:27:42.125 --> 00:27:44.500
-Or did you think we're all dead?
-Sister…

289
00:27:44.666 --> 00:27:45.916
What is this. Bhuvanamma?

290
00:27:46.458 --> 00:27:48.791
Till yesterday you have prayed to
every God on earth for Vicky's return.

291
00:27:48.916 --> 00:27:50.125
and now that he is back
you are scolding him.

292
00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:51.416
It's okay. Let her speak. uncle.

293
00:27:52.916 --> 00:27:55.291
Had it been my mom.
she would have thrashed me left and right.

294
00:27:56.333 --> 00:27:58.875
Sister-in-law is letting me go
with just scoldings.

295
00:28:02.958 --> 00:28:04.500
Why did you leave?

296
00:28:06.916 --> 00:28:08.833
I didn't know at that young age.

297
00:28:10.791 --> 00:28:12.000
I thought if you got what you wanted.

298
00:28:12.666 --> 00:28:14.083
you'll find everything.

299
00:28:14.375 --> 00:28:15.250
But…

300
00:28:15.875 --> 00:28:18.291
unbeknownst to me. the years passed.

301
00:28:20.583 --> 00:28:22.500
I will never hurt you again.

302
00:28:25.916 --> 00:28:26.958
-Uncle.
-Yes?

303
00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:29.250
Take Vicky upstairs and show him his room.

304
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:31.583
Little one.

305
00:28:32.208 --> 00:28:34.291
This is the room that your brother
has built for you.

306
00:28:34.541 --> 00:28:37.416
It was a daily routine. Every day
he would come here and think of you.

307
00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:42.708
Little one.

308
00:28:43.625 --> 00:28:47.625
In all these years I've never seen
your brother so happy before.

309
00:28:48.708 --> 00:28:50.541
He should be like this forever.

310
00:28:51.708 --> 00:28:52.541
That's it.

311
00:29:01.583 --> 00:29:03.458
I got to know what my brother's love is.

312
00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:06.666
but if my brother finds out
who I am then…

313
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.083
Fantastic!

314
00:29:14.875 --> 00:29:15.875
Sanskrit!

315
00:29:16.916 --> 00:29:17.750
Wow!

316
00:29:18.666 --> 00:29:19.500
Eye!

317
00:29:19.916 --> 00:29:20.791
Creation!

318
00:29:32.958 --> 00:29:33.791
Guruji.

319
00:29:42.375 --> 00:29:44.083
Did you start early in the morning?

320
00:29:44.166 --> 00:29:45.416
-Bye. sir.
-I only drink coconut water.

321
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.875
Why did you put on makeup
early in the morning?

322
00:29:48.416 --> 00:29:50.583
Mr. Savitri. are my
children singing well?

323
00:29:50.666 --> 00:29:52.666
Singing? They are rocking.

324
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.833
Man! What is that pronunciation?

325
00:29:54.958 --> 00:29:56.333
They are not instant fast foods.

326
00:29:56.541 --> 00:29:59.750
I shall make her Ms. Subbulakshmi
and I'll make him MJ Micheal Jackson.

327
00:29:59.833 --> 00:30:02.000
We can do that later.
Do you want me to ask them for fees first?

328
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:04.583
Shut up! They gave us a place
in their house to run classes.

329
00:30:04.666 --> 00:30:06.666
Why do you need the fees?
It's free for them.

330
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:07.583
Thanks.

331
00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:11.166
Hey!

332
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.916
Did anyone die? Who is crying?

333
00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:14.750
My music sounds like crying?!

334
00:30:14.916 --> 00:30:16.958
-What are you talking about?
-Dear son!

335
00:30:17.041 --> 00:30:19.041
He is the music teacher for our children.

336
00:30:19.375 --> 00:30:20.666
His name is Savitri.

337
00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:23.541
-Savitri? What sort of name is that?
-Why?

338
00:30:23.875 --> 00:30:25.166
When Venkatesh can name
his character “Lakshmi”.

339
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.458
and Allu Arjun can name
his character “Pushpa”.

340
00:30:26.541 --> 00:30:28.958
-This is not just a name. This is fire.
-Who is he?

341
00:30:29.041 --> 00:30:32.333
My guru tried many names
for the screen presentation.

342
00:30:32.416 --> 00:30:34.083
The masculine names
didn't bring him any luck.

343
00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:36.541
that's why he chose a feminine name.
Savitri!

344
00:30:36.875 --> 00:30:39.083
It was unlucky or didn't suit him?!

345
00:30:39.333 --> 00:30:41.000
It was my guru's personal matter.

346
00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:43.666
It doesn't matter. Who are you?

347
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.666
He is Rajaram's younger brother Vicky.

348
00:30:46.833 --> 00:30:47.916
He came from Kolkata.

349
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.958
-You keep talking. I'll send you juice.
-Okay.

350
00:30:50.041 --> 00:30:52.125
Uncle. Don't send two glasses.
One and a half is enough.

351
00:30:52.208 --> 00:30:53.125
Because he is a half.

352
00:30:53.958 --> 00:30:57.083
-Do you have any interest in music?
-No.

353
00:30:57.166 --> 00:31:01.208
Savitri. even though he is not interested.
you seem to be very interested in him.

354
00:31:01.625 --> 00:31:03.125
Do you like him?

355
00:31:03.208 --> 00:31:04.458
Stop it.

356
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:09.833
Watching some people makes my heart
jump out and dance in jubilance!

357
00:31:09.916 --> 00:31:14.791
If you fall into my guru's eye.
you are just done!

358
00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:16.500
By the way. do you play the flute?

359
00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:19.458
I play the tabla. Do you want me to play?
I'll rip it into pieces.

360
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.250
Oh God! So many varieties?

361
00:31:22.458 --> 00:31:23.291
This is not fair. sister!

362
00:31:23.458 --> 00:31:24.916
Have you ever done
so much for this brother?

363
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.333
-Go away.
-No. you haven't.

364
00:31:26.416 --> 00:31:27.250
Vicky…

365
00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:29.333
what are you doing in Kolkata?

366
00:31:29.625 --> 00:31:33.166
Well. as soon as I went to Kolkata.
I joined a businessman.

367
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.208
-Business?
-Yes.

368
00:31:34.291 --> 00:31:35.125
What business?

369
00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:37.041
-Import and export company.
-Meaning?

370
00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:38.875
-Here.
-Picking up and dropping.

371
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:40.958
-Human beings?
-Materials!

372
00:31:41.083 --> 00:31:42.708
I didn't understand.

373
00:31:43.041 --> 00:31:44.125
Nothing. Uncle.

374
00:31:44.416 --> 00:31:46.958
A company from outside exports
something and sends it here.

375
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.583
We receive it and take care of it.

376
00:31:54.333 --> 00:31:57.583
Then we have to pack the return package
and send it back carefully. that's all.

377
00:31:58.958 --> 00:32:00.833
You have not got yourself
in any trouble. right?

378
00:32:00.916 --> 00:32:02.416
Why would I fight someone. brother?

379
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.791
Even if someone comes to quarrel with me.

380
00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:05.583
I say. Sairam. think of Lord Ram
and move aside.

381
00:32:05.666 --> 00:32:08.375
By the way. how much do you earn?

382
00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:10.541
-About 75.000 rupees.
-Is that all?

383
00:32:11.375 --> 00:32:13.416
It's not important how much
you're earning.

384
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.125
It is important whether he is living
with morals and principles or not.

385
00:32:19.625 --> 00:32:21.708
Enough with your interview. eat the meal.

386
00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:23.791
-or it'll get cold.
-Okay.

387
00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:24.833
Enough!

388
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.416
-Hello?
-Is the fish good?

389
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.583
While eating these. I remembered
all my childhood memories. sister.

390
00:32:35.458 --> 00:32:37.708
All these are special dishes cooked
by your sister-in-law.

391
00:32:38.208 --> 00:32:39.416
You won't find it anywhere outside.

392
00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:42.000
Sister-in-law's culinary skills
should not be confined to this house.

393
00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:43.583
Let's make a video
and put it on YouTube.

394
00:32:43.666 --> 00:32:45.333
What? You will put it on YouTube?

395
00:32:45.458 --> 00:32:46.916
Put it on Zomato or Swiggy.

396
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.333
What will you get if you put it
on YouTube?

397
00:32:48.583 --> 00:32:50.958
You. idiot.
Do you know the power of YouTube?

398
00:32:51.166 --> 00:32:52.375
Money. name. fame.

399
00:32:52.458 --> 00:32:54.416
Those who know how to cook. those
who don't know. those who are learned.

400
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.333
and those who are not.

401
00:32:55.416 --> 00:32:56.708
all the Telugu-speaking people
around the world would watch her video.

402
00:32:56.791 --> 00:32:58.166
and sister-in-law will automatically
become a star.

403
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.250
Dear. I don't want to be a star.

404
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.416
I'm happy to stand behind my husband!

405
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.166
Will you always stand behind your husband?

406
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.500
For once.
try standing next to your husband.

407
00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:06.875
That's when people outside this house
will know you.

408
00:33:06.958 --> 00:33:08.458
-Dear…
-I'm willing to bet on her cooking.

409
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:10.583
Anything you wish to do.
you have my support.

410
00:33:10.666 --> 00:33:13.458
This encouragement is enough. brother.
Tomorrow I'll get my men and make a video.

411
00:33:13.541 --> 00:33:14.958
-Vicky…
-Sister-in-law. don't say anything else.

412
00:33:15.041 --> 00:33:16.416
It's done. let's eat.

413
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.458
-Exactly.
-I'm hungry.

414
00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:21.666
-What is it?
-Yes. boss.

415
00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:22.833
I don't know how they found out.

416
00:33:22.958 --> 00:33:25.333
but they knew that you're not here.
and they attacked us at Kalighat.

417
00:33:25.416 --> 00:33:27.833
Our men counter-attacked them
and escaped with minor injuries.

418
00:33:27.916 --> 00:33:30.000
Boss. they are asking about you.

419
00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:31.833
We are worried that they will come
to Hyderabad looking for you.

420
00:33:31.916 --> 00:33:33.625
If that happens…

421
00:33:33.708 --> 00:33:34.958
I would lose my family forever.

422
00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:35.875
I know. boss.

423
00:33:35.958 --> 00:33:37.791
-Please be careful.
-Yes. boss.

424
00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:40.916
Look. no one should know
that I am in Hyderabad.

425
00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.875
I have asked Bhairavi to come here.
you should come with her.

426
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.500
Ask Gupta to manage everything until then.

427
00:33:47.708 --> 00:33:48.541
-Okay. boss.
-Okay. boss.

428
00:33:48.958 --> 00:33:49.833
Vicky.

429
00:33:52.375 --> 00:33:54.041
You haven't slept yet. brother?

430
00:33:54.875 --> 00:33:55.750
No.

431
00:33:57.208 --> 00:33:59.041
I wanted to talk to you.

432
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.791
Seeing you again after all these years…

433
00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:05.583
it feels like a weight
has been lifted off my chest.

434
00:34:05.875 --> 00:34:08.500
If you are angry with
what I said that day.

435
00:34:08.916 --> 00:34:09.750
please forgive me.

436
00:34:09.833 --> 00:34:11.500
No! Please don't ask
for forgiveness. brother.

437
00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:12.791
I was scared.

438
00:34:13.583 --> 00:34:16.791
I was afraid of what you were going to do
or what would happen to you.

439
00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:20.791
I can't tell you
how happy I am to find out

440
00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:23.000
that you have put aside all the rage…

441
00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:25.250
and have come home
a completely changed person.

442
00:34:26.791 --> 00:34:28.000
Congratulations. brother.

443
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.250
The Hotel Sukhibhava that you've set up
has become a chain of hotels today.

444
00:34:31.708 --> 00:34:33.375
The central government
has also given you an award.

445
00:34:33.583 --> 00:34:35.500
anyone wanting to enter the food
business at the international level

446
00:34:35.583 --> 00:34:36.750
has to obtain the license from you.

447
00:34:36.875 --> 00:34:38.291
Janani told me a lot about you. brother.

448
00:34:40.625 --> 00:34:41.458
What else did she say?

449
00:34:42.708 --> 00:34:43.583
That was it.

450
00:34:43.666 --> 00:34:44.791
Is there anything that I need to know?

451
00:34:44.875 --> 00:34:46.916
No. there's nothing else. That's it.

452
00:34:47.583 --> 00:34:48.625
You must be tired.

453
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.000
Good night. go to sleep.

454
00:34:50.625 --> 00:34:51.458
Okay. brother.

455
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.875
You didn't sign my food products license.
right?

456
00:35:35.083 --> 00:35:36.500
-I won't.
-Okay. sir.

457
00:35:36.708 --> 00:35:39.000
-Come.
-The products have high chemicals in them.

458
00:35:40.333 --> 00:35:41.416
I am forwarding a recommendation

459
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:44.291
that you can neither export your products
nor manufacture them in India.

460
00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:47.041
Selling food products is a business.

461
00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:49.041
Not a social service.

462
00:35:49.375 --> 00:35:51.166
I am not asking you to do social service.

463
00:35:51.833 --> 00:35:52.916
I am saying

464
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
that a person who does any business
should have a social responsibility.

465
00:35:56.083 --> 00:35:57.291
Sukhibhava!

466
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.958
You are running your Hotel Sukhibhava.
right?

467
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.416
We wouldn't stop you.

468
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:07.166
If you would restrict yourself
to organic foods.

469
00:36:07.416 --> 00:36:11.625
then you will get government jobs
and awards.

470
00:36:12.416 --> 00:36:14.916
But you will make no money in business.

471
00:36:16.791 --> 00:36:22.625
The health of 147 crore people
in this country depends on my signature

472
00:36:24.125 --> 00:36:26.208
They see the seal of this organization

473
00:36:26.291 --> 00:36:29.375
and eat it with the belief this
won't harm them if they eat it.

474
00:36:30.583 --> 00:36:33.375
I can't pledge that trust
for your business.

475
00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:35.666
You're rubbing me on the wrong side.
Rajaram.

476
00:36:35.958 --> 00:36:39.708
If I start the game. the consequences
will be very harsh.

477
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:41.166
I'm ready.

478
00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:52.250
I don't want any adulteration
on my premises.

479
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.333
Get out!

480
00:37:01.083 --> 00:37:03.458
I'll see your end.

481
00:37:06.583 --> 00:37:07.458
Dear!

482
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.375
What happened?

483
00:37:17.833 --> 00:37:18.833
Bhuvaneswari.

484
00:37:20.125 --> 00:37:21.708
Under no circumstances should Vicky
be made aware of the quarrels…

485
00:37:21.791 --> 00:37:22.625
I am having with GK.

486
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.875
I can't bear it if Vicky is away
from me again.

487
00:37:27.541 --> 00:37:28.625
Tell uncle too.

488
00:37:35.916 --> 00:37:36.750
Fantastic!

489
00:37:36.833 --> 00:37:38.333
-Sir. money.
-Yes. I'll pay.

490
00:37:38.416 --> 00:37:40.333
-If you want money…
-Who are they?

491
00:37:40.416 --> 00:37:42.833
-The red painting is very good.
-It's not a red painting. It's tiles.

492
00:37:42.916 --> 00:37:44.083
-That's tiles?
-Stupid!

493
00:37:44.291 --> 00:37:46.041
-Steady--
-Hey! Who are you?

494
00:37:46.125 --> 00:37:46.958
How can you barge directly into the house?

495
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:48.625
Hello. Mr. Purushottam.
How are you?

496
00:37:48.708 --> 00:37:49.625
How do you know my name?

497
00:37:49.708 --> 00:37:51.250
Sir. we called you Purushottam because
you are the best among all men.

498
00:37:51.333 --> 00:37:52.666
-Aren't you…
-The best man?

499
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.291
-Or are you just an ordinary man?
-Or are you not a man at all?

500
00:37:54.375 --> 00:37:55.750
-Okay.
-Catch me!

501
00:37:55.958 --> 00:37:59.458
Dad. You slept with us
in the kid's room at night.

502
00:37:59.541 --> 00:38:01.500
so how did you go to the
bedroom in the morning?

503
00:38:01.791 --> 00:38:04.416
Well. your mother had a headache
so I went to apply some medicine.

504
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.041
-Go and play. Go.
-Oh! Okay.

505
00:38:06.125 --> 00:38:08.625
-Wow! You are a man!
-Wow! You are a man!

506
00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:16.708
Who is she?

507
00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:18.416
Our girl.

508
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.041
-Your girl?
-Yes.

509
00:38:20.416 --> 00:38:21.916
Looking at your behavior.
I feel something is wrong.

510
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.291
-What is it Purushottam?
-What's wrong?

511
00:38:23.458 --> 00:38:24.625
What are you doing here?

512
00:38:24.708 --> 00:38:26.250
-Salutations. Mr. Suridu.
-Who are they?

513
00:38:26.458 --> 00:38:29.375
What the heck! How do you know my name?

514
00:38:29.458 --> 00:38:31.000
I know everything about you.

515
00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:32.458
How are your leg aches?
Has the pain reduced?

516
00:38:32.541 --> 00:38:33.958
-My leg pain went away long back.
-Really?

517
00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:36.625
-How do you know he has knee cramps?
-I asked if there was something wrong.

518
00:38:36.708 --> 00:38:37.666
But. who are they?

519
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:38.583
Uncle.

520
00:38:39.291 --> 00:38:40.125
Yes.

521
00:38:43.041 --> 00:38:46.500
Uncle. I called them from Kolkata to shoot
my sister-in-law's cooking video.

522
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.041
Really?

523
00:38:48.708 --> 00:38:49.833
Why didn't you tell me that?

524
00:38:49.916 --> 00:38:51.666
-Go in. get in.
-Okay.

525
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.041
-Get the lunch box ready. go.
-We serve a lot of varieties.

526
00:38:53.125 --> 00:38:54.000
Brother.

527
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:55.666
Her name is Bhairavi.

528
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.083
-a famous celebrity on YouTube.
-Namaste.

529
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.166
I invited them here to shoot
sister-in-law's cooking video.

530
00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:00.083
Namaste.

531
00:39:00.708 --> 00:39:02.166
He is the director
and he is the cameraman.

532
00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:03.166
-Cameraman.
-Cameraman. sir.

533
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.541
-Director.
-Cameraman.

534
00:39:04.625 --> 00:39:05.791
Director…

535
00:39:06.083 --> 00:39:07.875
He is the director.
I am the cameraman. sir.

536
00:39:07.958 --> 00:39:08.916
Oh!

537
00:39:09.125 --> 00:39:10.333
These are my friends. Ajju. Vijju.

538
00:39:10.416 --> 00:39:11.250
Boss.

539
00:39:11.708 --> 00:39:12.583
What is this?

540
00:39:13.041 --> 00:39:14.833
You're saying they are your friends.
but they're calling you boss.

541
00:39:14.916 --> 00:39:16.625
Actually. not boss. sir. Box.

542
00:39:16.708 --> 00:39:18.708
-Lens box.
-He said Lens box.

543
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:21.541
Okay. The cooking video should be a hit.

544
00:39:22.041 --> 00:39:25.333
The entire world should know
about my wife's amazing dishes.

545
00:39:25.416 --> 00:39:26.958
Ask for whatever you want
without any hesitation.

546
00:39:27.041 --> 00:39:28.125
I want your brother.

547
00:39:33.875 --> 00:39:34.708
I mean.

548
00:39:34.791 --> 00:39:38.125
it would be better if there was someone
I knew beside me while shooting the video.

549
00:39:38.208 --> 00:39:39.041
Yes.

550
00:39:39.125 --> 00:39:41.041
Girl. Can I be your assistant?

551
00:39:42.375 --> 00:39:43.625
Let me know where should I stay.

552
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.375
What? What's that?

553
00:39:45.708 --> 00:39:47.375
She asks where she can stay in the house.

554
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.833
Enough!

555
00:39:51.458 --> 00:39:53.958
-Janani. show the girl her room.
-Okay. Mom.

556
00:39:54.208 --> 00:39:55.125
Come with me.

557
00:39:57.791 --> 00:39:59.291
-Thank you. sir.
-Go to the room and freshen up.

558
00:39:59.375 --> 00:40:00.250
-Let's go…
-Careful with the box.

559
00:40:00.333 --> 00:40:02.166
This house is great for shooting.

560
00:40:02.541 --> 00:40:03.375
Your room is upstairs.

561
00:40:03.458 --> 00:40:05.541
-The view from here is very good.
-Really?

562
00:40:05.625 --> 00:40:06.500
I think our room is upstairs.

563
00:40:06.583 --> 00:40:09.166
-It's urgent.
-It's urgent for me as well.

564
00:40:15.375 --> 00:40:17.416
-Why are you in such a hurry?
-I said it's urgent.

565
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.416
-It's urgent for me as well.
-It's urgent for me as well.

566
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.625
You fool!

567
00:40:20.708 --> 00:40:21.916
Close it. Come on!

568
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:26.708
-Sorry…
-Hey. I've seen it. I saw it!

569
00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:28.583
-Thief. what are you hiding?
-What? What did you see?

570
00:40:28.666 --> 00:40:30.250
-Take it out once.
-What did you see?

571
00:40:30.333 --> 00:40:32.125
-Take it out.
-Listen to me. there's nothing in it.

572
00:40:32.208 --> 00:40:33.625
-What's the problem to show?
-Don't you understand what I'm saying?

573
00:40:33.708 --> 00:40:34.625
Show it once.

574
00:40:34.708 --> 00:40:37.041
There's nothing to show.
It's just a violin.

575
00:40:37.125 --> 00:40:38.041
Violin?

576
00:40:38.125 --> 00:40:39.000
Violin.

577
00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:39.958
Now you must show it.

578
00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:42.833
Lilly. that's a French violin.

579
00:40:43.125 --> 00:40:45.833
Cecilio Special Edition. It's very costly.

580
00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:47.916
I can't take it out wherever I go.

581
00:40:48.125 --> 00:40:49.041
-Guruji.
-Yes!

582
00:40:49.125 --> 00:40:51.125
-Cecilio version it is.
-Yes.

583
00:40:51.208 --> 00:40:52.375
French violin.

584
00:40:53.375 --> 00:40:57.375
Since childhood.
my guru has wanted to play it.

585
00:40:57.458 --> 00:40:59.875
-If you can give it once…
-Since your childhood or his?

586
00:40:59.958 --> 00:41:01.291
Since my guru's childhood.

587
00:41:02.916 --> 00:41:04.500
Do you play the violin?

588
00:41:04.708 --> 00:41:05.708
I do. But very mildly.

589
00:41:05.791 --> 00:41:06.791
Guruji…

590
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.583
Shut up! I'm going to hit you now.

591
00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:10.000
Why don't you play the violin for once?

592
00:41:10.083 --> 00:41:12.291
He will play after getting fresh.

593
00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:13.833
Vicky.

594
00:41:13.916 --> 00:41:15.541
Why don't you show your violin once?

595
00:41:15.625 --> 00:41:16.625
Are there any bombs in it?

596
00:41:16.708 --> 00:41:17.541
It has a gun.

597
00:41:20.625 --> 00:41:21.500
Gun?

598
00:41:22.708 --> 00:41:25.500
Oh. my God!
Your sense of humor is so vibrating.

599
00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:28.541
You go and finish your shower.
I will wait here till you come.

600
00:41:28.625 --> 00:41:30.000
Take care of him.

601
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.750
Go to your room.

602
00:41:31.833 --> 00:41:33.541
You always intervene at the right time.

603
00:41:33.625 --> 00:41:35.500
-I'll show you what I am at midnight.
-I'll see.

604
00:41:35.583 --> 00:41:37.416
-Go.
-Hey. come here once.

605
00:41:37.583 --> 00:41:39.250
-Be a little careful with him.
-Why?

606
00:41:39.333 --> 00:41:40.583
-He is an emasculate person.
-What is that?

607
00:41:40.916 --> 00:41:42.208
-Do you know Bangkok?
-Yes.

608
00:41:44.375 --> 00:41:45.833
-That means. there's nothing there.
-Nothing?

609
00:41:45.916 --> 00:41:46.916
Oh God!

610
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.416
-Boss. please--
-Who brought the gun?

611
00:41:50.791 --> 00:41:51.750
-Him. boss.
-Him. boss.

612
00:41:52.333 --> 00:41:53.208
-Me. boss.
-Me. boss.

613
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.583
Tell me correctly. who brought it?

614
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
We both brought it. boss.

615
00:41:57.083 --> 00:41:57.958
Why did you bring it?

616
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.500
We thought if Mukherjee found out that you
were in Hyderabad he might attack you.

617
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:02.833
-We brought it for your safety. boss.
-We brought it for your safety. boss.

618
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.958
All right. make sure my brother
never sees it.

619
00:42:08.041 --> 00:42:10.708
If he sees it. my marriage and your life.
both will be lost.

620
00:42:10.791 --> 00:42:11.916
-Okay. boss.
-One more thing…

621
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.083
I told my elder brother that I work
as a manager in import and export.

622
00:42:14.166 --> 00:42:15.750
-You need to maintain that lie.
-Yes. boss.

623
00:42:18.708 --> 00:42:19.625
How's it?

624
00:42:19.916 --> 00:42:20.750
-Super!
-Super!

625
00:42:20.833 --> 00:42:23.208
It's very nice.
I can't tell you how good it is.

626
00:42:23.375 --> 00:42:24.875
Bhairavi chose this sari.

627
00:42:25.083 --> 00:42:27.166
See. how intelligent Bhairavi is?

628
00:42:27.958 --> 00:42:30.166
-Very intelligent.
-Very talented.

629
00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:33.166
-Whoever marries her will be very lucky.
-Will be very lucky.

630
00:42:33.416 --> 00:42:34.250
Hey!

631
00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:36.000
Are you here to praise her
or to shoot the video?

632
00:42:36.083 --> 00:42:37.208
Shut up and do your job.

633
00:42:37.291 --> 00:42:38.375
You…

634
00:42:38.708 --> 00:42:40.583
Sir. will you please keep quiet?

635
00:42:41.791 --> 00:42:43.333
She asked you to shut up in English.

636
00:42:44.708 --> 00:42:46.708
Why does she talk to me in English?

637
00:42:46.791 --> 00:42:49.208
Sister. you have to watch the camera
frequently while cooking.

638
00:42:49.541 --> 00:42:50.708
And what if this burns meanwhile?

639
00:42:50.791 --> 00:42:52.166
The shooting part is new to Mom.

640
00:42:52.625 --> 00:42:53.500
But not the cooking part. right?

641
00:42:54.416 --> 00:42:56.166
She has a good sense of humor.

642
00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:57.500
She makes everyone laugh.

643
00:42:58.625 --> 00:43:02.208
-Very punctual.
-Very amiable too.

644
00:43:02.291 --> 00:43:03.916
Whoever marries her…

645
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.333
-will be very lucky.
-will be very lucky.

646
00:43:06.458 --> 00:43:07.333
Really?

647
00:43:07.416 --> 00:43:08.708
-Action!
-Camera.

648
00:43:09.208 --> 00:43:12.458
Now. my sister is going to tell you
about a special curry.

649
00:43:13.583 --> 00:43:16.166
What we are going to
do today is okra fish broth.

650
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:20.041
First add curry leaves.
turmeric. and chili.

651
00:43:20.125 --> 00:43:22.125
Spices should be crushed in this old way.

652
00:43:22.208 --> 00:43:23.541
Finally. add the fish.

653
00:43:24.583 --> 00:43:26.375
Bhuvanamma. the soup seems to be burned.

654
00:43:28.041 --> 00:43:29.833
It's okay. no problem.

655
00:43:30.208 --> 00:43:31.708
Yes. it's gone.

656
00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.541
Shall we do it again?

657
00:43:34.125 --> 00:43:35.041
No problem sister.

658
00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:38.208
We know that it's burnt at the bottom.
but those who are seeing it don't know.

659
00:43:38.833 --> 00:43:41.458
I'll taste a little and tell them
that it's good.

660
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:42.625
Superb covering.

661
00:43:42.916 --> 00:43:44.500
-Very talented…
-Very talented!

662
00:43:44.833 --> 00:43:47.291
Whoever marries her will be very lucky.

663
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:48.916
This is what you are going to say. right?

664
00:43:51.166 --> 00:43:53.125
What's wrong with it?

665
00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:55.291
Bhairavi is really talented.

666
00:43:55.583 --> 00:43:56.833
She has done well.

667
00:44:07.708 --> 00:44:09.458
Vicky. What?

668
00:44:09.875 --> 00:44:10.833
Come out once.

669
00:44:11.416 --> 00:44:12.250
Now?!

670
00:44:15.791 --> 00:44:18.375
-Come on.
-What? Where?

671
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.416
Come on.

672
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:27.375
Come.

673
00:44:27.541 --> 00:44:30.125
Vicky. Why did you bring me here?
What if someone sees us?

674
00:44:30.208 --> 00:44:31.708
The bed is scolding me for sleeping alone.

675
00:44:32.083 --> 00:44:33.750
Then tell your brother and sister-in-law.

676
00:44:33.833 --> 00:44:35.875
Then we can both sleep on the same bed.

677
00:44:35.958 --> 00:44:38.333
I'll tell them very soon.
The morning plan was a super success.

678
00:44:38.416 --> 00:44:39.333
So let me tell you another plan.

679
00:44:39.416 --> 00:44:40.250
Give me a kiss.

680
00:44:47.833 --> 00:44:50.291
Hello. it's been a long time
since the thunder left.

681
00:44:51.375 --> 00:44:52.625
Did the thunder leave already?

682
00:44:53.375 --> 00:44:55.708
It thunders only for a short while.

683
00:44:55.791 --> 00:44:58.916
Baby. Soni. It's raining. come up quickly.

684
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.666
Bhuvanamma. coming.
We are coming.

685
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:02.208
-What is it. sister?
-Bhuvanamma called us. Come on.

686
00:45:02.291 --> 00:45:03.666
Tell Purushottam to also come.

687
00:45:06.125 --> 00:45:08.541
Would it be nice if the thunder came
one more time?

688
00:45:13.375 --> 00:45:14.208
Vicky.

689
00:45:18.875 --> 00:45:19.875
What is this?

690
00:45:21.708 --> 00:45:23.750
Sister. don't misunderstand me.

691
00:45:24.083 --> 00:45:25.166
It was Bhairavi who loved me.

692
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:26.208
I told her that I'd get
married only if you agreed to it.

693
00:45:26.291 --> 00:45:27.916
I told her clearly
otherwise I won't marry her.

694
00:45:28.083 --> 00:45:31.583
Yes. She loves you
and she only wants to marry you.

695
00:45:32.208 --> 00:45:35.333
You don't have any feelings
for her. right?

696
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:38.166
-Okay. Come. Bhairavi.
-Sister.

697
00:45:38.333 --> 00:45:41.000
-Please.
-I don't want your over-acting.

698
00:45:41.375 --> 00:45:43.666
Tell me what happened as it happened.

699
00:45:49.458 --> 00:45:53.041
We do not wish to give our daughter
to an orphan like you.

700
00:45:54.791 --> 00:45:56.791
Was this the inner meaning
of your praises?

701
00:45:57.041 --> 00:46:01.041
I understand that when
you praise her unnecessarily.

702
00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:02.833
-That girl is very--
-Shut up. I'll break your jaws.

703
00:46:03.416 --> 00:46:04.375
You see that?

704
00:46:04.541 --> 00:46:07.416
Did you find this out now?
We knew it long ago.

705
00:46:07.958 --> 00:46:10.583
It's very difficult to convince him
for this marriage.

706
00:46:10.958 --> 00:46:14.583
Vicky. let's not keep our hopes high.
But we'll try anyway.

707
00:46:21.583 --> 00:46:24.833
Then you didn't come for us. right?

708
00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:28.708
No. that's not it. I didn't know
what you were going to say.

709
00:46:36.375 --> 00:46:37.791
Why are you worried?

710
00:46:39.166 --> 00:46:42.000
You have been separated
from us for the last 14 years.

711
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:44.041
but Bhairavi has brought you to us.

712
00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:47.916
Who can bring more luck
to this house than her?

713
00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.916
Dear Bhairavi. let's call your parents
and talk to them.

714
00:46:54.833 --> 00:46:55.791
Yes!

715
00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:58.416
Thank you. sister-in-law.

716
00:47:15.125 --> 00:47:18.916
Holding iPhone in your hand
Wearing high-class perfume over you

717
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.541
Wearing a high-class sandal
When you walk like that

718
00:47:22.625 --> 00:47:26.041
Walking like a model on a ramp

719
00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:29.916
My heart beats very fast
Oh. my Bengali Baby

720
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.916
My heart beats very fast
Oh. my Diwali cracker

721
00:47:41.041 --> 00:47:44.666
Wearing a Rolex watch and RayBan glasses

722
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:48.416
Wearing a Raymond suit
When you come in your Range Rover

723
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.583
When you come revving that engine

724
00:47:51.958 --> 00:47:55.750
My heart beats very fast
Darling. it blooms up like it's spring

725
00:47:55.833 --> 00:47:59.958
My heart beats very fast
Darling. how to control this feeling?

726
00:48:08.708 --> 00:48:12.416
My heart wants to suck up
The ice candy-like body of yours

727
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:16.083
The thunder in your chubby cheeks
Is electrocuting me

728
00:48:16.166 --> 00:48:19.791
Oh. my sweetheart
I love your description of me

729
00:48:19.875 --> 00:48:23.833
This gorgeous girl is yours
Play any game you like with her

730
00:48:25.333 --> 00:48:28.833
The intensity of earthquakes
Isn't readable on a Richter scale

731
00:48:29.041 --> 00:48:35.750
I just want to get lost
In the depths of your navel

732
00:48:36.416 --> 00:48:39.541
My heart. oh my heart

733
00:48:40.166 --> 00:48:47.166
My heart beats very fast
Oh. my Bengali Baby

734
00:48:47.541 --> 00:48:51.125
My heart beats very fast
Darling. it blooms up like it's spring

735
00:48:51.208 --> 00:48:55.166
My heart beats very fast
Darling. how to control this feeling?

736
00:49:17.083 --> 00:49:20.666
One sight of yours
And I start dancing on the spot

737
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:24.333
My eyes are glued to your curves
Like a bond of glue

738
00:49:24.416 --> 00:49:28.083
This colorful bird has flown onto you

739
00:49:28.166 --> 00:49:32.125
You are free to break the boundaries
To enjoy these curves

740
00:49:33.666 --> 00:49:35.458
How pretty are you

741
00:49:35.541 --> 00:49:37.375
Your smile is a vitamin supplement

742
00:49:37.458 --> 00:49:42.291
I'll be the jasmine in your hair
Come. my darling

743
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:50.208
My heart beats very fast

744
00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:52.083
Oh. my Bengali Baby

745
00:49:52.166 --> 00:49:55.750
My heart beats very fast
Oh. my Bengali Baby

746
00:49:55.833 --> 00:49:59.375
My heart beats very fast
Darling. it blooms up like it's spring

747
00:49:59.541 --> 00:50:03.083
My heart beats very fast
Darling. how to control this feeling?

748
00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:06.750
My heart beats very fast
Oh. my Bengali Baby

749
00:50:06.833 --> 00:50:10.750
My heart beats very fast
Oh. my Bengali Baby

750
00:51:35.916 --> 00:51:37.000
He hit hard. right?

751
00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:39.875
What's the matter? Haven't you slept yet?

752
00:51:39.958 --> 00:51:41.333
We are watching an action film. brother.

753
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.625
-Hero is killing it.
-He is attacking from the shadows.

754
00:51:52.666 --> 00:51:54.250
It's already late. now go to bed.

755
00:51:54.333 --> 00:51:55.875
We'll go to bed as soon
as this fight is over. sir.

756
00:52:14.708 --> 00:52:15.541
Vicky.

757
00:52:16.541 --> 00:52:17.458
What are you doing here?

758
00:52:17.916 --> 00:52:19.333
I've come for water.

759
00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:26.708
-I've kept it in your room.
-I didn't see it.

760
00:53:35.291 --> 00:53:36.125
Vicky?

761
00:53:36.208 --> 00:53:37.541
AMRUTA NILAYAM

762
00:53:38.833 --> 00:53:40.208
Vicky. What happened?

763
00:53:40.583 --> 00:53:42.833
Who came? What's the matter. Vicky?

764
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.458
Nothing. Bhuvanamma.

765
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:47.625
We've been hearing that thefts
have increased these days.

766
00:53:47.708 --> 00:53:49.083
They might have targeted our house.

767
00:53:49.166 --> 00:53:51.916
If they fled as soon as we arrived. who
would it have been other than the thieves?

768
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.125
Why are the thieves who never came here
before coming now?

769
00:53:54.291 --> 00:53:56.041
Do thieves go to the same house every day?

770
00:53:56.208 --> 00:53:57.250
-They came to this house today.
-Right!

771
00:53:57.833 --> 00:54:00.208
Good riddance! Glad that Vicky saw them
and nobody was harmed.

772
00:54:00.291 --> 00:54:01.541
Vicky. are you alright?

773
00:54:01.625 --> 00:54:02.708
Nothing happened.

774
00:54:02.875 --> 00:54:05.375
Okay. come on.
Nothing happened to anyone.

775
00:54:05.458 --> 00:54:06.500
-Let's go.
-Go on.

776
00:54:06.583 --> 00:54:07.791
-Bloody. thieves…
-Come on. Vicky.

777
00:54:08.625 --> 00:54:09.500
Let's go.

778
00:54:26.041 --> 00:54:31.375
Boss. because you were alert
there was no problem for those at home.

779
00:54:31.458 --> 00:54:32.375
Yes. boss.

780
00:54:33.541 --> 00:54:34.916
Do you understand now?

781
00:54:35.958 --> 00:54:38.208
Why didn't I come to this house all
these years even when I wanted to?

782
00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:41.166
I don't want such accidents
to happen because of me.

783
00:54:41.958 --> 00:54:44.500
Who was that?
They are not Mukherjee's men.

784
00:54:44.583 --> 00:54:46.208
Start the inquiry tomorrow.

785
00:54:46.875 --> 00:54:48.291
Who came. where did they come from.

786
00:54:48.375 --> 00:54:51.333
how do they know that I am here?
I need every detail.

787
00:54:51.416 --> 00:54:52.375
-Okay. boss.
-Okay. boss.

788
00:54:52.458 --> 00:54:55.041
Dear. they are GK's men.

789
00:54:55.666 --> 00:54:57.750
I can't see Vicky being disturbed.

790
00:54:58.583 --> 00:55:00.958
He was happy until he came here.

791
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:04.541
It's not right to be here at this time.

792
00:55:06.166 --> 00:55:07.666
Let's go back to our village
for a few days.

793
00:55:09.625 --> 00:55:15.125
Hey. What reason do we tell Vicky?

794
00:55:20.375 --> 00:55:22.166
Let the bygones be bygones.

795
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:26.166
You kept postponing the Maha Rudra Yagna
until your brother's return.

796
00:55:26.333 --> 00:55:28.750
Now it's time to complete your vow.

797
00:55:28.833 --> 00:55:30.875
Perform the yagna immediately. Rajaram.

798
00:55:30.958 --> 00:55:33.291
-I will definitely do it. Guruji.
-So be it!

799
00:55:34.166 --> 00:55:36.333
-She is my brother's fiance Bhairavi.
-Namaste.

800
00:55:36.416 --> 00:55:37.250
God bless!

801
00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:38.291
Listen.

802
00:55:38.416 --> 00:55:39.958
it is your responsibility
to complete this.

803
00:55:40.041 --> 00:55:42.791
No matter what the obstacles may be.

804
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:05.791
Oh Lord. you will come to this earth

805
00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:11.416
Whenever there is a hindrance to dharma

806
00:56:12.208 --> 00:56:17.708
Take a new avatar. decimate the evil

807
00:56:17.833 --> 00:56:23.000
Come to save your devotees
Oh Lord Narasimha

808
00:56:29.125 --> 00:56:31.666
The heart rings up

809
00:56:31.958 --> 00:56:36.833
The legs twirl and whirl
Let the fire spread wide

810
00:56:36.916 --> 00:56:39.666
Let the sky go wild

811
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:43.000
As the earth prepares
To welcome Lord Shiva

812
00:56:43.083 --> 00:56:45.875
Let the devotional dance loose
With songs of worship

813
00:56:45.958 --> 00:56:51.125
Let the Lord Narasimha enter our bodies

814
00:56:51.208 --> 00:56:56.916
Play the drums
Sway your legs

815
00:56:59.791 --> 00:57:03.500
Make some sound
Let the celebrations go wild

816
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:11.208
Make some sound
Let the celebrations go wild

817
00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:14.750
The carnival should make noise
In all directions

818
00:57:17.666 --> 00:57:20.375
The heart rings up

819
00:57:20.458 --> 00:57:25.833
The legs twirl and whirl

820
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.833
Let the fire spread wide
You are the human form of a lion

821
00:57:54.916 --> 00:57:57.833
Such is your strength

822
00:57:57.916 --> 00:58:03.416
The village where you stay
Swells their heart in pride

823
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:09.208
It takes the evil omen off you
And kisses you with love

824
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.458
When you are here

825
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.625
There is no place for worry
In their hearts

826
00:58:19.708 --> 00:58:25.333
I am half human
And half animal

827
00:58:25.416 --> 00:58:30.958
Lord Narasimha has inspired this in me
If you are good

828
00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:33.958
I'll be good
If you provoke me

829
00:58:34.041 --> 00:58:40.458
I'll warn you
If the evil raises its head

830
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:45.500
I'll chop it off

831
00:58:45.833 --> 00:58:51.500
Play the drums
Sway your legs

832
00:58:54.416 --> 00:58:57.791
Let the celebrations go wild
Make some sound

833
00:58:59.166 --> 00:59:05.708
Let the celebrations go wild
Make some sound

834
00:59:05.791 --> 00:59:09.375
The carnival should make noise
In all directions

835
00:59:12.291 --> 00:59:15.000
The heart rings up

836
00:59:16.583 --> 00:59:20.666
The legs twirl and whirl
Let the fire spread wide

837
00:59:43.625 --> 00:59:45.291
Boss! He is there.

838
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:46.833
-Boss.
-Boss.

839
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.958
-Okay. I will see you later.
-Okay.

840
00:59:49.458 --> 00:59:53.458
Boss. that Bihari gang
didn't attack our house for you.

841
00:59:53.541 --> 00:59:54.875
-Then?
-For your elder brother.

842
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:01.291
My elder brother?

843
01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:03.375
A complaint is not a big deal.

844
01:00:03.458 --> 01:00:04.625
I can file many of them.

845
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:06.791
But I can't take any action.

846
01:00:08.958 --> 01:00:12.041
If you go against GK. forget about
the police and politicians.

847
01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:15.291
nobody from the entire system
would come forward to support you.

848
01:00:15.541 --> 01:00:16.708
Who is this GK?

849
01:00:44.791 --> 01:00:47.291
There is a man named Paparao
in this town. boss. GK is his son-in-law.

850
01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:52.541
Paparao?

851
01:00:55.916 --> 01:00:56.875
Rajaram.

852
01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.125
No matter what yagna you perform.
your fate is not going to change.

853
01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:09.583
Because your fate is not
in the hands of this Narasimha.

854
01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.750
but in the hands of my son-in-law GK.

855
01:01:13.541 --> 01:01:15.250
That's why these arrangements.

856
01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:18.333
These cameras around you have not
come to cover this yagna that you perform.

857
01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:24.125
We are waiting for that one word.
That one word!

858
01:01:24.416 --> 01:01:26.083
The gang sent to kill our people
has already reached. boss.

859
01:01:26.166 --> 01:01:27.791
No one knows when they will attack
and from where.

860
01:01:29.708 --> 01:01:31.500
If I don't utter that word?

861
01:01:32.041 --> 01:01:34.958
Then. you wouldn't know
where your death will come from.

862
01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:38.083
and I don't know how terrible it will be.

863
01:01:38.166 --> 01:01:42.083
The five elements gather around
where the yagna takes place.

864
01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:47.583
As long as they're around me.
none of you can do anything to me.

865
01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:52.333
Oh! Will the earth split to save you?
Is the sky going to fall?

866
01:01:52.416 --> 01:01:55.541
Will the water sink us?
Will the wind blow us away?

867
01:01:55.625 --> 01:01:58.708
When necessary. everything
together becomes a form of terror.

868
01:01:58.791 --> 01:02:02.750
Hey! I should not hear any other sounds
apart from the instruments.

869
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.333
Don't let go of anyone who looks doubtful.

870
01:02:08.208 --> 01:02:11.291
We have to kill those scoundrels before
they can lay their hands on my family.

871
01:02:11.375 --> 01:02:13.875
Its name is Narasimha Avatar!

872
01:02:16.125 --> 01:02:19.458
When the time comes.
he appears in some form or the other.

873
01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:12.958
Hail Lord Lakshmi Narasimha!

874
01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:14.875
Boss. brother is safe.

875
01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.416
But I don't know
where sister-in-law is. boss.

876
01:03:18.416 --> 01:03:21.833
Janani! It would be great
to vlog all of this.

877
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:35.000
Take it all down.

878
01:03:37.375 --> 01:03:38.541
Is this sour enough?

879
01:03:38.625 --> 01:03:41.666
Everything was added according to the
measurement. I'm sure it must be fine.

880
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:43.916
Sister-in-law. you quickly go
to the yagna. It's time for Purnahuti.

881
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:44.833
The work is not yet done.

882
01:03:44.916 --> 01:03:46.500
and then the ones who were supposed
to make the offerings have just arrived.

883
01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:47.583
I'll take care of it. sister-in-law.

884
01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:50.958
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
Go. Quickly. we don't have time.

885
01:05:11.916 --> 01:05:13.375
Tell me where are the rest!

886
01:05:13.708 --> 01:05:14.625
Rice Mill.

887
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:20.708
Let's finish the job so that nobody
recognizes us.

888
01:05:30.708 --> 01:05:32.875
Hey. attack!

889
01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:26.250
Attack!

890
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:08.833
Hey!

891
01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:44.791
You…

892
01:07:45.208 --> 01:07:46.500
Brother of Rajaram.

893
01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:49.625
Rama had two pillars of support.
Lakshmana and Hanuman.

894
01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:53.250
I am the amalgamation of both.

895
01:07:53.708 --> 01:07:54.625
Hey!

896
01:07:55.291 --> 01:07:57.791
"He's innocent. he'll get
scared if he's threatened."

897
01:07:57.875 --> 01:08:00.208
"He seems like a good man.
we can force him to surrender."

898
01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:04.333
"He is alone. so he will bow down to me."
Get rid of these assumptions.

899
01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:09.000
He has a younger brother
who loves his elder brother.

900
01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:11.875
If he takes an oath. he won't break it!
If opposed. he will fight.

901
01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:13.000
If he is threatened. he will rebel!

902
01:08:13.083 --> 01:08:15.625
And if someone tries to scare him.
he will kill them!

903
01:08:16.541 --> 01:08:19.083
You think harassing my brother will work?

904
01:08:19.916 --> 01:08:23.250
When I was a child. I burned your hotel
for a license and took it away.

905
01:08:23.791 --> 01:08:25.791
If anyone tries to harm my elder brother.

906
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.125
I will burn him
and his entire empire down.

907
01:08:30.166 --> 01:08:31.750
Tell this to your son-in-law GK.

908
01:08:38.958 --> 01:08:43.416
I'm like the danger zone board
on a highway.

909
01:08:44.666 --> 01:08:47.250
and if you don't slow down
even after the warning.

910
01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:50.250
death will come looking for you.

911
01:08:51.416 --> 01:08:54.083
That death's name is Vicky!

912
01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:55.458
Son-in-law.

913
01:10:55.541 --> 01:10:58.208
Why didn't you tell me that
he has a younger brother?

914
01:10:58.291 --> 01:10:59.625
Actually…

915
01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:02.666
He ruined the entire plan.

916
01:11:09.541 --> 01:11:11.083
He ran away at an early age.

917
01:11:11.583 --> 01:11:14.166
and I didn't expect him to come back
like this and intimidate us.

918
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:16.000
He was not like a younger brother.

919
01:11:16.625 --> 01:11:17.833
he was like a terminator.

920
01:11:17.916 --> 01:11:20.958
Find out what is his strength.
what is his weakness.

921
01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:23.541
what is his background.
what is his network.

922
01:11:23.875 --> 01:11:26.625
Find out why he loves his brother so much.

923
01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:30.083
I don't know what you're going to do
or where you're going to go.

924
01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.875
the next time you meet me
you should have all these details.

925
01:11:33.958 --> 01:11:34.791
Okay. sir.

926
01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:38.333
-Mr. Rajaram.
-As you wish.

927
01:11:39.166 --> 01:11:40.125
What happened?

928
01:11:41.375 --> 01:11:43.000
Sir. there is a possibility
of cancellation of bail…

929
01:11:43.375 --> 01:11:44.875
in the orphanage case.

930
01:11:45.416 --> 01:11:48.333
If that happens. you will have
to go to jail.

931
01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:53.333
Dear. meet the honorable judge.

932
01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:55.375
Let's go.

933
01:12:06.083 --> 01:12:06.958
Oh. Lord.

934
01:12:08.416 --> 01:12:10.333
I haven't asked anything so far.

935
01:12:11.416 --> 01:12:12.625
but now I am.

936
01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:14.916
See to it that my husband does not stand
guilty

937
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.250
for the mistake he did not commit.

938
01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:34.041
You can hide the tears.

939
01:12:34.791 --> 01:12:36.041
but you can't hide the pain
in those eyes.

940
01:12:37.416 --> 01:12:38.375
Nothing. Vicky.

941
01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:39.875
Don't make me a stranger
yet again. sister.

942
01:12:40.416 --> 01:12:41.583
I'm not asking as your husband's brother.

943
01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:43.250
But as a son to his mother.

944
01:12:43.791 --> 01:12:45.250
Why is GK after my brother?

945
01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:49.458
Swear on me.

946
01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:52.250
What happened?

947
01:12:56.791 --> 01:13:02.875
Your elder brother was honored
with an award by the Indian Food Farm

948
01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:06.500
in recognition of his hard work over
the last 20 years to make people

949
01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:09.541
understand the importance
of organic farming and organic food.

950
01:13:09.625 --> 01:13:12.833
Sarvebhavantu-Niramayah.
Hello. everyone.

951
01:13:12.916 --> 01:13:18.291
There is nothing new I have done about
organic farming. about traditional food.

952
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:20.500
Our sages have written
about it a long time ago.

953
01:13:20.958 --> 01:13:22.333
That's our state's wealth.

954
01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:26.333
These diseases start in our green fields.

955
01:13:26.458 --> 01:13:30.875
The chemicals we use in modern agriculture
are getting into us.

956
01:13:31.166 --> 01:13:34.000
That's why along with blood.

957
01:13:34.541 --> 01:13:36.291
diseases have also
become a part of our body.

958
01:13:38.375 --> 01:13:42.416
Obesity and hormonal imbalances in this
generation of children are caused by this.

959
01:13:43.416 --> 01:13:45.708
Our daughters are becoming mature
at the age of ten.

960
01:13:47.416 --> 01:13:50.208
There are so many complications
during childbirth.

961
01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:56.833
If a mother's health is disturbed.
then all the next generations are ruined.

962
01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:03.500
Good food and good relationships
are the only things that can save a man.

963
01:14:04.041 --> 01:14:06.000
I wish for everybody's well-being.

964
01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:11.083
We are all fortunate that the Indian
Food Forum has honored Mr. Rajaram.

965
01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:13.208
who has been serving with the aim
that everyone should eat a healthy meal.

966
01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:15.541
with the “The Best Healthy Food Award".

967
01:14:17.208 --> 01:14:18.666
At that time. a man named GK…

968
01:14:18.958 --> 01:14:22.791
Forget about exports. I recommend it
to be not manufactured in India as well.

969
01:14:23.875 --> 01:14:29.041
Some of the GK food products were banned
due to a report given by your brother.

970
01:14:29.125 --> 01:14:33.125
But GK changed the brand name and started
selling the same products again.

971
01:14:33.208 --> 01:14:35.833
One day at an organic food exhibition.

972
01:14:35.916 --> 01:14:37.458
Paparao along with GK set up a stall

973
01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:39.750
of fake organic products
without permission.

974
01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:42.375
These are not organic.
they are chemical products.

975
01:14:42.458 --> 01:14:43.833
Who let the stall be put up here?

976
01:14:43.916 --> 01:14:44.750
-I don't know.
-I don't know. sir.

977
01:14:44.833 --> 01:14:45.750
Where is your entry card?

978
01:14:45.833 --> 01:14:46.833
Rajaram.

979
01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:51.083
I was gone for a moment
and you have created a ruckus.

980
01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.500
Hey. manager. didn't you tell him
that it isn't some stranger

981
01:14:54.083 --> 01:14:56.750
who has set this up. but it's me. Paparao?

982
01:14:56.833 --> 01:14:58.958
Your adulteration has not changed.
and neither have you changed.

983
01:14:59.166 --> 01:15:04.500
GK brands are international.

984
01:15:05.583 --> 01:15:09.666
Your brother has exposed the adulteration
in GK products in front of the media.

985
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:13.166
The permitted chemicals are being mixed
in large doses.

986
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:16.375
Many people have lost their lives
due to these GK Foods.

987
01:15:16.458 --> 01:15:20.083
GK Foods are dangerous.
Say no to GK Foods.

988
01:15:20.166 --> 01:15:22.750
Eat food. not chemicals.

989
01:15:23.333 --> 01:15:25.291
GK Foods are bad.

990
01:15:25.375 --> 01:15:27.083
GK company's shares fell drastically

991
01:15:27.166 --> 01:15:28.458
due to the statement given
by your brother.

992
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:31.208
International collaborations with
the GK group ceased immediately.

993
01:15:31.416 --> 01:15:35.958
Your brother's words that I have
the evidence started to scare GK.

994
01:15:36.125 --> 01:15:38.625
So he sent Paparao to the hotel

995
01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:40.958
-and threatened your elder brother.
-Hey!

996
01:15:41.125 --> 01:15:42.916
Hey. Paparao!

997
01:15:43.791 --> 01:15:46.916
Don't you know that it is bad manners to
force people to leave their food halfway?

998
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.750
Look. it will be better for you

999
01:15:48.833 --> 01:15:51.291
if you confess to the media
that the statement

1000
01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:55.625
you gave about GK Foods was because of
the wrong information that you received.

1001
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.250
Just say this one line to the media.
"GK Foods is good".

1002
01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:02.791
Otherwise. you will lose a lot.

1003
01:16:03.041 --> 01:16:04.541
No matter what I lose.

1004
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.875
I'll never certify your son-in-law's
poisonous food to be good food.

1005
01:16:08.291 --> 01:16:12.041
You have found out that GK
is selling poison to people.

1006
01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:17.458
But soon. you will realize
how much poison there is in GK.

1007
01:16:18.583 --> 01:16:20.750
Janani's marriage was arranged.

1008
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
It is our custom to send food
from our Hotel Sukhibhava to the orphanage

1009
01:16:25.083 --> 01:16:27.208
for any auspicious event
that takes place at home.

1010
01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:28.375
We did the same on this occasion.

1011
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:36.291
All the children who ate that food
fell seriously ill.

1012
01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:40.791
and no one knows how it happened
but it was food poisoning.

1013
01:16:42.666 --> 01:16:44.583
-Sister. increase the oxygen.
-Okay. sir.

1014
01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:46.791
-Check the saturation levels
-Raju. here.

1015
01:16:50.125 --> 01:16:50.958
It's okay.

1016
01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:01.708
HOTEL SUKHIBHAVA

1017
01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:04.583
For that reason. GK conspired
with the officials

1018
01:17:04.791 --> 01:17:07.583
-and arranged raids on Hotel Sukhibhava.
-Mr. Rajaram.

1019
01:17:07.666 --> 01:17:09.458
They planted fake goods at the place.

1020
01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:12.375
Hotel Sukhibhava was made to shut down.

1021
01:17:14.333 --> 01:17:16.083
Your elder brother was arrested

1022
01:17:16.166 --> 01:17:18.916
for poisoning orphaned children.

1023
01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:21.166
Let him go. sir.

1024
01:17:21.666 --> 01:17:23.125
-Get in the car.
-We are right behind you.

1025
01:17:29.333 --> 01:17:31.458
Your brother got out on bail and…

1026
01:17:35.791 --> 01:17:37.291
Are you hurt?

1027
01:17:37.375 --> 01:17:40.833
Even if you don't take your word back.

1028
01:17:41.166 --> 01:17:44.208
even if you don't give me
the evidence you have.

1029
01:17:44.375 --> 01:17:47.541
this pain won't stop with you.

1030
01:17:47.916 --> 01:17:51.208
I'll give it to everyone in your family.

1031
01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:56.041
I'll make sure your family
doesn't experience happiness.

1032
01:17:56.125 --> 01:18:00.583
Hey! I wouldn't have stopped
your license if I was afraid.

1033
01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:04.500
If I go to jail. my honor will be lost.
that's it.

1034
01:18:05.375 --> 01:18:07.541
But if I get scared
and let you continue your evil job.

1035
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.458
people will lose their lives.

1036
01:18:10.416 --> 01:18:12.916
For me. people's lives
are more important than my honor.

1037
01:18:13.041 --> 01:18:16.333
GK broke off Janani's engagement.

1038
01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:18.291
-Come in. brother-in-law.
-Namaste.

1039
01:18:18.375 --> 01:18:20.208
-Sit down.
-I have not come to sit down.

1040
01:18:21.416 --> 01:18:22.250
What happened?

1041
01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:25.833
When the hotel was closed. I thought
it was okay. we have enough businesses.

1042
01:18:26.416 --> 01:18:27.583
When you were arrested.

1043
01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:30.083
I thought the cases against
such well-known people in the society

1044
01:18:30.416 --> 01:18:31.750
were common and they'd come out.

1045
01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.333
But now the witness is going to give
a statement against you in court.

1046
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.416
You are bound to go to jail.

1047
01:18:38.833 --> 01:18:42.333
That's why. I have come here to say that
we want to cancel this engagement.

1048
01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:44.208
Goodbye.

1049
01:18:49.416 --> 01:18:53.083
Dear. you have come at a time
when your brother was fighting

1050
01:18:53.166 --> 01:18:56.291
a lonely battle to get out
of the false cases he has filed.

1051
01:18:58.291 --> 01:19:00.541
When so much was going on.
why did you hide all this from me?

1052
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:06.916
Uncle. under no circumstances
should Vicky be aware of our problems.

1053
01:19:07.416 --> 01:19:10.166
We don't know how much trouble
he has suffered while he was away from us.

1054
01:19:10.458 --> 01:19:12.833
Now we should not hurt him again
by telling him about our difficulties.

1055
01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:17.791
As long as he's here.
we should all look happy.

1056
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.875
The happiness I saw in all
of you should be true.

1057
01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.541
and I will make it come true.

1058
01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:29.000
But brother should not find out
that you have told me about this.

1059
01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:45.750
The person you're calling is not
answering. please call again later.

1060
01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:54.083
The person you're calling is not
answering. please call again later.

1061
01:19:54.166 --> 01:19:55.083
Did he answer?

1062
01:19:59.833 --> 01:20:03.500
Pradeep is going to get engaged
to MLA Rudra Pratap's daughter tomorrow.

1063
01:20:03.583 --> 01:20:07.625
Their father may have changed his mind.
but Pradeep is very fond of me.

1064
01:20:07.708 --> 01:20:09.750
He must have been afraid of his father
and agreed to this match.

1065
01:20:10.875 --> 01:20:14.833
Leave that fear to me.
Tell me. do you love him as well?

1066
01:20:17.916 --> 01:20:20.208
I like Pradeep very much. Uncle.

1067
01:20:24.333 --> 01:20:28.083
Be ready tomorrow. let's go
to the engagement. Okay?

1068
01:20:28.166 --> 01:20:29.833
There's still time. right?
For the auspicious time?

1069
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:30.958
Dear. you go and take some rest.

1070
01:20:31.041 --> 01:20:32.791
Take all of this off.
Brother-in-law. sit.

1071
01:20:32.875 --> 01:20:33.708
Okay.

1072
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:38.083
Hello. I'm Sambasiva Rao speaking.

1073
01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.458
Why do you want to arrange
a board meeting now?

1074
01:20:39.666 --> 01:20:42.166
Give me an hour's time.
I will give you your 50 crores.

1075
01:20:46.583 --> 01:20:47.916
Why have you come back again?

1076
01:20:48.625 --> 01:20:51.000
Are you selling your boy's life for money?

1077
01:20:51.958 --> 01:20:52.875
I know. sir.

1078
01:20:52.958 --> 01:20:55.750
You were clueless when your business
partners asked for the money

1079
01:20:55.958 --> 01:20:57.375
they had invested in your business.

1080
01:20:58.125 --> 01:21:03.250
At the same time. GK made you an offer.
Engagement with Rudra Pratap's daughter.

1081
01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:06.041
Sir. you should have spoken to my brother.

1082
01:21:06.125 --> 01:21:08.791
My problem is not so small
that you can resolve it.

1083
01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:10.000
Fifty crores.

1084
01:21:10.875 --> 01:21:14.208
I told you. son. you are not capable
of solving my problems.

1085
01:21:17.708 --> 01:21:19.625
It's time for the ritual to begin.
Please leave.

1086
01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.041
He will suffer as his destiny
has planned for him.

1087
01:21:29.666 --> 01:21:30.833
Fifty crores!

1088
01:21:39.791 --> 01:21:41.416
Sir. 50 crores?

1089
01:21:41.625 --> 01:21:44.583
Sir. the amount is here.
Your problem has been solved.

1090
01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:46.208
Don't ask for the details.

1091
01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:49.625
It's time for the auspicious time.
Please come.

1092
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.416
The money is here.
but what about Rudra Pratap?

1093
01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:54.666
I'll take care of him.

1094
01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:01.875
Who are you?

1095
01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:03.416
Shall I show you a small live show?

1096
01:22:03.791 --> 01:22:06.541
-I don't have that much time.
-Do you have time to go to jail?

1097
01:22:14.125 --> 01:22:18.333
My man is at the CBI office.
He has a pen drive with him.

1098
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:21.583
-So?
-There are some facts in it.

1099
01:22:23.791 --> 01:22:25.500
Like. in the name of your shell company.

1100
01:22:25.583 --> 01:22:29.958
you are exporting drugs in the guise
of medicines from Kolkata port.

1101
01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:34.333
It's too much to have
6.000 crores worth of scams

1102
01:22:34.666 --> 01:22:38.583
and evidence in a pen drive
that doesn't weigh sixty grams.

1103
01:22:39.208 --> 01:22:41.416
-What do you want?
-In 30 seconds.

1104
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.541
you and your people should vacate
this place and leave.

1105
01:22:44.083 --> 01:22:44.958
And the pen drive?

1106
01:22:45.041 --> 01:22:46.916
When you get home. it'll be in your hand.

1107
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:47.875
Okay.

1108
01:22:48.541 --> 01:22:49.625
Come. let's go.

1109
01:22:49.708 --> 01:22:51.250
-What happened. brother?
-Let's go. Come on.

1110
01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:52.250
Come. let's go.

1111
01:22:52.333 --> 01:22:53.208
-What happened?
-Go.

1112
01:22:53.291 --> 01:22:54.750
I need a small favor from you. sir.

1113
01:22:54.833 --> 01:22:55.791
I will definitely do it. son.

1114
01:22:55.875 --> 01:22:57.583
It would be nice if you could
call my brother

1115
01:22:57.666 --> 01:22:59.833
and tell him that the engagement that
you canceled will continue to happen.

1116
01:22:59.916 --> 01:23:00.958
I'll call him right now.

1117
01:23:01.375 --> 01:23:02.291
Thank you.

1118
01:23:02.791 --> 01:23:03.666
Come.

1119
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:04.833
Mom!

1120
01:23:05.291 --> 01:23:07.250
What happened to you?
Why are you so happy?

1121
01:23:07.333 --> 01:23:10.333
Uncle spoke to them
and they agreed to the marriage.

1122
01:23:10.416 --> 01:23:11.750
-Really?
-Yes.

1123
01:23:11.875 --> 01:23:13.916
Vicky. what is she saying?

1124
01:23:14.166 --> 01:23:15.041
It's true. sister.

1125
01:23:15.166 --> 01:23:16.625
What magic did you do?

1126
01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:20.208
It was certainly magic.
Fifty crores in a single click.

1127
01:23:21.125 --> 01:23:22.333
Fifty crores?!

1128
01:23:23.125 --> 01:23:25.000
Bhuvi!

1129
01:23:25.375 --> 01:23:27.666
They called me to arrange
the engagement in two days.

1130
01:23:28.625 --> 01:23:31.416
They said they canceled the engagement
due to some misunderstanding.

1131
01:23:31.541 --> 01:23:32.625
There are only two days left.

1132
01:23:32.958 --> 01:23:34.500
We need to do the shopping.
call the relatives.

1133
01:23:34.583 --> 01:23:36.666
-there are a lot of things to do.
-A lot.

1134
01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:38.333
-Brother. I have a small request.
-What is it?

1135
01:23:38.416 --> 01:23:41.375
Since the marriage is at home.
can we also call Bhairavi's family?

1136
01:23:41.458 --> 01:23:42.791
Do you want to just call them
or get married?

1137
01:23:42.875 --> 01:23:44.375
One plus one offer?

1138
01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:46.000
Hey. shut up.

1139
01:23:46.375 --> 01:23:47.250
Go.

1140
01:23:48.916 --> 01:23:49.958
You may call them. Vicky.

1141
01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:51.541
You don't need permission for that.

1142
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:52.625
Thank you. sister-in-law.

1143
01:24:02.041 --> 01:24:03.750
-What's the matter?
-Boss. the violin case

1144
01:24:03.833 --> 01:24:04.916
which had the gun in it is missing.

1145
01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:07.166
I don't know anything. boss.

1146
01:24:08.583 --> 01:24:09.583
Who could have taken it?

1147
01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:11.208
-What's the matter?
-Guruji.

1148
01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:13.666
I have a surprise planned
for your birthday.

1149
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:14.875
You'll be shocked to see it.

1150
01:24:14.958 --> 01:24:17.416
Did you bring the gym trainer. David?

1151
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:18.708
Why are you so obsessed with him?

1152
01:24:18.791 --> 01:24:19.875
-Then what else is it?
-No. Not yet.

1153
01:24:19.958 --> 01:24:23.833
-You have to close your eyes first.
-Okay. what crazy love you have for me.

1154
01:24:26.208 --> 01:24:27.208
You will be tempted if you see it.

1155
01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:36.458
Why are you hesitating. Savitri? Play it.

1156
01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:41.041
-You see my tension as hesitation?
-It's okay. Play it. Savitri.

1157
01:24:41.291 --> 01:24:43.291
If I use it. my fingerprints
will get on it.

1158
01:24:43.583 --> 01:24:45.750
Is it a gun that will get
your fingerprints?

1159
01:24:45.833 --> 01:24:49.666
Mr. Rajaram. your question itself
has an answer in it.

1160
01:24:49.875 --> 01:24:51.958
If I use it I won't have
my next birthday. sir.

1161
01:24:52.041 --> 01:24:52.958
Please consider that.

1162
01:24:54.708 --> 01:24:57.000
That's been your dream
since you were a child.

1163
01:24:57.083 --> 01:24:59.000
That dream is long gone. stupid!

1164
01:25:00.041 --> 01:25:01.541
But this is Vicky's personal violin.

1165
01:25:01.625 --> 01:25:03.083
It is illegal to play it
without his permission.

1166
01:25:03.166 --> 01:25:04.041
I mean it's unethical.

1167
01:25:04.125 --> 01:25:06.250
I'll tell Vicky. Purushottam.

1168
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:07.708
Take that violin and give it to him.

1169
01:25:09.125 --> 01:25:11.625
If they find the gun. there
will be mayhem in the house.

1170
01:25:11.708 --> 01:25:12.916
-Boss.
-Do something. boss.

1171
01:25:13.166 --> 01:25:15.166
Please. sir. Don't. Listen to me.

1172
01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:17.416
Don't. sir. Please!

1173
01:25:17.916 --> 01:25:21.250
Don't. sir. Please!

1174
01:25:21.625 --> 01:25:24.958
Don't. sir. Please. sir!

1175
01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:30.875
Rajaram. I have nothing
to do with this gun.

1176
01:25:30.958 --> 01:25:32.291
I have nothing to do with this gun.

1177
01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:33.791
It's not mine.

1178
01:25:33.875 --> 01:25:35.708
-I don't know anything.
-Savitri.

1179
01:25:36.291 --> 01:25:37.833
It is a violin. not a gun.

1180
01:25:38.375 --> 01:25:39.416
Have you changed it?

1181
01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.916
Who put it in his hand?

1182
01:25:42.041 --> 01:25:44.041
You put it yourself.
You put it in the dark and forgot.

1183
01:25:45.083 --> 01:25:46.583
If you don't drink.
you will get forgetful.

1184
01:25:46.666 --> 01:25:47.791
You gave the gun
and didn't give him the bullet.

1185
01:25:47.875 --> 01:25:48.750
Give the bullet.

1186
01:25:48.833 --> 01:25:50.625
-Is this called a bullet?
-Yes.

1187
01:25:50.708 --> 01:25:51.875
If you give him the gun
and not give him the bullet.

1188
01:25:51.958 --> 01:25:53.083
how will you get the sound from the gun?

1189
01:25:53.166 --> 01:25:54.916
-So give the bullet…
-Shoot.

1190
01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:57.041
How can I shoot using a violin?

1191
01:25:57.125 --> 01:25:59.333
I mean. play it. Play it.

1192
01:26:01.125 --> 01:26:02.041
Do you want me to play?

1193
01:26:02.125 --> 01:26:04.250
You hold your weapon in your hands.
why do you ask me?

1194
01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:07.541
I don't know which raga
will come out in this confusion.

1195
01:26:07.625 --> 01:26:09.708
-Wow!
-Hey. shut up.

1196
01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:11.291
He hasn't played yet.

1197
01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:13.458
Don't we have to say
the same thing even after he plays?

1198
01:26:13.541 --> 01:26:15.708
Hey. Please let me play.

1199
01:26:15.791 --> 01:26:17.083
-Play it.
-Play it.

1200
01:26:24.875 --> 01:26:29.375
-Very soothing! How well is he playing!
-He's playing very well!

1201
01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:31.791
-What raga could it be?
-I won't tell you.

1202
01:26:32.541 --> 01:26:33.375
Boss.

1203
01:26:33.666 --> 01:26:34.500
Vicky.

1204
01:26:34.666 --> 01:26:37.041
How would it be if he had a performance
at Janani's wedding?

1205
01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:43.875
-Brother. Bhairavi's family is here.
-Alright.

1206
01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:46.000
Mr. Ramarao. I will call you later.

1207
01:26:47.375 --> 01:26:48.250
My husband.

1208
01:26:49.125 --> 01:26:49.958
-Hello. sir.
-Hello. sir.

1209
01:26:50.041 --> 01:26:51.625
First. you must forgive me.

1210
01:26:51.708 --> 01:26:52.625
Why. sir?

1211
01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:55.750
Traditionally. we must come
to the girl's house and do the rituals.

1212
01:26:56.208 --> 01:26:58.666
Forgive me for bringing you here.

1213
01:26:59.291 --> 01:27:02.750
No. That's okay.
We settled in Bengal ages ago.

1214
01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:04.458
Because of you.

1215
01:27:04.541 --> 01:27:07.416
we got the opportunity to step
on the Telugu land and smell this soil.

1216
01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:12.291
No. your one question
has brought Vicky back to us.

1217
01:27:12.541 --> 01:27:14.375
That's why we should thank you.

1218
01:27:15.583 --> 01:27:17.625
Son. will you keep the guests
standing here?

1219
01:27:17.708 --> 01:27:18.541
Call them in.

1220
01:27:18.625 --> 01:27:19.791
Come in.

1221
01:27:19.875 --> 01:27:21.750
-Get the bags.
-Come on.

1222
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:27.541
I like your selection a lot.
It looks like that family is very rich.

1223
01:27:27.708 --> 01:27:29.166
You are right. sister.

1224
01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:34.125
How did such a rich family agree to take
a supervisor as their son-in-law?

1225
01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:36.583
Son. what did you show them
to convince them?

1226
01:27:36.791 --> 01:27:38.041
Is he a supervisor?

1227
01:27:39.125 --> 01:27:40.333
What did you tell them. Uncle?

1228
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.833
Do you have a bungalow?

1229
01:27:44.333 --> 01:27:45.375
I don't even have a small hut.

1230
01:27:45.458 --> 01:27:48.083
What the hell? Small hut?

1231
01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:51.000
Being the owner of so many villas. he says
that he does not even have a small hut.

1232
01:27:51.083 --> 01:27:51.916
Then. a car?

1233
01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:53.875
I don't even have an old car.

1234
01:27:54.291 --> 01:27:55.583
How else will you feed her?

1235
01:27:55.666 --> 01:27:56.958
How are you running your family?

1236
01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.875
Brother is asking something. Answer him.

1237
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.583
Somewhere. something is wrong.

1238
01:28:03.666 --> 01:28:06.583
Must be in your coconut.
I can smell it.

1239
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:10.916
Something.

1240
01:28:13.833 --> 01:28:16.750
Daddy.

1241
01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:17.916
Brother. I will be back.

1242
01:28:18.208 --> 01:28:21.333
Daddy. Vicky is lying to everyone
that he is a supervisor.

1243
01:28:21.416 --> 01:28:22.708
-Did you hear that?
-What is it?

1244
01:28:22.875 --> 01:28:25.125
-Did you hear what they were saying?
-What?

1245
01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:27.875
Dad. did you hear
what they were talking about?

1246
01:28:28.958 --> 01:28:30.000
-Oh. God!
-Tell me.

1247
01:28:30.541 --> 01:28:31.958
You haven't put up your hearing aid yet?

1248
01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:32.958
Why are you shouting?

1249
01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:34.916
These things you can clearly hear?!

1250
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:35.833
It's a waste talking to you.

1251
01:28:35.916 --> 01:28:37.708
I'll tell this to the one
who must know this. Go!

1252
01:28:37.791 --> 01:28:40.125
-Grandpa Shukla.
-Bokadia.

1253
01:28:40.208 --> 01:28:42.291
I shouldn't be quiet at all.
I must immediately--

1254
01:28:42.375 --> 01:28:43.333
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

1255
01:28:43.875 --> 01:28:45.041
I am going there!

1256
01:28:45.125 --> 01:28:46.708
It's good for us to make that decision

1257
01:28:46.791 --> 01:28:48.916
-To expose your friend's fraud.
-Which fraud?

1258
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.291
-Aren't you lying to your elder brother?
-Not a single lie was told.

1259
01:28:55.375 --> 01:28:59.083
If I prove that you lied.
I will slap you once for each lie.

1260
01:28:59.666 --> 01:29:02.041
-If proven true?
-Then I would take two slaps.

1261
01:29:02.125 --> 01:29:02.958
Now. ask me.

1262
01:29:03.208 --> 01:29:05.083
When you have so many villas in Bengal.

1263
01:29:05.166 --> 01:29:09.166
why did you tell your brother that
you don't have a small house?

1264
01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:13.291
Look. Bokadia. I have villas in Bengal.
There is not even a single small house.

1265
01:29:13.375 --> 01:29:14.208
Yes. that's true.

1266
01:29:14.291 --> 01:29:15.416
-Right.
-Oh no!

1267
01:29:16.541 --> 01:29:17.416
Second question.

1268
01:29:18.875 --> 01:29:21.416
You have so many cars in Bengal.

1269
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.791
so why did you tell them that
you don't even own an old car?

1270
01:29:23.875 --> 01:29:25.375
Oh. my Bengali sweetie.

1271
01:29:26.125 --> 01:29:29.958
I own only a Mercedes Benz in Bengal.
Do I own any old cars?

1272
01:29:30.041 --> 01:29:31.291
-No.
-Right.

1273
01:29:31.375 --> 01:29:32.333
Oh no!

1274
01:29:33.541 --> 01:29:34.500
Stop it.

1275
01:29:36.125 --> 01:29:39.208
The bet was only two slaps for each lie.
Why did you give me four?

1276
01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:41.000
It was two each.

1277
01:29:43.708 --> 01:29:44.583
Why is he laughing?

1278
01:29:45.041 --> 01:29:46.958
You guys are so stupid.

1279
01:29:47.208 --> 01:29:50.250
If it was two per person
then you are three people.

1280
01:29:50.333 --> 01:29:51.416
and what are three twos?

1281
01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.250
-Six.
-Then you gave me just four slaps.

1282
01:29:54.083 --> 01:29:55.791
Correct. You're a genius.

1283
01:29:55.875 --> 01:29:56.791
I like you.

1284
01:29:59.791 --> 01:30:00.916
Enough?

1285
01:30:01.041 --> 01:30:04.250
Not enough.
I am a little bit confused.

1286
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.416
I will come later.

1287
01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:07.333
Do you want me to clear up your confusion?

1288
01:30:07.791 --> 01:30:10.416
-I have some work.
-We don't have work.

1289
01:30:11.166 --> 01:30:14.333
This is what it means to get yourself
thrashed by your own stupidity.

1290
01:30:14.666 --> 01:30:16.416
You are great. sir.

1291
01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:20.291
You lied to them and later convinced me
that all the lies were true?!

1292
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.250
What is your strategy. sir?

1293
01:30:22.333 --> 01:30:24.250
Can you tell him our strategy?

1294
01:30:24.333 --> 01:30:25.166
Okay. boss.

1295
01:30:28.291 --> 01:30:30.125
-Now. he'll tell you.
-Okay.

1296
01:30:30.208 --> 01:30:32.291
My boss has two policies.

1297
01:30:32.375 --> 01:30:33.333
-What is that?
-First.

1298
01:30:33.666 --> 01:30:35.791
If someone is equal to him.

1299
01:30:35.875 --> 01:30:37.708
he would thrash them in such a way
that they wake up on a stretcher.

1300
01:30:37.791 --> 01:30:38.625
Second?

1301
01:30:39.708 --> 01:30:41.333
If he is someone like you.

1302
01:30:41.666 --> 01:30:44.375
then he will make him go mad
so that you wake up in a mental hospital.

1303
01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:47.375
Stupid fellow.

1304
01:30:47.458 --> 01:30:49.583
You're messing with the wrong person.

1305
01:31:07.541 --> 01:31:08.750
Take it. please.

1306
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:13.375
Mr. Rajaram. you are more noble
than we had heard about.

1307
01:31:15.416 --> 01:31:18.791
We couldn't have got a better family
than yours for our Bhairavi.

1308
01:31:23.375 --> 01:31:24.458
We will take your leave.

1309
01:31:24.791 --> 01:31:26.500
Mr. Shukla. you can leave later.

1310
01:31:26.875 --> 01:31:33.000
Since you have come this far.
let's make their formal engagement.

1311
01:31:33.083 --> 01:31:33.958
Right?

1312
01:31:35.625 --> 01:31:38.250
If an elderly person like you insists.
I can't say no.

1313
01:31:38.625 --> 01:31:40.083
-Let's do it.
-That's it!

1314
01:31:58.250 --> 01:32:01.750
The chains tying up the legs
Is the Venus that lights up the sky

1315
01:32:01.833 --> 01:32:05.125
Doesn't light up. it's a shadow
It's not a shadow. it's a deep well

1316
01:32:05.208 --> 01:32:08.583
The chains tying up the legs
Is the Venus that lights up the sky

1317
01:32:08.666 --> 01:32:12.250
Doesn't light up. it's a shadow
It's not a shadow. it's a deep well

1318
01:32:12.333 --> 01:32:13.958
Oh. my Monalisa

1319
01:32:14.041 --> 01:32:15.625
Your hip is as smooth as the black bead

1320
01:32:15.708 --> 01:32:19.125
Let's whisper to each other
As nobody can hear us

1321
01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:29.416
Oh. my Monalisa
Your age is as sweet as a nightingale

1322
01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:32.833
Come let's sing a melodious song

1323
01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:41.250
Will I say no to you?

1324
01:32:41.333 --> 01:32:46.375
Just whistle to me and I'll jump the wall

1325
01:32:46.458 --> 01:32:49.791
Call me to be with you
And I'll come with my luggage packed

1326
01:32:49.875 --> 01:32:52.708
How can I stay without you?

1327
01:32:52.791 --> 01:32:59.750
I fell in love freshly
While I was in Kolkata I lost my mind

1328
01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:03.583
Oh. my cannonball flower
You are a walking piece of art

1329
01:33:03.666 --> 01:33:07.041
Like the moon follows Lord Shiva
I follow you

1330
01:33:07.125 --> 01:33:10.500
Oh. my cannonball flower
You are a walking piece of art

1331
01:33:10.583 --> 01:33:13.875
Like the moon follows Lord Shiva
I follow you

1332
01:33:13.958 --> 01:33:17.291
Oh. my Monalisa
Your age is as sweet as a nightingale

1333
01:33:17.375 --> 01:33:20.791
Come let's sing a melodious song

1334
01:33:56.708 --> 01:34:00.083
I am blushing when you come onto me

1335
01:34:00.166 --> 01:34:03.166
My body gets heated up
When you are near me

1336
01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:06.500
Keep that hesitation aside
We don't need it

1337
01:34:06.583 --> 01:34:10.458
Let's douse off the heat
That is generated in your body

1338
01:34:10.541 --> 01:34:13.833
'How do I stop you?

1339
01:34:13.916 --> 01:34:15.708
How do I stop you?

1340
01:34:15.791 --> 01:34:19.708
How do I pull myself
Into this chaotic game of romance

1341
01:34:19.791 --> 01:34:24.208
Come!

1342
01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:27.583
Oh. my cannonball flower
You are a walking piece of art

1343
01:34:27.666 --> 01:34:31.083
Like the moon follows Lord Shiva
I follow you

1344
01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:34.458
Oh. my cannonball flower
You are a walking piece of art

1345
01:34:34.541 --> 01:34:38.000
Like the moon follows Lord Shiva
I follow you

1346
01:34:53.916 --> 01:34:56.333
The number you're calling is either…

1347
01:34:56.416 --> 01:34:58.583
Pick up the call. Ravindra.

1348
01:34:58.666 --> 01:34:59.875
-Son-in-law.
-Shit!

1349
01:34:59.958 --> 01:35:04.375
It takes time to go to a new place and
find information about a new person.

1350
01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:07.708
Why are you so worried?

1351
01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:09.083
Sir. Ravindra is here.

1352
01:35:09.166 --> 01:35:10.000
Really?

1353
01:35:10.416 --> 01:35:12.416
What's the matter. Ravindra?
You have come so early.

1354
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.208
Sir. There is no one in Kolkata
who does not know him. sir.

1355
01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:17.541
So my work became easier
and I came quickly.

1356
01:35:17.708 --> 01:35:19.291
Sir. your guess was right.
He is very famous there.

1357
01:35:26.333 --> 01:35:29.458
Vicky Bhai is Chhatrapati Shivaji
of Kalighat.

1358
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.541
I went to Kalighat.
the place where he lived.

1359
01:35:32.625 --> 01:35:35.083
There I met his business partner Gupta.

1360
01:35:35.708 --> 01:35:36.958
I lied to him that I was a journalist

1361
01:35:37.041 --> 01:35:38.791
and that I wanted to write
a story about Vicky Bhai.

1362
01:35:38.875 --> 01:35:40.916
Then he told me about an incident. sir.

1363
01:35:42.125 --> 01:35:45.458
Then I understood
why he became Vicky Bhai there.

1364
01:35:45.541 --> 01:35:46.875
Kalighat is ours.

1365
01:35:47.125 --> 01:35:50.458
We've been living here for so many years.
and we won't evacuate.

1366
01:35:50.541 --> 01:35:53.166
Sir! Your hotel must be worth 400 crores.

1367
01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:54.833
But our emotions are worth
four generations.

1368
01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:57.291
It's not fair on your behalf
to do this despite a court stay.

1369
01:35:58.583 --> 01:36:01.208
If you believe in the court order.

1370
01:36:02.666 --> 01:36:04.125
I believe in Mukherjee.

1371
01:36:07.166 --> 01:36:11.833
This Mukherjee is ready to kill any number
of people for those who believe in him.

1372
01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:16.416
And will the Vicky. whom you believe in.
come to your rescue?

1373
01:37:08.666 --> 01:37:09.666
Hey!

1374
01:37:10.375 --> 01:37:12.791
If I see you again in this area.

1375
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:16.458
I'll rip off your heads and hang them
as a garland to the Goddess.

1376
01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:18.375
Leave!

1377
01:37:22.833 --> 01:37:25.791
When I was hungry. Kalighat fed me.

1378
01:37:26.708 --> 01:37:28.250
When I was alone. it gave me shelter.

1379
01:37:28.666 --> 01:37:32.083
I am not grateful to be able to help
when there is a difficulty in Kalighat.

1380
01:37:32.875 --> 01:37:34.750
-It's my responsibility.
-Thanks. son.

1381
01:37:35.041 --> 01:37:37.250
What a unique character!

1382
01:37:37.333 --> 01:37:40.041
He did all this just
because he was fed one meal?

1383
01:37:40.125 --> 01:37:43.458
And you closed his brother's hotel
and deprived so many people of food.

1384
01:37:43.541 --> 01:37:44.625
What would he do to you?

1385
01:38:00.125 --> 01:38:01.125
What. Ravindra?

1386
01:38:03.625 --> 01:38:05.041
Did your journey to Kolkata go well?

1387
01:38:06.208 --> 01:38:07.083
By the way.

1388
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:10.083
it was GK who sent you
to Kolkata to find out about me.

1389
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:14.958
But it was I who let you come back
to Hyderabad alive.

1390
01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:22.166
Because GK needs to know about me.

1391
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:27.166
GK. everyone lives
for the sake of victory.

1392
01:38:28.166 --> 01:38:33.000
But he lives with an ambition
of doing good to other people.

1393
01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.541
People like my elder brother
are very rare.

1394
01:38:35.833 --> 01:38:39.708
If my brother's smile gets wiped off.
I'll get disturbed.

1395
01:38:40.875 --> 01:38:43.750
When you were a child.
your Uncle Paparao once disturbed me.

1396
01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:46.833
Now you're disturbing me again.

1397
01:38:48.541 --> 01:38:49.583
Don't. GK.

1398
01:38:50.875 --> 01:38:52.125
Don't meddle in my business.

1399
01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:54.583
Was that a warning?

1400
01:38:54.666 --> 01:38:57.708
I'm not the one who is meddling
in your business. it's you.

1401
01:38:57.958 --> 01:38:59.375
I repeat.

1402
01:38:59.791 --> 01:39:03.291
I'm going to wipe
that smile out of your family

1403
01:39:03.416 --> 01:39:06.916
and make them suffer
in front of your eyes.

1404
01:39:07.791 --> 01:39:09.583
I dare you to stop it.

1405
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:12.250
Laugh well. my friend.

1406
01:39:13.375 --> 01:39:18.416
Suppose I find the man
who poisoned our hotel food.

1407
01:39:19.375 --> 01:39:20.916
will that smile remain?

1408
01:39:22.916 --> 01:39:25.458
If our closed hotel gets opened.

1409
01:39:26.041 --> 01:39:28.291
if the truths you're hiding
are exposed to this world.

1410
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:31.750
and your empire collapses
in front of your eyes.

1411
01:39:32.291 --> 01:39:33.666
Will that smile remain?

1412
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.833
You see. the smile on your face dropped
when I told you what was going to happen.

1413
01:39:40.666 --> 01:39:41.833
That's why I'm telling you.

1414
01:39:42.708 --> 01:39:45.958
smile happily. take a picture now.
and get it framed.

1415
01:39:46.833 --> 01:39:50.750
Because later you won't be able
to smile even if you wanted to.

1416
01:39:51.541 --> 01:39:53.000
Because I won't let you.

1417
01:39:57.333 --> 01:39:58.666
It's a little strong.

1418
01:39:59.625 --> 01:40:00.583
but it's good. drink it.

1419
01:40:08.958 --> 01:40:09.833
Hey!

1420
01:40:11.041 --> 01:40:12.458
GK. you're meddling with my brother…

1421
01:40:15.041 --> 01:40:16.916
but you will have to face me.

1422
01:40:18.166 --> 01:40:19.125
All the best.

1423
01:40:24.083 --> 01:40:25.041
Breaking news!

1424
01:40:25.291 --> 01:40:30.416
In Rajaram's case. the kids who ate
poisoned food are in a serious condition.

1425
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:34.708
In the case of anybody's death.
Rajaram is certain to get a life sentence.

1426
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:39.333
There is a possibility of permanent
closure of the Sukhibhava Hotels.

1427
01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:43.083
It's okay now.

1428
01:40:43.166 --> 01:40:44.000
-What is this. doctor?
-Okay. sir.

1429
01:40:44.083 --> 01:40:46.083
Why aren't the kids recovering?

1430
01:40:46.166 --> 01:40:47.916
We don't know what kind of poison
was added to the food.

1431
01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:50.916
and what sort of chemicals
were present in the poison.

1432
01:40:51.083 --> 01:40:53.208
That's why the treatment
has been a trial and error process.

1433
01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:57.708
Some are responding
but some kids' condition is worsening.

1434
01:40:58.166 --> 01:41:01.541
Anyway. we have called specialists
from AIIMS Delhi to help us.

1435
01:41:01.875 --> 01:41:03.000
Let's hope for the best. sir.

1436
01:41:03.375 --> 01:41:06.333
Doctor. don't worry about the payment
of the specialists.

1437
01:41:06.416 --> 01:41:07.416
I'll bear the cost.

1438
01:41:07.583 --> 01:41:08.916
I appreciate your kind heart.

1439
01:41:09.208 --> 01:41:10.458
We'll do our best to bring them on.

1440
01:41:10.541 --> 01:41:11.583
-Thank you. doctor.
-Not a problem.

1441
01:41:11.666 --> 01:41:12.583
-Thank you.
-Okay.

1442
01:41:17.458 --> 01:41:18.291
Okay. sir.

1443
01:41:19.083 --> 01:41:19.916
Mr. Lawyer.

1444
01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:22.416
Oh. your brother just left.

1445
01:41:22.625 --> 01:41:23.833
It's okay.

1446
01:41:25.666 --> 01:41:27.208
I have to speak to you personally.

1447
01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:30.958
In the case of the food poisoning
that took place in the orphanage.

1448
01:41:31.625 --> 01:41:34.541
the food inspector filed a complaint
that some adulterated chemicals

1449
01:41:35.125 --> 01:41:36.541
were mixed in the food eaten
by the children.

1450
01:41:37.625 --> 01:41:39.416
Someone must've poisoned the food!

1451
01:41:40.208 --> 01:41:42.458
Didn't they find a single clue
in the police investigation?

1452
01:41:42.791 --> 01:41:45.416
GK stopped the investigation midway.

1453
01:41:46.291 --> 01:41:48.583
But if you find out who did it.
all the facts will come out.

1454
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.791
That is the only way to prove that
my brother is innocent and GK is guilty.

1455
01:41:53.375 --> 01:41:55.250
-No. there's another way.
-What?

1456
01:41:58.041 --> 01:41:58.958
Who is this?

1457
01:41:59.041 --> 01:42:02.416
He is a scientist who worked
at GK Foods for some time.

1458
01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:03.416
His name is Mahesh.

1459
01:42:04.208 --> 01:42:06.333
He researched about the adulteration
that was going on there

1460
01:42:06.416 --> 01:42:08.333
and the health problems it caused.

1461
01:42:08.708 --> 01:42:11.333
When your brother gave a statement
that GK foods are bad.

1462
01:42:11.791 --> 01:42:14.750
Mahesh came and met your brother.

1463
01:42:14.916 --> 01:42:17.375
All of the allegations that you made
on GK are correct. sir.

1464
01:42:17.458 --> 01:42:19.875
They're buying adulterated products
from China.

1465
01:42:19.958 --> 01:42:21.916
bringing them to our country.
and using them without people's knowledge.

1466
01:42:22.333 --> 01:42:25.333
Palm Olein oil is used
instead of palm oil in chips.

1467
01:42:25.416 --> 01:42:26.791
this actually causes cancer.

1468
01:42:27.208 --> 01:42:29.166
Chinese salt and Ajinomoto are used.

1469
01:42:29.250 --> 01:42:32.541
This stops the brain from functioning.
in young people and adults alike.

1470
01:42:32.625 --> 01:42:34.791
The brain stops working slowly.

1471
01:42:34.875 --> 01:42:38.125
So I am preparing a detailed report
on every single product of GK's.

1472
01:42:38.208 --> 01:42:41.041
I'll come and see you
when all the reports are ready. sir.

1473
01:42:41.208 --> 01:42:43.166
Until then my phone will be switched off.

1474
01:42:43.458 --> 01:42:45.666
GK's men are looking for me.

1475
01:42:46.166 --> 01:42:48.541
I'll come and meet you
at the right time. sir.

1476
01:42:48.625 --> 01:42:50.250
He didn't make contact after that.

1477
01:42:50.625 --> 01:42:53.125
No matter how hard we tried.
we couldn't find his details.

1478
01:42:53.791 --> 01:42:57.291
My suspicion is that he might
have been caught by GK's men.

1479
01:42:58.458 --> 01:42:59.333
No. sir.

1480
01:43:00.083 --> 01:43:01.583
The one who mixed poison in the food

1481
01:43:01.666 --> 01:43:04.666
and that scientist. Mahesh.
both of them are GK's fears.

1482
01:43:05.458 --> 01:43:09.208
GK still fears my brother
because they both are alive.

1483
01:43:10.333 --> 01:43:12.458
First of all. we must catch that person
who mixed poison in food.

1484
01:43:12.958 --> 01:43:13.916
later everything will come out.

1485
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.291
But whatever you do.

1486
01:43:15.375 --> 01:43:17.375
you have to do it before
the final hearing of the case.

1487
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.500
-Hello.
-Hello.

1488
01:43:29.125 --> 01:43:31.916
Uncle. who cooked the food
for the orphanage that day?

1489
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:32.833
It's me. son.

1490
01:43:32.916 --> 01:43:34.500
After the dishes were ready that day.

1491
01:43:34.583 --> 01:43:37.875
Mr. Rajaram tasted it as usual
and approved it.

1492
01:43:38.250 --> 01:43:40.125
Who took the food to the ashram that day?

1493
01:43:40.208 --> 01:43:42.833
-Here.
-It's me. sir. But that day…

1494
01:43:44.041 --> 01:43:45.708
-What happened?
-On my way to the orphanage.

1495
01:43:45.791 --> 01:43:47.500
I came to know that my daughter had
met with an accident that day

1496
01:43:47.583 --> 01:43:48.458
and was admitted to the hospital.

1497
01:43:48.541 --> 01:43:49.708
Then who took the food?

1498
01:43:51.333 --> 01:43:52.291
Bailu Raju.

1499
01:43:52.625 --> 01:43:54.833
He's Bailu Raju! He is the one
who takes care of all our restaurants.

1500
01:43:54.916 --> 01:43:56.000
-Hello. sir.
-Hello.

1501
01:43:57.375 --> 01:44:01.041
Bailu Raju is our man.
then when was the food poisoned?

1502
01:44:01.625 --> 01:44:03.625
Bhai. I forgot.
How's your baby feeling now?

1503
01:44:03.708 --> 01:44:05.875
With God's grace. she is fine now.

1504
01:44:05.958 --> 01:44:08.875
The man who caused the accident
that day took her to the hospital.

1505
01:44:08.958 --> 01:44:10.083
he paid all the bills himself.

1506
01:44:10.166 --> 01:44:11.000
He is a good man. sir.

1507
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:12.875
Do you know him?

1508
01:44:13.041 --> 01:44:13.916
I don't know him. sir.

1509
01:44:14.083 --> 01:44:15.250
He is from UP.

1510
01:44:15.375 --> 01:44:17.500
There's a small truck.
He is a good driver.

1511
01:44:17.958 --> 01:44:19.250
-Driver?
-Yes. sir.

1512
01:44:23.625 --> 01:44:24.541
Where is he?

1513
01:44:30.208 --> 01:44:32.166
Does Amit stay in this vicinity?

1514
01:44:32.250 --> 01:44:34.541
Yes. sir. Look. there he is.

1515
01:44:35.333 --> 01:44:36.208
Okay.

1516
01:44:37.791 --> 01:44:38.625
Amit?

1517
01:44:39.458 --> 01:44:40.708
Who are you?

1518
01:44:40.875 --> 01:44:41.958
You have to get into an accident.

1519
01:44:42.125 --> 01:44:43.000
What?

1520
01:44:44.791 --> 01:44:46.333
You have to take the victim
to the hospital as well.

1521
01:44:46.708 --> 01:44:47.625
How much will you take?

1522
01:44:47.916 --> 01:44:49.250
Who did you come for. sir?

1523
01:44:49.333 --> 01:44:52.083
I'm not that kind of a person.
I am an honest man who does honest work.

1524
01:44:52.333 --> 01:44:53.375
Will you do it for GK?

1525
01:44:53.458 --> 01:44:54.416
Who GK?

1526
01:44:54.791 --> 01:44:55.750
What are you talking about?

1527
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.166
Please leave. sir. Mind your own business.

1528
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:59.583
If Bailu Raju asks…

1529
01:45:00.875 --> 01:45:02.000
I know everything.

1530
01:45:02.375 --> 01:45:04.541
-Bailu Raju confessed everything.
-That Bailu Raju!

1531
01:45:04.625 --> 01:45:06.541
He promised me he would tell no one.
I must kill him first.

1532
01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.708
Call him! Now!

1533
01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:16.416
Sir. a person named GK has asked for you.

1534
01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.541
Talk to him. sir.

1535
01:45:17.791 --> 01:45:18.625
GK?

1536
01:45:20.625 --> 01:45:21.458
Hello!

1537
01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:27.750
Mukherjee. if you want to take revenge
on Vicky. brute force isn't enough.

1538
01:45:28.041 --> 01:45:29.291
you need a plan.

1539
01:45:29.375 --> 01:45:30.333
What's the plan?

1540
01:45:30.583 --> 01:45:32.458
He has a family here.

1541
01:45:35.083 --> 01:45:37.666
They all love him.

1542
01:45:38.625 --> 01:45:42.458
He is devoted to his elder brother.
that's the plan.

1543
01:45:44.666 --> 01:45:47.333
If you add vengeance to my plan.

1544
01:45:47.791 --> 01:45:49.625
the poison will become more powerful.

1545
01:45:50.125 --> 01:45:51.208
Come soon.

1546
01:45:51.333 --> 01:45:52.625
We shall take care of him together.

1547
01:45:53.041 --> 01:45:53.916
Okay.

1548
01:46:08.791 --> 01:46:10.750
Welcome to Hyderabad. Mr. Mukherjee.

1549
01:46:11.541 --> 01:46:14.166
The enemy's enemy is our friend.

1550
01:46:14.458 --> 01:46:15.333
What's the plan?

1551
01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:18.333
Excuse me.

1552
01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:20.500
tell me. Bailu Raju.

1553
01:46:20.583 --> 01:46:21.500
Sir.

1554
01:46:21.583 --> 01:46:23.666
Vicky found Amit. sir.

1555
01:46:24.708 --> 01:46:26.375
He told him everything about me.

1556
01:46:26.708 --> 01:46:28.666
Vicky will surely come and find me.

1557
01:46:29.041 --> 01:46:30.291
Calm down.

1558
01:46:31.958 --> 01:46:36.125
Leave immediately
and come to our SAS iTower.

1559
01:46:36.583 --> 01:46:39.291
Our men will come and pick you up.

1560
01:46:39.833 --> 01:46:42.375
They will send you to Dubai tonight.

1561
01:46:42.625 --> 01:46:44.291
Okay. sir. I'll be there. sir.

1562
01:46:47.375 --> 01:46:48.875
We have found the bait.

1563
01:46:49.250 --> 01:46:51.583
the shark will automatically come.

1564
01:46:51.666 --> 01:46:52.708
What's the plan?

1565
01:46:53.125 --> 01:46:54.750
-Hey. Reddy.
-Sir?

1566
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.791
Call Vicky and tell him
the location of Bailu Raju.

1567
01:47:07.166 --> 01:47:08.000
Hello.

1568
01:47:08.083 --> 01:47:09.416
I know that you are looking
for Bailu Raju.

1569
01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.541
he is hiding in the SAS building
in Nanakramguda.

1570
01:47:11.791 --> 01:47:13.958
GK's men are trying to kill him.

1571
01:47:14.041 --> 01:47:15.750
You go and rescue him right away. sir.

1572
01:47:15.833 --> 01:47:18.375
-Who are you?
-I am Mr. Rajaram's well-wisher.

1573
01:47:23.708 --> 01:47:29.916
If he is Rajaram's well-wisher
then he should call him as well. right?

1574
01:47:30.958 --> 01:47:32.375
I understood. son-in-law.

1575
01:47:50.291 --> 01:47:51.125
Where is he?

1576
01:47:52.208 --> 01:47:53.166
Look.

1577
01:47:53.666 --> 01:47:54.583
Check out!

1578
01:47:56.333 --> 01:47:57.208
Look there.

1579
01:47:57.375 --> 01:48:00.666
-Guys. come on.
-Mr. GK. our men are trying to kill me.

1580
01:48:03.666 --> 01:48:04.833
Why are you hitting me?

1581
01:48:27.625 --> 01:48:28.833
Hey. stop.

1582
01:48:30.583 --> 01:48:31.416
Stop.

1583
01:48:39.708 --> 01:48:40.541
Hey!

1584
01:48:46.125 --> 01:48:47.000
Hey!

1585
01:48:52.958 --> 01:48:55.166
-Hey. I'll kill you. idiot.
-Vicky.

1586
01:48:56.291 --> 01:48:57.125
Vicky.

1587
01:48:57.416 --> 01:48:59.000
Vicky. please forgive me.

1588
01:48:59.208 --> 01:49:01.333
I got greedy for a better future
for my kids.

1589
01:49:01.958 --> 01:49:04.375
Please take me to court alive.

1590
01:49:04.458 --> 01:49:05.708
I will become a witness.

1591
01:49:05.791 --> 01:49:07.958
I will reveal all of GK's evil plans.

1592
01:49:08.041 --> 01:49:09.583
Please. save me.

1593
01:50:28.208 --> 01:50:32.625
The injuries you gave to my son
on his body have healed. but…

1594
01:50:33.125 --> 01:50:38.041
the wound on my pride in Kolkata
hasn't healed yet.

1595
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:15.833
Let me go. please. Don't harm me.

1596
01:51:48.583 --> 01:51:50.458
Bailu Raju.

1597
01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:53.333
-Bailu Raju.
-Take me to the court.

1598
01:52:00.041 --> 01:52:02.041
Please. let my father go.

1599
01:52:02.125 --> 01:52:03.958
We'll stay out of your way from now on.
Please. Vicky.

1600
01:52:06.791 --> 01:52:07.708
Vicky!

1601
01:52:27.916 --> 01:52:29.666
AMRUTA NILAYAM

1602
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.875
If I had known him beforehand.

1603
01:52:35.791 --> 01:52:37.666
I wouldn't have asked him to call you.

1604
01:52:39.875 --> 01:52:41.416
Even after knowing the truth.

1605
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.958
it would be cheating
to marry Bhairavi to him.

1606
01:52:45.583 --> 01:52:47.291
I don't think that's good.

1607
01:52:50.041 --> 01:52:51.541
I made a mistake.

1608
01:52:52.250 --> 01:52:53.250
I'm sorry.

1609
01:53:12.583 --> 01:53:18.166
You took control of my business
in the port area. defeated my forces.

1610
01:53:18.250 --> 01:53:20.708
and now you're here enjoying
yourself with your family.

1611
01:53:44.791 --> 01:53:47.000
Vicky. what's all this?

1612
01:53:48.541 --> 01:53:50.708
What your brother is saying about you.
is that true?

1613
01:53:51.166 --> 01:53:54.208
He sent Bhairavi's family away saying
that the marriage would not take place.

1614
01:53:56.958 --> 01:53:59.541
They trusted us. Bhuvana. not him.

1615
01:54:06.541 --> 01:54:07.708
What's this?

1616
01:54:08.833 --> 01:54:10.583
Is the Vicky we saw true?

1617
01:54:12.250 --> 01:54:13.791
Is it true what he is saying?

1618
01:54:14.333 --> 01:54:15.458
Both are true.

1619
01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:18.250
Both of them are me.

1620
01:54:20.208 --> 01:54:22.250
It is true that I have not changed
as my brother said.

1621
01:54:24.083 --> 01:54:25.500
it is true that I loved Bhairavi.

1622
01:54:26.166 --> 01:54:27.791
It is also true that
I want to be with all of you.

1623
01:54:27.875 --> 01:54:29.416
and also that I want to be happy with you.

1624
01:54:32.250 --> 01:54:34.208
Does that mean what I saw
with my eyes was a lie?

1625
01:54:34.791 --> 01:54:35.666
No. brother.

1626
01:54:36.791 --> 01:54:38.375
Do you know the difference
between you and me?

1627
01:54:39.208 --> 01:54:41.791
As a child. you wanted to show
me the world with your own eyes.

1628
01:54:42.791 --> 01:54:44.250
and I wanted to see it with my own eyes.

1629
01:54:46.291 --> 01:54:47.541
If someone raises their voice.
I'd raise my head.

1630
01:54:47.625 --> 01:54:48.666
If they lift their hand. I'd lift my leg.

1631
01:54:48.750 --> 01:54:50.666
Attack for attack. cheating for cheating.

1632
01:54:51.583 --> 01:54:53.250
Are you justifying your mistakes?

1633
01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:55.166
I am telling you what I did was not wrong.

1634
01:54:57.750 --> 01:55:00.416
I lied to you because you would be hurt
if I told you what I did.

1635
01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.125
If I knew your problem. I would be hurt.
that's why you made everyone lie to me.

1636
01:55:11.291 --> 01:55:12.791
We have both hidden the truth.

1637
01:55:14.958 --> 01:55:19.041
Listen. a life-giving lie has more
value than the truth.

1638
01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.500
And. the truth that takes life
is more dangerous than a lie.

1639
01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:29.833
Would you have let me stay at home
if I had told you the truth?

1640
01:55:32.833 --> 01:55:37.166
You stopped at being good at heart.
honest. and pure at soul.

1641
01:55:38.125 --> 01:55:39.416
The world has changed.

1642
01:55:40.666 --> 01:55:42.750
You could gain respect with politeness.

1643
01:55:43.333 --> 01:55:45.083
but today respect is given to one
who raises his hand.

1644
01:55:46.125 --> 01:55:48.833
Once upon a time. evidence was needed
to prove that wrong is wrong.

1645
01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:52.125
Now we need evidence
to prove the truth is the truth.

1646
01:55:52.833 --> 01:55:53.750
We have to change.

1647
01:55:54.583 --> 01:55:57.125
We have to change along with the world.

1648
01:55:58.750 --> 01:56:00.291
If I don't change. will you kill me?

1649
01:56:01.791 --> 01:56:05.583
This house has some ideals.
this family has some values.

1650
01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:08.333
He who doesn't follow them
doesn't deserve to be here.

1651
01:56:11.041 --> 01:56:11.916
Get out.

1652
01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:15.416
Son!

1653
01:56:15.833 --> 01:56:16.666
Brother-in-law.

1654
01:56:19.833 --> 01:56:20.708
Dear.

1655
01:56:21.916 --> 01:56:23.666
What are you saying?

1656
01:56:25.041 --> 01:56:27.958
I can't accept adulteration
in the food I eat.

1657
01:56:28.166 --> 01:56:30.958
Do you want to keep
an adulterated person at home?

1658
01:56:31.375 --> 01:56:32.541
Tell him to leave.

1659
01:56:48.708 --> 01:56:49.541
Why should I go?

1660
01:56:49.625 --> 01:56:51.166
I'm staying here. Tell him I won't go.

1661
01:56:55.291 --> 01:56:57.125
He can do yagnas for me to come back.

1662
01:56:57.291 --> 01:56:59.416
My sister-in-law can pray to every
God for my well-being.

1663
01:56:59.708 --> 01:57:01.875
But. is it wrong for me to stand up
when this house was in trouble?

1664
01:57:02.166 --> 01:57:04.041
Don't I have any responsibility or right?

1665
01:57:04.125 --> 01:57:05.875
You do. When?

1666
01:57:06.916 --> 01:57:09.875
When you're honest.
When you don't cheat anyone.

1667
01:57:11.625 --> 01:57:14.333
In this house.
we never talked about rights

1668
01:57:14.416 --> 01:57:18.375
except about love.
respect. and responsibility.

1669
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:22.250
If you want your rights…

1670
01:57:23.791 --> 01:57:25.125
then I'll get out of here.

1671
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.958
Dear. stop him.

1672
01:57:43.583 --> 01:57:44.458
Vicky!

1673
01:57:44.541 --> 01:57:46.250
Vicky. stop.

1674
01:57:54.250 --> 01:57:57.000
I thought my brother would be happy
if I stayed at home all these days.

1675
01:57:58.458 --> 01:58:00.875
If my brother will be happy
only if I leave the house.

1676
01:58:01.625 --> 01:58:02.958
I won't stay here for a single second.

1677
01:58:03.583 --> 01:58:04.458
Vicky!

1678
01:58:08.291 --> 01:58:10.791
You are used to living without me
for all these years.

1679
01:58:12.708 --> 01:58:14.541
Similarly. I'm used to loneliness.

1680
01:58:48.375 --> 01:58:53.666
Oh. Rama's arrow. who left the bow

1681
01:58:54.416 --> 01:59:01.083
Did your journey stumble?

1682
01:59:02.250 --> 01:59:08.041
Oh. Rama's arrow. who left the bow

1683
01:59:08.375 --> 01:59:15.208
Did your journey stumble?

1684
01:59:16.291 --> 01:59:22.916
The unity between both brothers

1685
01:59:23.291 --> 01:59:27.166
The unity between both brothers
Was comparable

1686
01:59:27.250 --> 01:59:30.333
To the legendary bond
Of Rama and Lakshmana

1687
01:59:30.416 --> 01:59:37.416
Within seconds a bond of ages
Has been broken

1688
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:44.166
Who wrote this unfortunate fate?

1689
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:47.791
Eating these reminds me
of my childhood memories.

1690
01:59:47.916 --> 01:59:54.583
But this tragedy is not new for him
He is used to it

1691
01:59:54.791 --> 01:59:58.416
Both of them are good men

1692
01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:01.750
But the ways chosen by them are different

1693
02:00:01.958 --> 02:00:05.375
An evil eye might have fallen on them

1694
02:00:05.458 --> 02:00:10.166
They both now travel on separate paths

1695
02:00:12.250 --> 02:00:19.250
A soul without a body on one side

1696
02:00:20.458 --> 02:00:27.458
And a body without a soul
On the other side

1697
02:00:31.625 --> 02:00:38.625
Who will console the eyes that

1698
02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:46.958
Welled up

1699
02:00:47.041 --> 02:00:51.750
Because of this chaos?

1700
02:01:03.250 --> 02:01:05.166
Bhuvanamma.

1701
02:01:05.583 --> 02:01:07.625
-Bhuvanamma.
-What happened?

1702
02:01:07.708 --> 02:01:11.791
We got a call from the hospital that
the children were unwell.

1703
02:01:12.125 --> 02:01:14.125
I and Rajaram went there.

1704
02:01:14.333 --> 02:01:16.333
When we reached the hospital.
we saw the children were well.

1705
02:01:16.416 --> 02:01:19.375
but they were being shifted
from that hospital.

1706
02:01:19.583 --> 02:01:23.750
We both tried to stop them
but we couldn't.

1707
02:01:24.166 --> 02:01:28.000
They took Rajaram along with the children.

1708
02:01:28.375 --> 02:01:32.083
I think it is GK's work.

1709
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.375
So many missed calls?

1710
02:01:57.208 --> 02:01:58.458
-Vicky!
-Sister-in-law?

1711
02:01:58.875 --> 02:01:59.833
Today.

1712
02:02:00.416 --> 02:02:02.416
there is a case hearing in the court
against your brother.

1713
02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Final hearing.

1714
02:02:06.208 --> 02:02:07.041
I need your help.

1715
02:02:24.166 --> 02:02:25.000
Sister-in law.

1716
02:02:26.583 --> 02:02:27.541
Why did you bring me here?

1717
02:02:28.041 --> 02:02:29.000
What happened to brother?

1718
02:02:29.291 --> 02:02:30.875
I'll tell you that later.

1719
02:02:31.416 --> 02:02:32.416
Come in.

1720
02:02:34.291 --> 02:02:35.125
Vicky.

1721
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.750
No matter what happens inside.
don't react until I tell you.

1722
02:02:42.333 --> 02:02:43.166
Okay?

1723
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:45.833
Come.

1724
02:03:07.291 --> 02:03:08.166
Paparao.

1725
02:03:09.333 --> 02:03:10.375
Where is my husband?

1726
02:03:13.833 --> 02:03:15.291
Tell them. Commissioner.

1727
02:03:15.958 --> 02:03:18.916
He is afraid that the court
will punish him. so he ran away.

1728
02:03:19.458 --> 02:03:23.083
As soon as the arrest warrant arrives.
I will find him wherever he is.

1729
02:03:25.791 --> 02:03:27.041
Stop with your lies.

1730
02:03:28.541 --> 02:03:30.791
They called him to the hospital
saying that the children were unwell.

1731
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.166
It was GK who beat uncle
and took my husband away.

1732
02:03:36.875 --> 02:03:38.125
The police were there and didn't react.

1733
02:03:38.208 --> 02:03:40.416
that means you were
the one behind it. right?

1734
02:03:41.250 --> 02:03:44.125
Tell me. Paparao. where is he?

1735
02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:46.708
Today my son-in-law will win the case.

1736
02:03:47.625 --> 02:03:52.250
Your runaway husband will be found dead
near some railway tracks.

1737
02:03:55.375 --> 02:03:57.916
Since Rajaram has no son.

1738
02:03:58.875 --> 02:04:02.375
it is better to inform his brother to get
ready to conduct his funeral rites.

1739
02:04:13.833 --> 02:04:16.500
I don't know what you're going to do
or how you'll do it.

1740
02:04:18.333 --> 02:04:20.416
I'll be waiting for you in the court.

1741
02:04:22.541 --> 02:04:23.875
Wherever he is…

1742
02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:28.583
it is your responsibility to bring him
to the High Court by 10:30 a.m.

1743
02:04:30.958 --> 02:04:33.791
I can stand the fact
that he lost the case.

1744
02:04:34.958 --> 02:04:38.458
But I can't bear the accusation
that he ran away.

1745
02:05:18.166 --> 02:05:19.000
The judge has arrived.

1746
02:05:19.083 --> 02:05:20.333
Ma'am. the judge has arrived.

1747
02:05:20.458 --> 02:05:22.833
Mr. Rajaram is not here yet.
I am afraid that something will go wrong.

1748
02:05:23.416 --> 02:05:26.375
Don't be afraid. he'll come.

1749
02:05:29.458 --> 02:05:32.083
He will bring him in time.

1750
02:06:10.250 --> 02:06:12.416
Brother! Get up. brother.

1751
02:06:12.833 --> 02:06:13.666
Hey!

1752
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:14.583
Brother.

1753
02:06:14.666 --> 02:06:19.208
Every step you take would cost one life.

1754
02:06:19.291 --> 02:06:20.166
Come on.

1755
02:06:22.458 --> 02:06:23.291
Come on.

1756
02:06:25.125 --> 02:06:26.666
Come!

1757
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:27.625
Come on.

1758
02:06:29.291 --> 02:06:31.625
Hey. don't leave anyone. Come on.

1759
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:32.916
Kill them.

1760
02:06:33.166 --> 02:06:34.375
Kill him.

1761
02:07:07.333 --> 02:07:09.875
Hey!

1762
02:07:13.125 --> 02:07:16.000
Hello. lawyer. Are you waiting
for Rajaram?

1763
02:07:16.208 --> 02:07:17.875
Why waste your time?

1764
02:07:18.708 --> 02:07:23.750
Hello. ma'am.
The fugitives never come back.

1765
02:07:26.166 --> 02:07:29.375
Now save your brother
and the children. come.

1766
02:07:29.833 --> 02:07:32.958
How many times have you failed
my plans against your elder brother?

1767
02:07:34.875 --> 02:07:38.166
I sent people from Bihar
to your brother's house.

1768
02:07:38.250 --> 02:07:40.583
but you made them run for their lives.

1769
02:07:47.083 --> 02:07:49.791
I wanted to kill the whole family

1770
02:07:49.875 --> 02:07:52.291
while your elder brother was watching
during the yagna.

1771
02:07:52.541 --> 02:07:54.416
you came in between.

1772
02:07:56.208 --> 02:07:57.750
You don't know
where your death is coming from.

1773
02:07:57.833 --> 02:07:59.125
and I don't know how terrible it will be.

1774
02:08:00.083 --> 02:08:06.000
You challenged me
that you wouldn't let the smile disappear

1775
02:08:06.166 --> 02:08:08.291
from your family's faces.

1776
02:08:08.791 --> 02:08:11.750
and conducted the marriage that I stopped.

1777
02:08:14.250 --> 02:08:16.666
They are having the engagement
in two days.

1778
02:08:19.416 --> 02:08:23.833
Finally. I called Mukherjee
to kill Bailu Raju.

1779
02:08:24.083 --> 02:08:26.958
It's then that I found the weakest point
between you brothers.

1780
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:34.916
Save him. Now. save him.

1781
02:08:35.166 --> 02:08:39.875
You've come to save your brother. right?
Who's going to save you now?

1782
02:09:12.666 --> 02:09:13.916
Vicky. you're right.

1783
02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:17.083
It is useless to preach about goodness
to the one who comes to deceive you.

1784
02:09:17.333 --> 02:09:19.333
likewise. it is useless to speak
of righteousness to the one…

1785
02:09:19.416 --> 02:09:20.791
who comes to fight you.

1786
02:09:31.666 --> 02:09:33.625
How dare you try to kill children?

1787
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:17.083
-Proceed.
-My Lord.

1788
02:10:17.166 --> 02:10:20.708
Rajaram. who was afraid that
he would be punished has not come…

1789
02:10:20.791 --> 02:10:23.291
to the court despite knowing that
this was the final hearing of the court.

1790
02:10:23.375 --> 02:10:27.166
He is trying to leave. not just the state.
but this country.

1791
02:10:27.250 --> 02:10:28.083
-He is--
-Hello.

1792
02:10:28.166 --> 02:10:30.166
Rajaram will not come. He ran away.

1793
02:10:30.250 --> 02:10:31.541
Report this breaking news.

1794
02:10:47.666 --> 02:10:48.500
My lord.

1795
02:10:48.916 --> 02:10:52.125
The lawyer seems to have forgotten
that the court needs evidence

1796
02:10:52.208 --> 02:10:53.500
and not the allegations.

1797
02:10:53.583 --> 02:10:54.750
We have proof. my lord.

1798
02:10:57.750 --> 02:11:00.916
All the evidence is here.

1799
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:04.500
My name is Bailu Raju. sir.

1800
02:11:04.833 --> 02:11:09.166
I was the one who poured poison
into the food that went to the orphanage…

1801
02:11:10.583 --> 02:11:11.791
because I was offered money by GK. sir.

1802
02:11:12.041 --> 02:11:14.708
Mr. Rajaram doesn't know anything. sir.

1803
02:11:14.833 --> 02:11:17.458
Take this as my dying declaration. sir.

1804
02:11:29.166 --> 02:11:31.250
Your Honor. my name is Mahesh.

1805
02:11:31.833 --> 02:11:34.541
I worked as a food scientist
at GK Food Company.

1806
02:11:34.875 --> 02:11:38.041
Every single product that comes
from that processing unit is adulterated.

1807
02:11:38.125 --> 02:11:40.833
Even the coloring agents used
in those food products are adulterated.

1808
02:11:40.916 --> 02:11:44.208
I made a report on all these and
sent the samples to the lab for testing.

1809
02:11:44.291 --> 02:11:45.833
but they manipulated the results.

1810
02:11:45.916 --> 02:11:48.333
They also threaten and control the labs.

1811
02:11:48.416 --> 02:11:51.958
They also threatened
to kill me and my family.

1812
02:11:55.583 --> 02:11:56.541
My Lord.

1813
02:11:57.208 --> 02:11:59.541
I'm not doing this to protect my property.

1814
02:11:59.625 --> 02:12:03.583
nor to increase my share value.
or to improve my brand image.

1815
02:12:05.041 --> 02:12:06.791
I am fighting this case
to fight for our health.

1816
02:12:07.125 --> 02:12:09.333
for our children. for the next generation.

1817
02:12:09.666 --> 02:12:11.208
I don't think so. Your Honor.

1818
02:12:12.333 --> 02:12:15.833
Mr. Rajaram and Mr. GK are competitors.

1819
02:12:16.458 --> 02:12:18.500
This is just about personal revenge!

1820
02:12:18.666 --> 02:12:19.791
What's personal. sir?

1821
02:12:22.625 --> 02:12:25.625
Is 100 children getting cancer
after eating GK Foods personal?

1822
02:12:25.708 --> 02:12:27.041
Or is it personal to question that?

1823
02:12:27.125 --> 02:12:30.166
Come to the dais
if you have something to say.

1824
02:12:30.583 --> 02:12:34.958
My lord. "What we eat is what we are."

1825
02:12:36.291 --> 02:12:38.833
The medicines
given to mothers to produce milk.

1826
02:12:38.916 --> 02:12:41.458
the biscuits. chocolates.
chocolate syrups.

1827
02:12:41.541 --> 02:12:43.291
the pizzas and burgers
that our children love to eat…

1828
02:12:43.375 --> 02:12:45.291
Do you know how brazenly
they've been adulterating them all?!

1829
02:12:47.833 --> 02:12:50.375
Nature-identical flavored substances.
thickeners. preservatives.

1830
02:12:50.458 --> 02:12:52.208
and emulsifiers are printed
in small letters

1831
02:12:52.291 --> 02:12:54.875
along with their respective numbers
and sold openly. sir.

1832
02:12:55.958 --> 02:12:57.458
Due to eating this packaged food.
and fast food.

1833
02:12:57.541 --> 02:13:00.250
we have chemicals running
in our body instead of blood. sir.

1834
02:13:00.458 --> 02:13:03.125
Every company that plays with
people's lives must shut down!

1835
02:13:03.291 --> 02:13:05.333
They must fear
the consequences of adulteration.

1836
02:13:05.416 --> 02:13:07.000
The government must bring in
a law to enforce it. sir!

1837
02:13:07.291 --> 02:13:10.875
Otherwise. the youth of this country
will grow old before our eyes.

1838
02:13:13.208 --> 02:13:16.458
Don't give them free education
or free medical services.

1839
02:13:16.791 --> 02:13:19.625
Just give them unadulterated food.
and they will take care of the rest.

1840
02:13:20.625 --> 02:13:23.750
My Lord. these speeches
won't help anyone.

1841
02:13:23.833 --> 02:13:24.750
-Stop it.
-Our client--

1842
02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:27.041
What are you talking about. Prabhakar?

1843
02:13:28.041 --> 02:13:29.833
He's not just talking about himself.

1844
02:13:30.125 --> 02:13:32.583
it is about all of us. about our children.
about their future.

1845
02:13:37.125 --> 02:13:39.541
You win cases every day
and take the money home.

1846
02:13:39.875 --> 02:13:42.333
but if you win this case.
it's not the money that you take home.

1847
02:13:42.625 --> 02:13:43.500
it's the diseases.

1848
02:13:44.625 --> 02:13:48.125
I wish there was one person
like Mr. Rajaram in our assembly.

1849
02:13:48.291 --> 02:13:51.666
instead of our power-hungry leaders.

1850
02:13:54.500 --> 02:13:56.791
The court finds Mr. GK guilty.

1851
02:13:56.875 --> 02:14:02.875
We direct the police to ban GK Foods
and confiscate all their products.

1852
02:14:02.958 --> 02:14:07.125
We are acquitting Rajaram.
who has been falsely accused in this case.

1853
02:14:17.250 --> 02:14:20.166
HOTEL SUKHIBHAVA

1854
02:14:30.708 --> 02:14:33.166
-Why are you serving me. brother?
-It's okay. let me serve you.

1855
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:36.583
That day. I sent you away while you were
having your food.

1856
02:14:37.083 --> 02:14:38.708
Let me make up for that pain
at least a little bit.

1857
02:14:38.791 --> 02:14:41.083
Brother-in-law. sit down. I'll do it.

1858
02:14:41.166 --> 02:14:42.458
-Okay.
-Sit down.

1859
02:14:44.833 --> 02:14:47.125
Vicky. this is for you.

1860
02:14:47.666 --> 02:14:49.083
-You must finish it all.
-Enough.

1861
02:14:51.416 --> 02:14:52.250
Sister.

1862
02:14:52.583 --> 02:14:55.333
Is your brother-in-law going to eat it all
or will you serve your brother as well?

1863
02:14:55.541 --> 02:14:58.875
Hey. he's not my brother-in-law.
he's my son.

1864
02:14:58.958 --> 02:15:00.500
Then serve him the whole thing.

1865
02:15:00.708 --> 02:15:02.708
I'll help myself.

1866
02:15:02.833 --> 02:15:04.458
Please take a little.

1867

47:42.003 --> 47:43.642
[Deadpool] Hey!
We’re all grieving!

47:43.642 --> 47:46.711
PS, do you know what
he was doing to the budget?

47:46.711 --> 47:48.405
[shushing]

47:49.076 --> 47:51.144
Alioth is hungry.

47:51.144 --> 47:52.981
[Deadpool] There’s been
some kind of mistake.

47:52.981 --> 47:54.851
Big yellow is
a back-up Anchor Being,

47:54.851 --> 47:57.920
and I’m Marvel Jesus.
MJ, if you’re nasty.

47:57.920 --> 47:58.756
This may be hard to hear,

47:58.756 --> 48:00.483
but there’s
another British villain

48:00.483 --> 48:01.957
who’s gonna destroy
my universe,

48:01.957 --> 48:02.727
and I’m gonna stop him.

48:02.727 --> 48:04.564
Oh, honey,
you don’t really strike me

48:04.564 --> 48:06.929
as the world-saving type.

48:06.929 --> 48:08.700
[thunder rumbling in distance]

48:08.700 --> 48:09.998
Did I hit a nerve?

48:09.998 --> 48:12.902
[Deadpool] I didn’t want it
to come to this.

48:12.902 --> 48:13.606
Either you help us

48:13.606 --> 48:14.871
or my friend here
is gonna sing

48:14.871 --> 48:17.170
the entire second act
of Music Man

48:17.170 --> 48:18.974
with zero warm-up.

48:18.974 --> 48:20.008
Where’d you get the chair?

48:20.008 --> 48:21.108
[Cassandra Nova]
Well, once in a while,

48:21.108 --> 48:23.506
I do get a Charles
through here.

48:23.506 --> 48:24.782
Never mine, though.

48:24.782 --> 48:27.587
No. He didn’t care to find me.

48:27.587 --> 48:30.986
[Deadpool groans] Gen Z
and their trauma-bragging!

48:30.986 --> 48:34.561
Can’t you just stuff it down,
turn it into accomplishment

48:34.561 --> 48:36.156
or cancer like the rest of us?

48:36.156 --> 48:38.092
But I’m not like
the rest of you.

48:38.092 --> 48:39.698
Except maybe the Wolverine.

48:39.698 --> 48:42.833
Now, we could be
truly terrifying together.

48:42.833 --> 48:43.999
You’re that scary, huh?

48:43.999 --> 48:46.067
The TVA certainly thought so.

48:46.067 --> 48:48.806
They sent me here
before I could walk.

48:48.806 --> 48:50.577
And you know,
it’s the best thing

48:50.577 --> 48:52.612
that ever happened to me.

48:52.612 --> 48:53.206
I love it here.

48:53.206 --> 48:54.372
[Deadpool] You live
in a garbage dump.

48:54.372 --> 48:58.145
I think we both know who lives
in the garbage dump.

48:58.145 --> 48:59.619
The Void is a paradise.

48:59.619 --> 49:03.722
I can wield my power here
without shame.

49:03.722 --> 49:06.153
Unfortunately I had
no Charles Xavier

49:06.153 --> 49:08.155
to teach me temperance.

49:08.155 --> 49:10.157
What about your Charles?

49:10.157 --> 49:11.994
Did he protect you?

49:11.994 --> 49:13.996
Did he make you feel safe?

49:13.996 --> 49:15.965
We’re mutants.
We’re never safe.

49:25.073 --> 49:26.877
I don’t...
I don’t want the smoke.

49:26.877 --> 49:28.043
I don’t have
any beef with you.

49:28.043 --> 49:29.880
I just want
to save my friends.

49:29.880 --> 49:30.815
I just... I want to go home.

49:30.815 --> 49:32.982
Well, the thing is,
I could get you home.

49:32.982 --> 49:34.687
- Good.
- But I don’t want to.

49:34.687 --> 49:37.921
[Deadpool] Not good.

49:39.483 --> 49:41.584
What do you want, Wade Wilson?

49:41.584 --> 49:44.730
[Deadpool straining] Your...
fingers are inside me,

49:44.730 --> 49:45.489
but not in a good way.

49:45.489 --> 49:48.833
My brother could enter
one’s mind with a thought.

49:48.833 --> 49:51.000
I have to get my hands dirty.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.300

50:01.406 --> 50:03.683
[Wade, muffled]
What do you mean?

50:04.079 --> 50:07.654
I can’t... I can’t reach you.
You’re not here.

50:07.654 --> 50:08.688
I’m right here.

50:08.688 --> 50:11.856
- No, you’re not. I can’t...
- I’m right here.

50:11.856 --> 50:15.090
Then show me.
You got to do something.

50:15.761 --> 50:16.520
Show you what?

50:16.520 --> 50:20.326
Show me you care about
something bigger than you.

50:20.326 --> 50:25.562
Ever since they turned you
down, you took a knee.

50:25.562 --> 50:28.334
Baby, you never got back up.

50:29.467 --> 50:31.568
I know you’re
going through something.

50:31.568 --> 50:33.845
Let me go through it with you.

- Your crazy matches my crazy.

50:49.894 --> 50:51.830
"I don’t want to be with you."

Go ahead. Say it.
Say... Say, "I don’t..."

50:53.590 --> 50:54.932
Say it.
You don’t wanna be with me.

50:54.932 --> 50:56.769
Tell me that
and I’ll walk away.

yellow would be useful too.

[Deadpool] Thor!

1:06:08.108 --> 1:06:08.878
Where are we?

1:06:08.878 --> 1:06:11.947
No clue, but...
I like it here.

1:06:11.947 --> 1:06:15.885
- [door opens]
- [♪ cryptic music intensifies]

1:06:18.118 --> 1:06:19.548
[grunting]

1:06:19.548 --> 1:06:21.924

whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:07:10.907 --> 1:07:12.106
Okay.

1:07:12.106 --> 1:07:16.308
Look at you... all.
You must be the others.

1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:17.210
Terrific.

1:07:17.210 --> 1:07:20.510
So just to refresh, you are

1:07:20.510 --> 1:07:21.379
- Wonder--
- Elektra.

1:07:21.379 --> 1:07:23.645
[Deadpool] Elektra?
Yes. Who could forget?

1:07:23.645 --> 1:07:27.121
And you. I was not expecting
to see you here.

1:07:27.121 --> 1:07:29.024
I thought you were, you know,

1:07:29.024 --> 1:07:31.224
retired. [chuckles]

1:07:31.422 --> 1:07:32.929
Retarded?

1:07:33.622 --> 1:07:34.700
[Deadpool] "Retired."

1:07:34.700 --> 1:07:35.426
I’m already in The Void.

1:07:35.426 --> 1:07:36.559
I’m not trying
to get canceled again.

1:07:36.559 --> 1:07:39.705
- I don’t like you.
- [Deadpool] You never did.

1:07:40.068 --> 1:07:42.906
And who’s this
succulent reminder

1:07:42.906 --> 1:07:44.633
of my own inadequacies?

1:07:44.633 --> 1:07:45.502
Look at you.

1:07:45.502 --> 1:07:48.406
You look like the
superhero version of Hawkeye.

1:07:48.406 --> 1:07:51.948
The name’s Remy LeBeau,
Le Diable Blanc.

1:07:51.948 --> 1:07:53.015
But you can call me
the Gambit.

1:07:53.015 --> 1:07:55.644
[Deadpool] It’s been a while
since I’ve seen Sling Blade.

1:07:55.644 --> 1:07:57.217
Hit me again.

1:07:57.217 --> 1:07:58.020
They call me the Gambit.

1:07:58.020 --> 1:07:59.483
[Deadpool] Do they?
Are you sure you didn’t

1:07:59.483 --> 1:08:00.891
just really,
really want them to,

1:08:00.891 --> 1:08:03.091
but it never quite worked out?

1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:04.620
[speaks indistinctly]

1:08:04.620 --> 1:08:08.096
You know, we never had
a Wolverine up in here.

1:08:08.096 --> 1:08:08.866
But I can tell you now,

1:08:08.866 --> 1:08:10.769
it’s just a common courtesy
to ask

1:08:10.769 --> 1:08:12.496
before you drink up
all of my liquor.

1:08:12.496 --> 1:08:15.070
Well, it’s a good thing
I don’t give a fuck.

1:08:15.070 --> 1:08:18.139
[laughs, speaks indistinctly]

1:08:18.777 --> 1:08:20.207
Fuck.

1:08:21.439 --> 1:08:24.310
- [bottle smashes]
- [Deadpool] So embarrassing.

1:08:24.816 --> 1:08:25.476
Boo, boo, boo.

1:08:25.476 --> 1:08:26.543
Well, now that
that’s settled, look,

1:08:26.543 --> 1:08:27.786
we came a long way
to find you three.

1:08:27.786 --> 1:08:30.052
- There’s four of us.
- [Deadpool] There’s four...

1:08:30.052 --> 1:08:31.680
Hey, wait. Is it Magneto?

1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:33.990
Dear sweet God in heaven,
let it be Magneto,

1:08:33.990 --> 1:08:35.057
- because with him--
- He’s dead.

1:08:35.057 --> 1:08:36.927
[Deadpool] Fuck!
Now Disney gets cheap?

1:08:36.927 --> 1:08:39.028
It’s like Pinocchio jammed
his face in my ass

1:08:39.028 --> 1:08:41.030
- and started lying like crazy.
- Ooh, you nasty!

1:08:41.030 --> 1:08:43.659
Mon petit rouge. Laissez
les bons temps rouler, huh?

1:08:43.659 --> 1:08:46.695
[Deadpool] Not a single word.
What do you do exactly?

1:08:46.695 --> 1:08:49.203
Charge the playing cards
and make ’em go boom!

1:08:49.203 --> 1:08:51.843
[Deadpool] Your power’s
close-up magic. That’s good.

1:08:51.843 --> 1:08:53.779
We’re not totally
fucked at all.

1:08:53.779 --> 1:08:55.077
So who brought us here?

1:08:55.077 --> 1:08:57.112
[Voice] That would be me.

1:08:58.641 --> 1:09:01.952
[♪ pensive music playing]

1:09:06.715 --> 1:09:08.651
Don’t make me regret it.

1:09:08.992 --> 1:09:12.798
[Deadpool] Holy shit. Logan.
That’s her. That’s X-23.

1:09:12.798 --> 1:09:15.361
She’s the one
I told you about.

1:09:18.628 --> 1:09:21.169
Hey, how did you all get stuck
in The Void?

1:09:21.169 --> 1:09:22.698
There was a knock at the door.

1:09:22.698 --> 1:09:24.909
- TVA sent me here.
- Me, too.

1:09:24.909 --> 1:09:25.767
Well, maybe I was born here.

1:09:25.767 --> 1:09:27.109
It’s... It’s hard
to know for sure.

1:09:27.109 --> 1:09:30.475
TVA decided
our universe was dying.

1:09:30.475 --> 1:09:33.819
And I never even got a chance
to fight for it.

1:09:35.381 --> 1:09:37.680
[Elektra] People like us
don’t go quietly.

1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:39.858
TVA knows that,
so they took us out.

1:09:39.858 --> 1:09:42.388
[smooches]
The answer is yes. I’m in.

1:09:42.388 --> 1:09:44.159
- In what?
- [Deadpool] A team.

1:09:44.159 --> 1:09:46.491
Me, you, you, and me.
All of us together.

1:09:46.491 --> 1:09:47.789
Let’s get the fuck
out of this place.

1:09:47.789 --> 1:09:49.758
Don’t listen to him.
He’s a fucking liar!

1:09:49.758 --> 1:09:51.727
[Deadpool]
It was an educated wish!

1:09:51.727 --> 1:09:54.169
- Ha!
- [Deadpool] Look.

1:09:54.532 --> 1:09:56.468
We’ve been inside
Cassandra’s lair.

1:09:56.468 --> 1:09:59.075
The only way out of The Void
is through her.

1:09:59.075 --> 1:10:01.044
She can get us home.
She told us.

1:10:01.044 --> 1:10:03.475
Wait a minute,
you’ve been inside?

1:10:03.475 --> 1:10:05.114
- And you made it out alive?
- Bullshit.

1:10:05.114 --> 1:10:07.017
- Nobody’s ever done that.
- [Deadpool] We did.

1:10:07.017 --> 1:10:10.581
Every time one of us
has gone up against her,

1:10:10.581 --> 1:10:11.153
they die.

1:10:11.153 --> 1:10:13.859
The Punisher, the Quicksilver,
the Daredevil.

1:10:13.859 --> 1:10:15.652
[Deadpool] Daredevil?
I’m so sorry.

1:10:15.652 --> 1:10:18.028
- It’s fine.
- [Deadpool] Okay.

1:10:18.820 --> 1:10:22.527
Even that sweet, baby angel,
Johnny Storm.

1:10:22.527 --> 1:10:24.133
He up and gone missing like,

1:10:24.133 --> 1:10:25.937
what, two days ago?

1:10:25.937 --> 1:10:27.796
[Deadpool] Ugh. That’s so sad.

1:10:27.796 --> 1:10:31.206
Wherever this Johnny fella is,
I’m sure he’s thriving.

1:10:31.206 --> 1:10:31.943
[Wolverine chuckles]

1:10:31.943 --> 1:10:34.770
Look, there’s...
there’s strength in numbers.

1:10:34.770 --> 1:10:35.441
All right? Us...

1:10:35.441 --> 1:10:36.508
plus, you guys.
We can put Cassandra

1:10:36.508 --> 1:10:38.983
over our knee and force her
to let us out of The Void.

1:10:38.983 --> 1:10:40.743
I know what it means
to feel self-doubt.

1:10:40.743 --> 1:10:41.986
- I don’t feel that at all.
- I’m good.

1:10:41.986 --> 1:10:44.384
[Deadpool] Gnawing at your gut
like a coked-up tapeworm.

1:10:44.384 --> 1:10:46.056
It’s like you’re holding up
a mirror to my soul.

1:10:46.056 --> 1:10:47.926
[Deadpool] You guys
may not have been able

1:10:47.926 --> 1:10:49.686
to save your universes.

1:10:49.686 --> 1:10:51.589
But you can avenge them.

1:10:51.589 --> 1:10:53.195
It’s what Johnny
would have wanted.

1:10:53.195 --> 1:10:56.902
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1:10:57.034 --> 1:10:57.969
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

1:10:57.969 --> 1:10:59.597
Dickhead here talked him
into a team-up,

1:10:59.597 --> 1:11:02.435
and Johnny came down with
a little case of the deads.

1:11:02.435 --> 1:11:03.667
[Deadpool] No, no, no.
We don’t know that.

1:11:03.667 --> 1:11:06.043
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1:11:06.043 --> 1:11:08.837
If he survived that,
he is prayin’ for death.

1:11:08.837 --> 1:11:10.509
[Deadpool] Thank you,
Doctor Wolverine!

1:11:10.509 --> 1:11:12.918
- Spill it!
- What’d you do to Johnny, huh?

1:11:12.918 --> 1:11:13.985
Talk or I’m gonna
start dealin’.

1:11:13.985 --> 1:11:16.713
[Deadpool] Okay. Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.

1:11:16.713 --> 1:11:17.285
Look.

1:11:17.285 --> 1:11:19.683
He ran his fat-ass mouth
about Cassandra.

1:11:19.683 --> 1:11:21.058
Then she zip-zapped his skin,

1:11:21.058 --> 1:11:23.027
leaving his organs to splash
crudely onto the ground

1:11:23.027 --> 1:11:26.657
while the soil
greedily drank his blood.
It was horrible.

1:11:26.657 --> 1:11:27.790
He was like a brother to me.

1:11:27.790 --> 1:11:31.332
Look, he died before he could
make a difference. But...

1:11:31.332 --> 1:11:32.795
- [laughs]
- Look, maybe you couldn’t

1:11:32.795 --> 1:11:33.939
save your worlds, but...

1:11:33.939 --> 1:11:36.535
but Jesus Christ,
you can save mine!

1:11:36.535 --> 1:11:38.801
I don’t give a shit
about your world, but

1:11:38.801 --> 1:11:42.112
if these two made it out of
there alive, maybe together,

1:11:42.112 --> 1:11:43.806
we can get back in
and take her down.

1:11:43.806 --> 1:11:46.875
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, Chere.

1:11:46.875 --> 1:11:49.152
[Deadpool] If we can block
her psychic powers,

1:11:49.152 --> 1:11:51.220
we can get a leg up.
I know it.

1:11:51.220 --> 1:11:52.958
Now, I know Magneto’s dead.

1:11:52.958 --> 1:11:55.356
But I’d venture to guess
that his helmet is lying

1:11:55.356 --> 1:11:57.655
- around here somewhere--
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1:11:57.655 --> 1:11:58.964
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1:11:58.964 --> 1:12:00.823
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- She don’t play.

1:12:00.823 --> 1:12:02.396
She knows that helmet
was the only way

1:12:02.396 --> 1:12:03.859
to protect anyone
from her powers.

1:12:03.859 --> 1:12:06.202
The only other helmet that
strong is Juggernaut’s,

1:12:06.202 --> 1:12:07.071
but he works for Cassandra.

1:12:07.071 --> 1:12:08.435
[Deadpool]
Juggernaut’s helmet.
That’s it.

1:12:08.435 --> 1:12:10.371
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain’t comin’ off

1:12:10.371 --> 1:12:11.977
without that dome
gonna come off wit’it.

1:12:11.977 --> 1:12:13.473
[Deadpool] I’m so sorry, beautiful.

1:12:13.473 --> 1:12:14.309
I want this to be gentle.

1:12:14.309 --> 1:12:16.179
Who is your dialect coach?
The Minions?

1:12:16.179 --> 1:12:20.711
I feel like we are missing
critical exposition here.

1:12:20.711 --> 1:12:24.814
I’m sick of this shit.
I’m sick of hiding.

1:12:24.814 --> 1:12:27.223
Let’s face it,
our worlds forgot about us.

1:12:27.223 --> 1:12:29.159
Or never learned about us.

1:12:29.159 --> 1:12:30.754
The heroes we were.

1:12:30.754 --> 1:12:31.997
Lives we saved.

1:12:31.997 --> 1:12:33.163
Or wanted to save.

1:12:33.163 --> 1:12:35.561
Maybe these two
are our chance.

1:12:35.561 --> 1:12:36.760
[gurgling]

1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:38.498
To be remembered.

1:12:38.498 --> 1:12:40.236
The way we deserve.

1:12:40.830 --> 1:12:41.963
[Deadpool] Yes.

1:12:41.963 --> 1:12:43.569
An ending.

1:12:43.569 --> 1:12:44.867
- Legacy.
- [Deadpool] Yes!

1:12:44.867 --> 1:12:46.077
Yes! Let this man cook.

1:12:46.077 --> 1:12:47.606
This is what
I’m talking about.

1:12:47.606 --> 1:12:49.773
Big slow-motion fights,
sad music.

1:12:49.773 --> 1:12:50.642
Everybody working together.

1:12:50.642 --> 1:12:52.677
Who knows if you live or die?
That sorta thing.

1:12:52.677 --> 1:12:55.119
- Who’s ready?
- I was born ready.

1:12:55.119 --> 1:12:56.450
[Deadpool] Yes!
Gambit?

1:12:56.450 --> 1:12:57.220
I ain’t know my daddy,

1:12:57.220 --> 1:12:59.123
but I’m sure I shot out
of his dick ready.

1:12:59.123 --> 1:13:00.751
[Deadpool] Jesus Christ,
that is graphic.

1:13:00.751 --> 1:13:02.720
Yeah. He was layin’ them
buttery nuts all up in my mama

1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:04.821
and I shot out there
and I said, "What’s up, Doc?"

1:13:04.821 --> 1:13:07.725
[Deadpool laughs]
Johnny must have loved you.

1:13:07.725 --> 1:13:10.167
X-23, what’s it gonna be?

1:13:10.167 --> 1:13:10.860
The name’s Laura.

1:13:10.860 --> 1:13:14.072
- Let’s fucking go.
- [Deadpool] Let’s fucking go!

1:13:14.072 --> 1:13:15.172
It’s on like chicken and corn.

1:13:15.172 --> 1:13:17.042
- [Deadpool] Yeah!
- We’re doing this.

1:13:17.042 --> 1:13:17.801
You’re all fuckin’ dead.

1:13:17.801 --> 1:13:21.145
[Deadpool] My God!
Read the room.

1:13:23.873 --> 1:13:26.282
[crickets chirping]

1:13:29.747 --> 1:13:30.583
[exhales]

1:13:30.583 --> 1:13:35.126
Hey, hey. I’m not lookin’
for company. Get out of here.

1:13:36.589 --> 1:13:38.129
You remind me of him.

1:13:38.129 --> 1:13:39.493
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1:13:39.493 --> 1:13:42.826
- Sounds like a great guy--
- Wasn’t finished.

1:13:43.629 --> 1:13:46.236
Showed up when
it mattered the most.

1:13:47.831 --> 1:13:50.141
Couldn’t help it.

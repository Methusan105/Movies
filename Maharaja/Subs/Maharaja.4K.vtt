00:00.958 --> 00:03.208
Smoking causes cancer. Smoking kills.

00:03.291 --> 00:05.625
Consumption of alcohol
is injurious to health.

00:05.708 --> 00:07.250
Be safe. Don't drink and drive.

00:07.333 --> 00:10.208
Drug usage is injurious to health
and is a criminal offense.

01:49.291 --> 01:53.250
The paintings you drew
Are etched in my heart

01:53.333 --> 01:57.041
Even the rain cannot wash them away

01:57.416 --> 02:01.458
A day filled with laughter
And joy with you

02:01.541 --> 02:05.250
There is no happiness
That can surpass that, oh dear!

02:05.625 --> 02:09.666
Even the mirror looks at you

02:09.750 --> 02:13.500
To see its beauty

02:13.625 --> 02:17.208
The breeze will sing to you what I can't

02:17.333 --> 02:21.458
Your words bring life to me

02:21.625 --> 02:25.416
The amethyst flower and our native music

02:25.500 --> 02:29.333
Fill me with happiness when I sing

02:29.541 --> 02:33.291
To my dear love, my girl…

02:33.375 --> 02:34.500
Girl! Sing a song with "girl" in it.

02:34.833 --> 02:37.458
Hey there, my chubby girl

02:37.541 --> 02:40.250
Can't you see my eyes
Are calling out to you?

02:40.541 --> 02:45.333
Did my mustache prick you
Oh, diamond rose?

02:45.458 --> 02:50.166
Does she lovingly call you Tom?

02:50.250 --> 02:51.083
-Tom!
-Tom!

02:51.708 --> 02:55.916
Now, Maharaja will sing a song
with the word "Tom" in it.

02:56.458 --> 02:58.166
Go ahead, sing. "Tom."

03:02.375 --> 03:03.208
Tom…

03:04.500 --> 03:06.083
-Yes, Tom.
-Tom…

03:06.166 --> 03:07.000
Yes. The word is "Tom."

03:07.541 --> 03:08.375
-Tom.
-Tom.

03:08.458 --> 03:09.583
-Tom?
-Yes.

03:10.208 --> 03:11.750
-Tom…
-Yes.

03:13.958 --> 03:15.500
-Tomorrow, I want a day off.
-What?

03:15.750 --> 03:18.041
-Tomorrow, I want a day off.
-You want a day off?

03:18.125 --> 03:20.166
-Yes.
-There is no such song.

03:21.208 --> 03:22.458
Have you heard any such song?

03:22.541 --> 03:24.875
Of course, but it goes,
"I want a day off today."

03:24.958 --> 03:26.416
I need a day off today

03:26.500 --> 03:29.458
-I need a--
-Hey, I'll break your jaws!

03:30.083 --> 03:32.000
Is this how you talk to your boss?

03:32.250 --> 03:35.000
-Are you both mocking me?
-I wasn't mocking.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.000
My wife wanted
to go shopping for our baby.

03:38.291 --> 03:39.708
-Hence…
-No, I don't get it.

03:40.333 --> 03:41.416
I really don't get it.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.958
You talk as if
you're the only one with a family.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.958
Do you think we don't have families too?

03:46.166 --> 03:47.958
You always run off
to fulfill your wife and kid's needs.

03:48.125 --> 03:50.708
If everyone took time off,
who would attend to our customers?

03:50.791 --> 03:52.375
Customers? Yeah, right!

03:52.583 --> 03:55.541
You talk as if there's a queue
24 hours a day to get haircuts.

03:55.625 --> 03:59.041
To attract customers,
we need to sport a smiling face.

03:59.666 --> 04:01.916
If you keep a face like an old,
smothered brush,

04:02.000 --> 04:03.291
not even a dog will come to our shop.

04:03.791 --> 04:04.666
Excuse me.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.166
Excuse me, it was just a figure of speech.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.875
We don't cut hair for dogs.

04:13.958 --> 04:16.833
Sir, I'm not here for him but for myself.

04:17.583 --> 04:19.500
I take Max to a pet spa for grooming.

04:19.583 --> 04:20.625
For you?

04:20.708 --> 04:22.041
Maharaja will attend to you.
Please come in.

04:22.916 --> 04:24.791
What are you looking at?
You wanted a day off, right?

04:24.916 --> 04:27.250
Well, you will attend to all the customers
that come in today.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.791
Sir, please take a seat. Come.

05:12.958 --> 05:14.958
-Got rejected at home?
-Yes.

05:15.041 --> 05:16.333
Fine, find another one.

05:45.750 --> 05:46.916
-She said okay to this.
-Give it.

05:55.625 --> 05:57.250
-Bill this one as well.
-Listen,

05:57.750 --> 06:00.333
get approval for this one as well.
What if she rejects it?

06:08.166 --> 06:09.250
She will love it.

07:11.916 --> 07:12.916
I am Jothi.

07:13.625 --> 07:14.541
I'm studying in the tenth grade.

07:16.208 --> 07:18.750
To be honest,
I'm a bit weak in my studies.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.708
But I am very much interested in sports.

07:25.666 --> 07:27.708
I spend more time on the field
than in the classroom.

07:29.166 --> 07:31.083
And that's why none
of the teachers like me.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.000
Waste!

07:33.000 --> 07:33.916
Except one.

07:35.666 --> 07:37.291
Ms. Asifa, our P.E. teacher.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.083
-Oh, sorry. Ma'am…
-Please come, ma'am.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.125
After all, it's P.E. period, right?

07:40.208 --> 07:42.041
I have to finish the syllabus.
Let me have it.

07:42.125 --> 07:44.250
What do you mean by
"After all, it's P.E. period"?

07:45.333 --> 07:47.166
"Sound body, sound soul."
Haven't you heard?

07:48.375 --> 07:51.250
She's very straightforward
and very friendly.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.333
I'm her favorite.

07:55.291 --> 07:57.833
She helps me with other subjects as well.

08:06.375 --> 08:09.583
Right now, she's training me
for the 100-meter zonal competition.

08:13.958 --> 08:15.458
And our house?

08:16.875 --> 08:18.166
Here, this is our house.

08:21.875 --> 08:23.708
This is my father, Maharaja.

08:25.333 --> 08:26.708
We are a family of three.

08:27.625 --> 08:30.208
Myself, Dad, and Lakshmi.

08:30.416 --> 08:32.541
Who's Lakshmi? Your mom?

08:32.625 --> 08:34.375
My mother passed away when I was a baby.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.833
Oh, sorry! So, who's Lakshmi?

08:44.208 --> 08:46.666
A dustbin named Lakshmi?

08:46.750 --> 08:48.708
So, you guys named a dustbin?

08:48.791 --> 08:51.291
When I was a baby, the house
I was in was destroyed in an accident.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.875
Lakshmi fell upon me,
covered me, and saved my life.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.916
Since then,
Lakshmi has been a part of our family.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.750
Every Friday, Dad and I bathe Lakshmi,

08:59.833 --> 09:01.666
apply holy ash and vermilion to it,
and pray together.

09:09.708 --> 09:10.875
Dear, it's getting late.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.750
You should have woken me up early!

09:12.958 --> 09:14.833
She keeps snoozing when I wake her up

09:14.916 --> 09:16.375
and then blames me for being late!

09:18.583 --> 09:19.416
What have you prepared?

09:19.958 --> 09:21.041
Lemon rice and egg.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.666
Every day!

09:39.125 --> 09:43.916
O, my daughter, you are my world

09:44.458 --> 09:49.083
You are like the pointing finger
That shows me the right direction

09:49.583 --> 09:51.666
Even your cry is a melody to my ears

09:52.166 --> 09:54.291
Even if you hurt me
I will still love you with all my heart

09:54.791 --> 09:58.375
A daughter is every father's world

09:58.458 --> 09:59.458
This grandpa is Mr. Gopal.

09:59.875 --> 10:03.125
So, tell me something.
Who named you Maharaja?

10:03.791 --> 10:06.125
The apt name for you
is Mr. "Long Face" King.

10:06.333 --> 10:09.375
A smile on your face makes you look good.

10:10.083 --> 10:14.541
Instead, if you keep a long face,
no dog will ever step into our shop!

10:18.583 --> 10:21.625
Well, thanks to kind-hearted people
like him, our shop keeps running.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.791
Please turn your head.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.208
Don't give the money to me.
Pay it to the owner.

10:27.666 --> 10:30.750
He is the owner, and I am the laborer
for this "good for nothing" shop.

10:32.083 --> 10:34.375
See, my father works under him
despite being the owner of the shop.

10:35.375 --> 10:36.375
This is doctor uncle,

10:36.958 --> 10:38.041
a friend of my dad's.

10:38.458 --> 10:39.958
Why did you come all the way here?

10:40.083 --> 10:41.333
I could have come to your shop.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.041
It would have been
a good walking exercise for me.

10:44.291 --> 10:45.500
I am talking to you!

10:50.958 --> 10:53.875
Once a month, he takes a day off,
and we roam around.

10:54.166 --> 10:57.041
Not to exotic destinations
but to the shopping street and the beach.

11:01.083 --> 11:04.500
You switch the spoon of salt with sugar
and the spoon of sugar with chili powder!

11:04.583 --> 11:07.041
I've told you a thousand times
to scrub the cloth before washing.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.458
It's still dirty!

11:08.708 --> 11:11.958
Haven't I told you to bathe before
entering the kitchen after salon work?

11:12.291 --> 11:13.833
Look at all these hairs.

11:18.458 --> 11:22.208
His shop and our home,
that's my dad's world.

11:22.291 --> 11:26.458
Mom came as my daughter

11:26.833 --> 11:30.458
Came to take care
Of the father's mental health

11:30.541 --> 11:32.458
My dad never gives up on me,
no matter what.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.541
Let me explain what happened one day.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.666
Here's your daughter's transfer
certificate and sports certificate.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.083
Take them and leave!

11:39.291 --> 11:41.958
Sir, let me speak.

11:42.041 --> 11:43.916
-To hell with your "Sir"!
-Sir--

11:44.000 --> 11:46.958
Your daughter mixed alcohol
in the chief guest's welcome drink!

11:47.041 --> 11:47.958
He was an IAS officer!

11:48.041 --> 11:51.083
I had my school
ranked among the top ten! Top ten!

11:51.458 --> 11:52.333
It's all gone now!

11:52.666 --> 11:55.708
-She wouldn't have done it, sir.
-Come again! She wouldn't have done it?

11:55.833 --> 11:58.125
The alcohol bottle was found
in your daughter's bag!

11:58.333 --> 12:00.625
Are the witnesses lying,
or do you think I'm lying?

12:00.958 --> 12:03.416
I don't care about that, sir.
My daughter wouldn't have done it.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.083
Your daughter, my foot!

12:05.166 --> 12:08.250
You and your daughter better leave!
Or else, just one phone call,

12:08.458 --> 12:11.083
and you will be in prison! Shall I?

12:11.750 --> 12:12.583
Now, watch me!

12:13.958 --> 12:14.833
Sir!

12:20.125 --> 12:23.708
Now, you're going to tell me he did it,
and she's innocent. Am I right?

12:24.041 --> 12:27.041
All I'm saying is, please investigate
such sensitive issues thoroughly.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.708
Don't any of you have any sense?

12:37.791 --> 12:39.958
Is this how you accuse someone
without conducting a proper inquiry?

12:40.041 --> 12:42.583
I was embarrassed in front
of the IAS officer then,

12:42.666 --> 12:44.416
and now I'm embarrassed
by all of you again in front of him!

12:45.541 --> 12:46.791
You! Come here!

12:48.375 --> 12:49.250
I said, come here!

12:52.166 --> 12:53.166
Sir, what are you doing?

12:53.416 --> 12:56.583
Principal, his father
must be here tomorrow. Got it?

12:59.250 --> 13:00.833
Don't think you got away.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.416
If I catch you doing something wrong,
I'll throw you out of here!

13:03.708 --> 13:05.541
There won't be any hearings like this.

13:05.625 --> 13:06.458
Got it?

13:06.541 --> 13:08.958
You all may leave.
Hey! I said, leave!

13:09.041 --> 13:09.875
I said, out!

13:10.666 --> 13:13.125
You! Do you need special instruction?

13:13.250 --> 13:14.166
-Get lost.
-Jothi.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.875
Didn't I tell you
she wouldn't have done it, sir?

13:18.791 --> 13:20.875
-You rushed to judgment and scolded her.
-So what?

13:21.458 --> 13:22.666
Apologize to my daughter, sir.

13:23.916 --> 13:25.000
-Come again.
-Sir…

13:25.833 --> 13:27.166
My daughter is innocent. Right, sir?

13:27.375 --> 13:28.875
-Dad, let's go.
-Yet you scolded her.

13:29.291 --> 13:30.208
Wasn't that wrong?

13:30.708 --> 13:31.541
Apologize to my daughter, sir.

13:31.625 --> 13:32.791
-Dad, let's go.
-Hey!

13:33.000 --> 13:34.541
Do you know whom you're talking to?

13:34.625 --> 13:36.333
-I own many schools and colleges!
-Dad, let's go.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.708
-Let him apologize.
-You want me to apologize?

13:38.791 --> 13:40.083
That too to your daughter?

13:40.166 --> 13:41.958
-Even if I--
-I don't care about that.

13:42.666 --> 13:45.791
Wasn't it wrong of you to scold her?
She'd be hurt, right?

13:46.208 --> 13:48.125
-Apologize to her, and I'll leave, sir.
-Hey!

13:48.375 --> 13:50.291
-Out! Get out!
-Dad, let's go.

13:50.375 --> 13:52.125
-Wait, we'll go.
-Security! Come here!

13:52.541 --> 13:54.541
-Throw him out!
-Apologize to my daughter, sir.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.166
-Drag him away and throw him out!
-Sir, it was wrong of you to scold her.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.833
-Apologize.
-Drag him away!

13:58.916 --> 14:00.208
-Dad, let's go. Please.
-Sir, apologize…

14:00.291 --> 14:01.833
-Dad, please! Let's go.
-Sir…

14:01.916 --> 14:04.958
-Apologize to her, sir. She is innocent.
-Dad, please. Let's leave.

14:05.041 --> 14:06.708
-Throw him out!
-Sir, apologize!

14:06.791 --> 14:09.708
Teacher, my daughter's innocent.
Ask him to apologize.

14:09.791 --> 14:11.458
-Dad, please. Let's leave.
-Stop listening to him!

14:11.541 --> 14:13.458
-Throw him out!
-Sir, apologize to her.

14:13.541 --> 14:15.500
Sir, you're being unfair.
Ask them to leave him.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.291
-I don't want him here! Throw him out!
-Sir…

14:17.583 --> 14:18.958
Sir, you were wrong to scold her.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.166
-Sir, you were wrong to scold her.
-Get out of here, you rascal!

14:21.250 --> 14:22.125
-Sir…
-You better leave!

14:22.208 --> 14:24.833
-Apologize to her!
-Sir, please listen to me.

14:24.916 --> 14:26.708
-Apologize to her!
-Dad…

14:26.791 --> 14:29.375
-Sir, let go of him. Please.
-Apologize to her!

14:29.458 --> 14:30.708
-Apologize to her!
-Jothi…

14:30.791 --> 14:32.875
-Throw him out! Now!
-Sir…

14:32.958 --> 14:34.166
-Don't spare him!
-Sir…

14:35.291 --> 14:39.000
Sir, he won't let go of that grip
until you apologize to me.

14:39.291 --> 14:41.375
Please apologize to me, sir.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.833
You're being so unfair!

14:42.916 --> 14:45.416
Apologize to her, sir!

14:45.791 --> 14:46.958
Please listen to me, sir.

14:47.166 --> 14:48.625
Sir, please apologize to me.

14:48.708 --> 14:49.958
-He isn't listening to us, sir.
-Apologize to my her, sir.

14:50.416 --> 14:54.083
Apologize to my daughter, sir!
Apologize to her!

14:54.541 --> 14:58.291
Sir, please apologize to my daughter!
Apologize to her!

14:58.541 --> 15:01.291
-Hey! Let go of him.
-Apologize to her.

15:01.375 --> 15:02.833
Just let go of him!

15:02.916 --> 15:04.291
I said, let go of him!

15:04.375 --> 15:06.583
-Apologize to her, sir.
-Let go of him. Leave him.

15:07.125 --> 15:08.000
Let go of him!

15:10.916 --> 15:11.750
Look, dear.

15:12.208 --> 15:13.666
I was wrong to scold you.

15:13.833 --> 15:16.541
It was an honest mistake, dear.
Forgive me.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.208
That's my dad for you.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.416
I am going out of town
to attend a sports camp.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.083
For the first time, my dad
will be away from me for a week.

15:42.041 --> 15:45.791
Since I won’t be here, don’t be careless
and leave the main door open.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.375
-Fine.
-Eat on time, Dad.

15:47.750 --> 15:48.833
Also, sleep on time.

15:49.583 --> 15:50.750
I am going to a camp,

15:51.250 --> 15:52.375
so I won’t be in school.

15:52.791 --> 15:54.208
Don’t forget that
and end up going to school.

15:55.041 --> 15:55.875
Okay?

16:00.250 --> 16:01.666
Yes, an important thing.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.250
Keep Lakshmi clean.
I’ll make video calls often and check!

16:05.500 --> 16:07.708
And I will call when I'm free.
Understood?

16:10.875 --> 16:12.583
-Good morning, Miss.
-Good morning.

16:16.708 --> 16:17.625
-Hi.
-Hi, Jothi.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.666
Dad, bye.

16:19.958 --> 16:21.500
-See you.
-Take care.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.041
Yes, sir? What happened?

18:21.416 --> 18:23.125
Have you watched the movie
Parvai Ondre Podhume?

18:23.208 --> 18:25.500
Parvai Ondre Podhume…
No, sir.

18:25.583 --> 18:29.833
The gentle breeze and a beautiful flower

18:29.916 --> 18:31.791
-They fell in love--
-I've not watched it, sir.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.750
-No? Really?
-No. I don't know.

18:33.833 --> 18:34.666
-You didn't watch it?
-No, sir.

18:37.791 --> 18:38.750
I left my car here for service,

18:38.833 --> 18:40.541
and you stole the sunglasses
that were in it?

18:40.625 --> 18:41.791
-Where are my Kunal sunglasses?
-It hurts, sir.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.750
-Where are my hero's sunglasses?
-Sir!

18:43.833 --> 18:45.875
-Where are the Kunal sunglasses?
-Sir…

18:45.958 --> 18:46.875
Where are they?

18:46.958 --> 18:47.875
-Where are they? Tell me!
-Sir, please.

18:47.958 --> 18:49.333
-Brother…
-Get lost.

18:49.416 --> 18:51.375
If you come near me,
I’ll rip you all apart!

18:51.458 --> 18:54.125
-Where are my hero’s sunglasses?
-Sir, I didn't take it. I swear.

18:54.208 --> 18:55.875
-I don't know, sir.
-Get up!

18:55.958 --> 18:57.583
-Tell me! Move!
-Sir…

18:57.666 --> 19:00.000
-Sir…
-Tell me! Today, all of you are finished!

19:00.083 --> 19:01.666
-I don't know, sir.
-Where are my hero’s sunglasses?

19:01.750 --> 19:04.708
-Tell me, or else I’ll chop you down!
-Sir, let me speak. Wait.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.125
-Tell me! Now!
-Sir…

19:07.208 --> 19:08.208
Sir…

19:08.291 --> 19:10.375
Sir, that guy is the one
who delivered your car.

19:10.541 --> 19:12.791
Sir, let me check with him. Please.

19:15.833 --> 19:17.416
Hey! Where are the Kunal sunglasses?

19:17.916 --> 19:18.791
Kunal sunglasses?

19:19.416 --> 19:20.625
Why are you asking me?

19:21.083 --> 19:24.541
You're the one who serviced his car
and delivered it last evening.

19:24.750 --> 19:26.250
If not you,
who else could have taken them?

19:26.333 --> 19:27.916
Are you accusing me of stealing
just because I delivered the car?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.750
-Mind your job!
-You're the thief!

19:29.833 --> 19:31.791
-You're crossing the line!
-You thief!

19:31.875 --> 19:32.958
You just got released from prison!

19:33.500 --> 19:35.000
-I showed pity on you
-These guys!

19:35.083 --> 19:36.333
and you steal from the customer?

19:36.416 --> 19:38.500
Why should I get the beatings
for your crime?

19:40.458 --> 19:44.000
You delivered the car this morning
instead of last evening!

19:44.083 --> 19:45.750
-Sir…
-My house is just three kilometers away!

19:45.833 --> 19:47.291
Did you travel the whole night
to reach my home?

19:47.750 --> 19:50.500
-Sir…
-Where are my sunglasses? Answer me!

19:51.416 --> 19:52.916
Hands off me! Today, I will…

19:53.625 --> 19:55.041
Speak! Where is it?

19:55.125 --> 19:57.666
-Answer me!
-Sir! Please, no!

19:57.750 --> 20:00.708
-Leave him. I'll buy you a new one.
-A new one?

20:00.833 --> 20:03.333
-Damn it, my hero Kunal gifted it to me!
-Sir…

20:03.416 --> 20:05.875
There's no replacement for it.
I want that back!

20:06.333 --> 20:07.833
I want those sunglasses back!

20:08.291 --> 20:11.250
Listen, if I don’t get
my sunglasses back by tomorrow,

20:11.416 --> 20:12.958
I'll burn down the whole garage.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.708
Understood? Hands off me!

20:14.875 --> 20:17.208
Get lost! I'll kill both of you.

20:17.833 --> 20:18.708
Understand?

20:30.750 --> 20:32.458
You shouldn't have let him go so easily.

20:32.541 --> 20:34.666
You should've beaten him up
even more. Frauds!

20:34.750 --> 20:36.500
-Brother, bring me a drink.
-In a similar case, a guy in Kerala

20:36.833 --> 20:38.833
bought a second-hand Benz.

20:39.666 --> 20:41.583
Only when he left his car
for service did he find out

20:41.666 --> 20:43.291
it wasn't a Benz but a cheap car.

20:44.666 --> 20:47.666
See how they trick people,
just like in the movies!

20:48.000 --> 20:50.041
Buddy, you shouldn't have settled for
just beating him up.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.541
You should have burned down his garage.

21:08.583 --> 21:09.500
I'll finish you off today!

21:53.083 --> 21:55.875
You roam around in my car,

21:56.750 --> 21:58.041
and on top of that, you beat me up?

21:59.291 --> 22:00.208
I won't spare you.

22:11.416 --> 22:12.291
Mr. Police.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.333
-Mr. Police.
-Sir…

22:15.625 --> 22:16.458
Come here.

22:17.083 --> 22:17.958
Sir…

22:19.125 --> 22:19.958
Sir?

22:21.041 --> 22:23.125
"Mala, how are you, Mala?"

22:24.083 --> 22:24.916
I'm good.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.708
Sir, please wrap it up quickly.

22:27.791 --> 22:29.250
I have a lot of work to do.
I have to go.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.500
Wait, turn around.

22:31.541 --> 22:33.083
-What's this?
-Master key, sir.

22:33.833 --> 22:34.916
Why are you wearing it as a necklace?

22:35.375 --> 22:36.625
So that nobody will steal it.

22:36.833 --> 22:37.916
From you?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.041
-Yeah, right!
-Sir, how do you want me to stand?

22:40.375 --> 22:41.291
However you wish.

22:48.416 --> 22:51.625
Oh, mother! Oh, my God!

22:51.875 --> 22:53.000
Oh, father!

22:55.291 --> 22:56.833
G. SURENDAR

22:57.333 --> 23:00.333
Oh, mother! Oh, father!

23:03.875 --> 23:05.375
You must not take a dump for ten days!

23:10.375 --> 23:11.416
Hey, stop!

23:12.208 --> 23:13.125
Where are you running? Stop!

23:14.208 --> 23:15.083
Hey!

23:17.708 --> 23:19.041
You'll steal mopeds?

23:20.666 --> 23:22.791
-Come here!
-Sir…

23:22.875 --> 23:24.083
-Sir…
-Is this your in-laws house?

23:24.166 --> 23:25.125
-You want to leave immediately?
-Sir…

23:25.791 --> 23:26.666
Oh, God!

23:26.750 --> 23:29.125
No! Things don't work here
as per your wish.

23:29.625 --> 23:30.833
-You thief!
-Sir!

23:30.916 --> 23:31.833
Oh, God!

23:32.625 --> 23:33.750
I'll finish you off, jerk.

23:35.875 --> 23:36.708
Hey.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.125
-Who are you?
-Sir, my name is Maharaja.

23:40.416 --> 23:43.375
There was a theft in my house.
I want to file a police report.

23:43.583 --> 23:44.541
You want to file a police report?

23:44.958 --> 23:47.416
Why don't you also start
the investigation?

23:47.916 --> 23:50.166
First, tell us what was stolen.

23:50.375 --> 23:52.208
I will decide if a police report
is needed.

23:52.583 --> 23:53.958
A police report straight away? My foot!

24:09.125 --> 24:09.958
Quenched your thirst?

24:10.333 --> 24:12.666
Your proper introduction
and tell me what exactly was stolen.

24:12.750 --> 24:13.750
Provide a clear explanation.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.000
Sir, my name is Maharaja.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.958
I run a salon in K.K. Nagar.

24:21.875 --> 24:22.708
Yes, sir.

24:23.333 --> 24:24.958
I reside at Bharathi Nagar, Pallikaranai.

24:26.458 --> 24:28.083
Last night, around ten o'clock,

24:29.166 --> 24:30.666
I returned home after closing my shop.

24:32.625 --> 24:35.666
I always keep the house key
under a flower vase outside.

24:35.750 --> 24:36.625
Okay.

24:36.916 --> 24:38.625
Yesterday, upon reaching home,
I retrieved the key,

24:39.541 --> 24:40.958
unlocked the door, and entered the house.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.375
I switched on the living room light.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.625
Then, I removed the bag
from my shoulder and placed it down.

24:47.583 --> 24:50.916
-Then I went inside the room to change.
-Okay.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.833
Suddenly, I heard a noise from behind.

24:57.208 --> 24:58.750
I turned around.

25:01.958 --> 25:02.875
There were two of them,

25:03.708 --> 25:04.750
wearing masks.

25:04.833 --> 25:05.750
What are you saying?

25:05.833 --> 25:07.791
One of them advanced toward me.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.083
I screamed, "Who are you?"

25:11.875 --> 25:14.958
He quickly covered my mouth
with his hand and restrained me.

25:15.166 --> 25:17.041
-God!
-Then I bit his hand, sir.

25:19.750 --> 25:23.166
Suddenly, a third guy…
I think he was hiding in the living room.

25:24.791 --> 25:28.041
He rushed toward me
and struck me with an iron rod.

25:28.583 --> 25:30.000
I lost my senses, sir.

25:30.583 --> 25:33.125
My vision blurred,
and everything went blank.

25:35.750 --> 25:38.750
-All three of them started hitting me.
-Wait!

25:39.458 --> 25:42.583
So they broke into your house
even before you arrived?

25:42.666 --> 25:43.500
Yes, sir.

25:44.250 --> 25:45.166
Okay.

25:45.625 --> 25:46.500
Continue.

25:47.208 --> 25:49.708
They beat me up,
stole my Lakshmi, and ran off.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.041
Please help me find my Lakshmi, sir.

25:53.916 --> 25:55.000
It'll be a bit difficult.

25:57.083 --> 25:57.916
So, how many grams?

25:58.458 --> 25:59.833
Sir, not jewels.

26:00.166 --> 26:01.666
-Then, money?
-Not money either, sir.

26:02.583 --> 26:03.958
Then Lakshmi must be…

26:04.250 --> 26:06.500
-Your wife?
-She passed away long ago.

26:07.916 --> 26:09.958
-I'm sorry.
-I live with my daughter.

26:10.333 --> 26:11.666
She's on a school camping trip.

26:12.083 --> 26:13.416
You're confusing me, man!

26:13.625 --> 26:16.166
You say it's not your daughter,
wife, or sister.

26:16.250 --> 26:17.625
Then who is Lakshmi?

26:18.208 --> 26:19.750
Sir… Lakshmi, sir…

26:22.041 --> 26:23.625
What does this mean?

26:24.541 --> 26:26.666
-Who is Lakshmi?
-Sir… Lakshmi, sir.

26:26.750 --> 26:27.750
Sir, wait. Hold on.

26:28.708 --> 26:30.500
Here, sir. Look at this.

26:33.000 --> 26:33.833
This is you.

26:34.416 --> 26:35.958
-And that's my daughter.
-I can see that.

26:36.583 --> 26:37.416
Where's Lakshmi?

26:39.708 --> 26:40.541
Lakshmi, sir.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.500
-The dustbin?
-That's Lakshmi, sir.

26:48.958 --> 26:49.791
The dustbin?

26:50.791 --> 26:51.625
That's Lakshmi?

26:52.458 --> 26:53.708
I'm much better than him.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.875
Earlier, when you said
you wanted to file a police report,

26:59.291 --> 27:01.083
it was for this missing dustbin?

27:01.541 --> 27:02.541
-Sir, that's Lakshmi.
-You!

27:02.916 --> 27:04.958
-A dustbin, right?
-Sir, Lakshmi.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.000
I'll break your jaws!

27:09.375 --> 27:10.208
Fine.

27:10.625 --> 27:13.208
Answer my questions clearly.

27:13.916 --> 27:16.791
Was there any jewelry
or money in the dustbin?

27:16.875 --> 27:17.750
No, sir.

27:18.708 --> 27:21.291
-Any important documents?
-No, sir.

27:21.375 --> 27:22.833
-There was nothing in it?
-No, sir.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.125
-Not even garbage?
-No, sir.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.041
-Not even any garbage in the dustbin?
-No, sir.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.041
Fine.

27:30.541 --> 27:32.583
Was that dustbin

27:32.708 --> 27:34.958
-made of gold?
-Lakshmi is made of iron, sir.

27:35.041 --> 27:36.250
-Iron?
-Yes, sir.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.750
-How much did it cost?
-Well…

27:39.750 --> 27:41.958
back then, it was worth
about 350 to 400 rupees, sir.

27:43.083 --> 27:46.541
And those three broke in to steal
that 350-rupee dustbin?

27:46.625 --> 27:47.458
Yes, sir.

27:47.541 --> 27:50.166
-They attacked you and took it!
-Yes, sir.

27:50.375 --> 27:52.208
-But the dustbin is empty.
-Yes, sir.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.291
Do I look like a fool to you?

27:55.708 --> 27:57.250
Or does this police station look
like a mental asylum?

27:57.458 --> 28:00.000
Sir, it was Lakshmi who saved
my daughter’s life.

28:00.541 --> 28:02.166
-So please help me find her.
-Hey!

28:02.666 --> 28:04.291
Look, I'm already quite upset!

28:04.875 --> 28:06.958
Stop irritating me and leave!

28:07.208 --> 28:08.500
Missing dustbin, my foot!

28:08.750 --> 28:11.250
Please find my Lakshmi
before my daughter returns, sir.

28:12.375 --> 28:13.333
Or else, I will…

28:14.333 --> 28:15.500
How dare you point your finger?

28:15.875 --> 28:18.625
Or else what? What will you do?!

28:19.041 --> 28:20.208
Say it! What will you do?

28:20.291 --> 28:22.458
What will you do?
What the hell can you do?

28:22.625 --> 28:24.166
What will you do? Tell me!

28:24.250 --> 28:25.125
I will…

28:26.000 --> 28:27.583
file a complaint against you
with higher officials.

28:27.791 --> 28:31.000
You'll complain to my superiors?
Go ahead! Do it, I say!

28:31.208 --> 28:32.958
Go and complain to the IG!
I'll face it!

28:33.166 --> 28:35.958
-Where are you running?
-Please leave me. Please.

28:36.041 --> 28:37.416
Sir, why aren't you taking my complaint?

28:37.500 --> 28:42.000
-Sir… My Lakshmi…
-Let go of me! Leave me!

28:42.083 --> 28:43.625
Don't hit him, sir.

28:45.416 --> 28:46.291
Sir!

28:47.125 --> 28:49.208
-Why are you hitting him?
-Shut up!

28:49.291 --> 28:50.125
Sir…

28:50.541 --> 28:52.750
Sir, he seems to be a madman.

28:52.875 --> 28:54.375
This could become an issue.

28:54.458 --> 28:57.375
Don't listen to him. I'm not crazy.
Please find my Lakshmi, sir.

28:57.541 --> 28:58.916
-You think he's crazy?
-Sir…

28:59.000 --> 29:01.125
-He's driving us crazy! Throw him out!
-Sir, please find my Lakshmi.

29:01.208 --> 29:02.916
-Thrown him out! Now!
-Sir, my Lakshmi…

29:03.000 --> 29:04.791
-Sir, my Lakshmi.
-Throw him out!

29:04.875 --> 29:07.958
-Come on, throw him out.
-Please find my Lakshmi, sir.

29:08.041 --> 29:11.875
-Pull him! Come on!
-Sir, please. Find my Lakshmi.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.333
-Sir, my Lakshmi…
-Bite him!

29:13.666 --> 29:14.833
Sir, my Lakshmi…

29:15.666 --> 29:17.125
Sir! Please find my Lakshmi, sir!

29:19.333 --> 29:20.791
Please find my Lakshmi, sir!

29:21.833 --> 29:23.291
I won't let go of the grip, sir!

29:23.458 --> 29:26.333
-It's about to break!
-Please find my Lakshmi, sir.

29:28.250 --> 29:29.291
Hey!

29:38.541 --> 29:39.708
Snake!

29:39.791 --> 29:41.000
A snake! Run!

29:41.583 --> 29:42.416
Get out!

29:43.500 --> 29:44.500
Sir!

29:45.625 --> 29:47.041
Run! Everybody run!

29:47.125 --> 29:48.083
Let's go!

29:48.250 --> 29:50.375
-Come!
-Run…

29:55.083 --> 29:56.750
Move!

30:18.083 --> 30:19.375
Put it down! It might bite you!

30:19.458 --> 30:22.541
Put it down. It's a snake!

30:23.041 --> 30:24.500
Put the snake down!

30:24.791 --> 30:26.625
-Are you crazy? Put it down!
-Put the snake down!

30:26.833 --> 30:28.250
Let the inspector come,
and we'll discuss your case.

30:28.333 --> 30:29.416
Put it down!

30:29.500 --> 30:30.375
Put it down!

31:38.375 --> 31:39.625
So the key was placed there?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.041
-Sir?
-I asked, was the key placed there?

31:42.208 --> 31:43.041
Yes, sir.

31:43.208 --> 31:45.791
I just searched,
and all the keys were here.

31:45.875 --> 31:46.708
-You!
-Dad, no.

31:48.250 --> 31:50.708
-You steal in my house and--
-Sir, hold on. Sir…

31:52.416 --> 31:54.625
If he gets hurt,
we'll have to answer to the magistrate.

31:54.791 --> 31:56.333
Was going to Tirupathi temple a mistake?

31:56.416 --> 31:58.000
He has robbed us completely!

31:58.083 --> 32:01.333
Was it the Tirupathi God's order
to leave the keys on top of the cupboard?

32:01.791 --> 32:03.833
It's your house,
and you must safeguard it.

32:04.041 --> 32:05.791
Come on, sir! 680 grams of gold, sir!

32:05.875 --> 32:08.625
Didn't we recover it?
Calm down, sir.

32:18.208 --> 32:19.041
Here you go, sir.

32:26.625 --> 32:27.458
Check it.

32:29.958 --> 32:32.166
Sir, this is an awesome house
that you've built.

32:32.416 --> 32:34.041
It must have cost you 30 million, right?

32:34.166 --> 32:35.875
Which era are you living in, sir?

32:35.958 --> 32:38.916
Including the grand interior decoration,
it cost me 70 million.

32:39.208 --> 32:41.125
My house steals the show
in this whole locality.

32:43.208 --> 32:45.041
-Keep it inside…
-Sir…

32:45.125 --> 32:47.041
Sir, I was told
that you work in the RTO department.

32:47.708 --> 32:50.250
So your salary, after deductions,
must be 60,000 per month.

32:50.583 --> 32:51.958
Then how did you build such a grand…

32:52.875 --> 32:53.750
What did you say?

32:54.500 --> 32:57.041
Who are you to question that, sir?
Are you from the Income Tax department?

32:57.125 --> 32:58.541
Why are you bothered about my earnings?

32:58.958 --> 33:00.458
Let the IT department come!

33:00.750 --> 33:02.791
I have the correct documents
and will present them.

33:04.541 --> 33:05.791
-Where should I sign?
-Here, sir.

33:10.791 --> 33:11.666
You may leave, sir.

33:17.291 --> 33:18.166
Blame it all on fate!

33:18.250 --> 33:20.166
-Sir!
-That's true.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.083
-Sir!
-Sir!

33:22.291 --> 33:23.500
-Sir!
-Sir!

33:24.541 --> 33:27.458
Sir, the jewels you handed over to us
are all fake gold!

33:28.291 --> 33:31.250
-You wasted our time on fake gold?
-No, sir!

33:31.333 --> 33:32.750
Our jewels are pure gold.

33:32.833 --> 33:34.416
The ones you handed over to us are fake.

33:36.583 --> 33:39.666
The designs are a perfect match,
and that's what we retrieved for you.

33:39.750 --> 33:41.291
Sir, the designs look the same,

33:41.375 --> 33:43.375
but this is fake gold,
whereas ours was pure gold.

33:45.000 --> 33:45.916
Bring him here.

33:46.416 --> 33:47.750
Hey, come.

33:49.791 --> 33:50.625
Where are the jewels?

33:51.250 --> 33:53.833
-Sir, I handed them over to you.
-He claims that it's all fake gold.

33:53.916 --> 33:55.625
-Where's the gold?
-Sir, I stole only these.

33:55.708 --> 33:57.833
-You stole these? Where's the gold?
-Sir!

33:57.916 --> 33:58.791
-Where are they?
-Sir!

33:58.875 --> 34:00.791
-Where are the original jewels?
-Sir, it hurts. Please, sir.

34:01.916 --> 34:02.750
Sir!

34:03.708 --> 34:06.083
Hey, 680 grams of gold jewels were stolen,

34:06.291 --> 34:09.833
and the recovered amount is 696 grams?
Can't you duplicate it properly?

34:10.041 --> 34:12.541
Sir, what if the owner finds out?

34:13.708 --> 34:14.833
-We'll manage.
-It hurts!

34:14.916 --> 34:15.750
It hurts? My foot!

34:16.458 --> 34:18.416
-Where are the gold jewels?
-He told me it's gold.

34:18.500 --> 34:21.500
-But now he's saying otherwise.
-He's lying, sir!

34:21.583 --> 34:23.791
-Are you both cheating the government?
-No, sir.

34:23.875 --> 34:25.958
-No, sir. Not at all.
-Sait, you jerk!

34:26.041 --> 34:28.958
Didn't you ask why we are bothered
about your earnings?

34:29.083 --> 34:30.041
So this is how you earned it all?

34:30.125 --> 34:31.666
-No, sir.
-No?

34:31.750 --> 34:32.666
-No…
-Then how?

34:32.750 --> 34:34.166
-Sir, leave it. Sir…
-Leave what?

34:34.458 --> 34:36.125
-Go inside. Now!
-Just leave it, sir.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.458
Do you need
special instructions, ma'am? Go!

34:39.958 --> 34:42.458
"Seventy million! I have the documents!

34:43.166 --> 34:45.083
Steals the show in this whole locality!"
I'll tear you apart!

34:59.791 --> 35:00.666
Here you go.

35:02.875 --> 35:05.291
If you need anything,
come home and inform my wife. Okay?

35:06.458 --> 35:09.125
Amudha, take care of yourself
and the baby.

35:09.708 --> 35:10.833
I'll be out of prison soon.

35:13.916 --> 35:14.750
-Sir!
-Sir!

35:23.500 --> 35:25.041
Sir, please change your shirt.
Wear this one.

35:25.333 --> 35:27.916
A dustbin story has turned
the police station into a dustbin.

35:28.000 --> 35:28.833
Sir is here.

35:29.875 --> 35:30.708
Sir…

35:36.958 --> 35:37.791
What happened?

35:37.958 --> 35:39.708
Did some political party
hold a conference in our police station?

35:52.125 --> 35:53.000
Greetings, sir.

36:03.541 --> 36:05.041
So tell me, Maharaja,

36:05.333 --> 36:07.000
what's the issue in your kingdom
under your reign?

36:07.458 --> 36:08.750
Sir, my name is Maharaja.

36:09.583 --> 36:11.291
I run a salon in K.K. Nagar.

36:11.750 --> 36:13.583
I reside at Bharathi Nagar, Pallikaranai.

36:13.958 --> 36:15.458
Last night, around ten o'clock,

36:15.750 --> 36:17.375
-I returned home after closing my shop.
-There he goes again.

36:17.791 --> 36:19.250
I unlocked the door
and entered the house.

36:19.791 --> 36:21.416
-Got a cigarette?
-I switched on the living room light.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.500
Then, I removed the bag
from my shoulder and placed it down.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.833
Then I went inside the room to change.

36:26.291 --> 36:29.833
Suddenly, I heard a noise from behind.

36:30.375 --> 36:31.666
I turned around.

36:31.833 --> 36:33.583
There were two of them, wearing masks.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.208
A third guy…
I think he was hiding in the living room.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.958
-He rushed toward me--
-Wait.

36:39.375 --> 36:42.083
So they broke into your house
even before you arrived?

36:42.166 --> 36:43.541
-Oh, come on! Move.
-Yes, sir.

36:44.125 --> 36:47.375
Sir, he's telling you
the exact same story he told me.

36:47.458 --> 36:50.416
-A dustbin is missing from his house.
-What? A dustbin?

36:50.583 --> 36:52.875
Yes, sir. A dustbin worth 300 rupees.

36:53.250 --> 36:56.166
Three unidentified thieves
broke into his house to steal it.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.666
They attacked him and stole it.

36:57.791 --> 36:59.083
He wants to file a police report,
it seems.

36:59.166 --> 37:00.083
Look!

37:00.208 --> 37:04.083
People get no justice here
even when their lives are in danger,

37:04.333 --> 37:07.208
and here you are,
creating a ruckus over losing a dustbin.

37:08.166 --> 37:09.000
Here!

37:09.208 --> 37:11.541
Buy yourself a new dustbin
and never show your face here again.

37:12.875 --> 37:14.875
Sir, I don't want a new one.

37:15.541 --> 37:16.875
I want my Lakshmi back.

37:16.958 --> 37:19.333
-Lakshmi?
-That's the dustbin's name, sir.

37:19.416 --> 37:21.541
-A dustbin with a name?
-They don't understand, sir.

37:22.166 --> 37:24.166
Lakshmi saved my daughter's life.

37:24.250 --> 37:26.250
-That is our--
-How can a dustbin save a life?

37:26.541 --> 37:28.291
Sir, Lakshmi is made of iron.

37:28.875 --> 37:29.916
When the house collapsed,

37:30.208 --> 37:32.250
it fell on my daughter,
covered her, and saved her.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.250
Just tell me, what do you want?

37:34.541 --> 37:36.083
Lakshmi is the deity
that resides in our home.

37:36.833 --> 37:39.416
My daughter will ask for Lakshmi
as soon as she returns from camp.

37:40.208 --> 37:41.583
Please help me find Lakshmi, sir.

37:42.083 --> 37:43.583
Fine, we'll find it.

37:44.041 --> 37:45.750
Just answer my questions properly.

37:46.625 --> 37:49.833
Usually, criminals leave clues.
Did you find any?

37:50.083 --> 37:51.125
-No, sir.
-Okay.

37:51.208 --> 37:53.916
They must have talked to each other
while stealing your dustbin.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.208
Did they speak Tamil
or some other language?

37:56.708 --> 37:57.625
Can you identify them?

38:01.583 --> 38:03.208
Sir, all three had masks on.

38:03.291 --> 38:04.291
-Hey!
-Right!

38:04.458 --> 38:06.625
Obviously! They won't come naked
to rob a house!

38:07.291 --> 38:10.125
Apart from the dustbin,
what else did they steal?

38:10.416 --> 38:12.166
-Nothing else, sir.
-Nothing?

38:12.333 --> 38:15.541
He's been telling the same story
since morning, and it's driving me crazy.

38:15.916 --> 38:17.500
-Sir, just throw him out.
-Sir…

38:18.625 --> 38:21.041
I'd honestly tell you
if something else was stolen.

38:21.125 --> 38:22.000
Hey!

38:23.375 --> 38:25.708
One slap and your head will roll!

38:26.416 --> 38:30.166
You say they stole an empty dustbin
and nothing else?

38:30.291 --> 38:32.041
Were they indeed thieves or madmen?

38:32.125 --> 38:34.083
Look, your story doesn't sound believable.

38:34.291 --> 38:37.125
Tell me one thing that's believable,
and I will take up this case.

38:37.291 --> 38:40.166
Otherwise, I'll put you in prison
for creating a ruckus here

38:40.250 --> 38:41.333
and break your knees.

38:51.541 --> 38:53.250
Sir, I noticed something
peculiar about one of them.

38:54.083 --> 38:55.041
What was it?

38:55.166 --> 38:57.166
-When the three of them were hitting me,
-Yes…

38:57.750 --> 38:59.583
I pushed them away, asking them to stop.

39:00.125 --> 39:04.208
During the fight, one of the guy's shirts
got hooked on a nail and tore.

39:05.083 --> 39:06.333
I saw his back, sir.

39:08.208 --> 39:09.083
On his back…

39:10.583 --> 39:12.250
-On his back…
-On his back?

39:16.708 --> 39:17.750
On his back…

39:19.875 --> 39:21.250
there was an ear protruding out.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.458
-An ear on the back?
-Yes, sir.

39:24.541 --> 39:25.583
Now, this is interesting.

39:25.791 --> 39:26.916
I saw it with my own eyes, sir.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.625
An ear on the back…

39:30.750 --> 39:33.125
Sir, I have a doubt.

39:34.208 --> 39:35.916
If we cover his two ears,

39:36.208 --> 39:38.208
can he still hear
with the ear in his back?

39:38.416 --> 39:40.250
-Please ask him.
-Who's that fellow?

39:40.500 --> 39:41.333
Police, sir.

39:41.458 --> 39:43.166
-Police?
-No, sir.

39:43.375 --> 39:45.083
That's his name, but he's a thief.

39:45.541 --> 39:46.458
He steals TVS 50 mopeds.

39:46.875 --> 39:48.875
So far, he has stolen 27 TVS 50s.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.375
He even stole my father-in-law's TVS 50.
I was inquiring about it.

40:02.833 --> 40:05.125
There are millions of costly bikes,

40:05.416 --> 40:06.875
so why steal
the TVS 50 brand in particular?

40:07.166 --> 40:10.750
-Sir, I don't ride bikes with gears.
-Oh, really?

40:11.250 --> 40:13.250
-Shall I teach you?
-Sir…

40:13.333 --> 40:15.333
-Sir, how do you want me to stand?
-However you wish.

40:15.416 --> 40:18.166
Sir, move. I have to get beatings.

40:21.666 --> 40:22.958
-Did he come prepared for this?
-Ready, sir.

40:24.333 --> 40:27.625
How dare you steal?
Stealing only TVS 50s, my foot!

40:27.708 --> 40:31.583
-These people are a pain in the head!
-Rascal!

40:31.958 --> 40:32.958
Oh, God!

40:33.958 --> 40:38.125
You have questions?
And how dare you steal?

40:38.541 --> 40:40.333
-You want to trouble the cops?
-Don't go there.

40:41.250 --> 40:42.750
-Sir…
-Oh, God!

40:42.833 --> 40:43.666
Sir…

40:45.708 --> 40:46.958
Sir, if you cannot take up my case,

40:47.625 --> 40:50.291
at least recommend
moving Lakshmi's case to CBI.

40:50.583 --> 40:52.416
-CBI?
-He's going to die today.

40:53.958 --> 40:54.916
-Don't leave him.
-Come on, lift him.

40:55.000 --> 40:55.875
Hold him.

40:55.958 --> 40:57.541
-Look, he's kicking his leg.
-Hold his leg.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.083
Sir… Sir, my Lakshmi!

41:00.500 --> 41:01.708
Sir, please find my Lakshmi.

41:02.250 --> 41:03.083
Grab him!

41:03.166 --> 41:05.875
He's trying to hold something.
Don't let him!

41:07.791 --> 41:09.375
Sir, Lakshmi…

41:09.625 --> 41:11.000
Sir, please help me find my Lakshmi.

41:11.333 --> 41:12.166
Sir!

41:18.625 --> 41:19.458
Hey!

41:20.041 --> 41:22.291
Take one step forward,
and I'll shoot you down!

41:22.583 --> 41:24.125
I dare you!

41:24.416 --> 41:25.250
I dare you!

41:25.791 --> 41:26.625
Hey!

41:32.083 --> 41:33.625
Leave! I said, leave!

41:35.125 --> 41:36.666
I shouldn't see you around. Leave.

41:39.416 --> 41:40.708
Leave! Now!

41:41.958 --> 41:42.833
You heard me! Leave!

41:52.000 --> 41:53.458
Are you all blind?

41:53.875 --> 41:55.208
Don't you know there's a gun here?

41:55.916 --> 41:57.375
-If you had taken it and pointed at him,
-Sir…

41:57.458 --> 41:58.875
-he would have run for his life.
-Sir…

41:59.083 --> 42:00.083
See how he ran away?

42:00.166 --> 42:01.125
Do you think he'll dare to come back?

42:02.583 --> 42:04.000
People must fear the police.

42:04.541 --> 42:07.333
There are so many of you here,
yet you couldn't throw a madman out?

42:07.583 --> 42:09.958
Don't call yourselves police!
Aren't you ashamed?

42:14.500 --> 42:15.833
Hey!

42:16.333 --> 42:18.375
-Why are you feeling bad? Are you police?
-Sir?

42:18.833 --> 42:20.875
-Are you police?
-Sir, please! Not the gun.

42:20.958 --> 42:22.916
Please use the baton.
Don't change your habits, sir.

42:23.083 --> 42:24.458
Sir, I'm ready.

42:24.541 --> 42:25.541
-You're so used to beatings
-Sir,

42:25.625 --> 42:26.875
-that you have no fear at all.
-pass him the baton.

42:26.958 --> 42:28.416
-I'll shoot you right there!
-Sir…

42:28.500 --> 42:29.916
-Sir, not the gun. Please.
-Sir…

42:30.000 --> 42:32.250
-No, don't.
-Sir…

42:32.791 --> 42:33.666
It's me, sir.

42:35.791 --> 42:36.708
Sir,

42:37.750 --> 42:39.250
keep this 40,000 rupees as an advance.

42:39.708 --> 42:41.041
Please find my Lakshmi, sir.

42:41.458 --> 42:42.583
I'll pay you five hundred thousand, sir.

42:46.416 --> 42:47.791
Five hundred thousand for a dustbin?

42:52.166 --> 42:53.250
How dare you try to bribe me!

42:58.250 --> 43:00.416
Do you have any sense?

43:00.791 --> 43:02.416
Who accepts bribes in front of people?

43:02.750 --> 43:04.083
Have some respect for the inspector.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.291
Hereafter, deal with me regarding money.

43:07.291 --> 43:08.166
Understood?

43:24.500 --> 43:26.750
Sir, I turned on this switch.

43:27.500 --> 43:28.666
I kept the key over there.

43:29.208 --> 43:30.875
-I placed my bag here.
-Hey! Wait!

43:31.083 --> 43:32.333
-Lakshmi was here.
-Look!

43:32.583 --> 43:35.000
-Don't start again. I'll become furious!
-Sir, Lakshmi…

43:40.958 --> 43:42.958
-Look here, we can't find your dustbin!
-Sir, Lakshmi…

43:43.041 --> 43:45.041
You move the case to CBI.
Just leave me alone! God!

43:45.958 --> 43:47.083
He keeps flapping his gums.

43:47.166 --> 43:48.041
Sir!

43:50.250 --> 43:51.333
They broke in from here.

44:00.458 --> 44:02.083
There is nothing here.

44:10.125 --> 44:13.916
Sir, this shop
would be better off without him.

44:14.291 --> 44:16.291
He can't even perform his job properly.

44:17.041 --> 44:19.875
Even now, he took two days off
without notifying anyone.

44:20.291 --> 44:22.041
He's simply a waste, sir.

44:23.541 --> 44:25.000
-Sir…
-What is it?

44:25.791 --> 44:26.666
Come here.

44:28.375 --> 44:30.458
He has one and a half million rupees
in his savings account.

44:35.958 --> 44:37.375
Dad, this is the TT court.

44:37.708 --> 44:40.250
I don't play this game, but my friends do.

44:40.333 --> 44:41.666
Look, there's Sumathi.

44:41.875 --> 44:43.708
Sumathi, say hi to my dad.

44:44.166 --> 44:46.333
-Hi, Uncle.
-By the way, today's Friday.

44:46.416 --> 44:48.291
Did you clean Lakshmi?
Click a photo and send it to me.

44:50.250 --> 44:53.250
A few days ago, a land revenue officer
had stuffed the bribe he got

44:53.375 --> 44:55.708
into a grinder, mixer, and utensils.

44:55.791 --> 44:57.083
Yes, that guy from Salem.

44:57.583 --> 44:59.208
Sir, just like that,

44:59.541 --> 45:01.333
there's a major illegal stash
in this house.

45:01.625 --> 45:02.833
They must have stolen it.

45:02.916 --> 45:04.833
This guy is hiding something from us.

45:05.041 --> 45:07.083
Sir, based on my calculations,

45:07.375 --> 45:09.291
there's something very valuable
in that dustbin.

45:10.333 --> 45:12.458
If we squash him,

45:13.250 --> 45:14.791
we won't have to work
for small change anymore.

45:14.958 --> 45:16.208
We could make a lot of money.

45:22.458 --> 45:23.333
I don't smoke, sir.

45:24.416 --> 45:26.541
So, is this your own house?

45:26.625 --> 45:29.208
Yes, sir. We moved in here
after my wife passed away.

45:30.541 --> 45:32.250
Do you suspect anyone?

45:32.333 --> 45:34.833
Those who work in nearby fields
or guests who visit you regularly.

45:35.708 --> 45:36.750
No, sir.

45:40.500 --> 45:43.458
Look, I'll be working in this police
station until I retire from service.

45:43.666 --> 45:46.583
Don't be afraid of anyone.
Nobody can harm you while I'm here.

45:46.958 --> 45:49.750
When it comes to thieves,
there are various types.

45:50.041 --> 45:52.833
Chain snatchers,
jewel robbers, vehicle thieves.

45:52.916 --> 45:54.666
They all have a modus operandi.

45:54.958 --> 45:57.958
Now, if we knew
what was really inside the dustbin,

45:58.375 --> 45:59.541
we could find the thief,

45:59.666 --> 46:02.500
their whereabouts,
and where they'll sell it.

46:02.833 --> 46:05.833
Otherwise, we'll have to waste time
roaming around.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.166
-Before your daughter returns--
-Sir, don't beat around the bush.

46:09.833 --> 46:12.625
Not 500,000, I'll add another two
and pay you 700,000.

46:13.666 --> 46:16.166
Please find my Lakshmi
before my daughter returns at any cost.

46:56.625 --> 46:57.500
Where are the onions?

46:58.166 --> 46:59.083
Onions.

46:59.500 --> 47:00.583
Check in the refrigerator.

47:00.666 --> 47:02.416
Who keeps onions in the refrigerator?

47:03.458 --> 47:04.416
They don't?

47:05.708 --> 47:06.541
Sorry, man.

47:08.541 --> 47:09.458
Where are the onions?

47:11.625 --> 47:12.458
In the loft?

47:14.333 --> 47:15.208
In a box?

47:16.250 --> 47:17.500
They're in a box in the loft.

47:18.875 --> 47:20.916
Add some curd to the chicken.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.458
There's no curd in the refrigerator.

47:23.375 --> 47:24.333
You don't have curd at home?

47:26.250 --> 47:28.500
Oh, come on, you don't have curd
in such a huge household?

47:28.750 --> 47:30.291
I wonder how you guys run the family.

47:30.708 --> 47:31.541
Fine, forget it.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.541
The food has come out delicious today!

47:40.875 --> 47:41.833
Five minutes.

47:47.250 --> 47:49.041
Selvam, the food's ready.

47:56.625 --> 47:58.000
Selvam, wait.

47:58.083 --> 47:59.666
Looks like she has something to say.
Let's hear it out.

48:04.208 --> 48:05.083
Speak.

48:05.833 --> 48:08.583
Sir, you took everything you wanted.

48:09.416 --> 48:11.916
Please spare our lives
and leave our house.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.875
Look at that! Even in this situation,

48:13.958 --> 48:16.833
she's telling us what to do.

48:16.916 --> 48:18.083
Sir, no, sir. Not at all.

48:18.458 --> 48:19.750
I didn't mean it that way.

48:20.250 --> 48:21.291
Sir, please, sir.

48:21.958 --> 48:24.625
You are only thinking about yourself.

48:26.250 --> 48:27.500
Spare a thought for us, too.

48:27.583 --> 48:28.708
Please, sir.

48:29.416 --> 48:31.208
So far, wherever we've robbed,

48:31.291 --> 48:35.875
we've never spared anyone
who saw our faces.

48:35.958 --> 48:38.041
-Please, sir.
-But you? Like some daring warrior,

48:38.125 --> 48:40.500
you jumped across,
pulled our masks off, and saw our faces.

48:40.583 --> 48:42.041
-Sir…
-If we spare your lives,

48:42.125 --> 48:45.791
-you'll go to the police.
-No, sir. I won't, sir.

48:45.875 --> 48:47.916
-The police will…
-No…

48:48.000 --> 48:50.083
-No, sir. I won't go to the police.
-I have no choice.

48:50.166 --> 48:52.916
No, sir. We won't go to the police.
We won't utter a word, sir.

48:53.166 --> 48:54.583
Fine, imagine I spare your lives.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.166
What's in it for us?

48:56.458 --> 48:59.000
Sir, didn't you take so many jewels?

48:59.166 --> 49:01.416
You even snatched my nuptial necklace.

49:02.000 --> 49:02.875
Still not enough.

49:07.916 --> 49:08.833
Sir, over there,

49:09.750 --> 49:11.041
in front of the God's portrait,

49:11.458 --> 49:13.250
is my mother-in-law's nuptial necklace.

49:14.875 --> 49:16.208
See that, she's opening up one by one!

49:21.916 --> 49:22.833
Still not enough.

49:25.208 --> 49:28.666
I've kept 20,000 rupees
in the kitchen to pay my daughter's fee.

49:34.625 --> 49:36.041
-Sir, that's all.
-Not enough.

49:36.375 --> 49:37.916
I gave you everything I had.

49:38.083 --> 49:40.083
I swear I don't have anything else, sir.

49:40.166 --> 49:41.041
Really?

49:55.458 --> 49:57.458
I promise I don't have anything else.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.208
You don't have anything?

50:00.125 --> 50:01.000
No, sir.

50:01.708 --> 50:03.250
You've nothing left?

50:04.875 --> 50:07.041
No, sir! No!

50:07.250 --> 50:08.708
-Sir, please get out.
-Hey.

50:08.791 --> 50:10.875
Do you think
you're in a position to refuse?

50:10.958 --> 50:11.875
Sir, please.

50:12.208 --> 50:14.000
She's my child! Please, no, sir.

50:14.083 --> 50:15.166
-Please, sir!
-Selvam?

50:15.250 --> 50:18.583
Please, leave her alone, sir. Sir!

50:18.750 --> 50:20.500
Sir! Please don't!

50:20.583 --> 50:22.583
My child!
Please ask him to leave her!

50:22.666 --> 50:25.250
Sir! Please, sir!

50:25.333 --> 50:26.166
Sir!

50:26.250 --> 50:27.083
Oh, my God!

50:27.250 --> 50:28.083
Sir!

50:29.166 --> 50:30.208
My child! Please, sir!

50:31.500 --> 50:33.625
Abhi! Dear Abhi!

50:36.708 --> 50:38.291
Abhi! Please, sir!

50:39.791 --> 50:40.666
Abhi!

51:07.333 --> 51:09.833
Abhi…

51:10.625 --> 51:11.541
Oh, my.

51:11.708 --> 51:12.583
Abhi…

51:13.041 --> 51:16.500
Her screaming is so nagging.
It's so irritating.

51:17.291 --> 51:18.125
Fine, what do we do with her?

51:42.875 --> 51:43.708
Give it to me.

51:45.583 --> 51:46.791
Who's that?

51:48.416 --> 51:49.875
Where's Ammu?

51:51.583 --> 51:53.625
Hey, catch her. Catch her.

51:57.791 --> 51:58.958
Be careful.

52:02.125 --> 52:03.000
Darling.

52:08.375 --> 52:10.958
Ammu, look what daddy got for you.

52:12.500 --> 52:14.125
Why? You don't want it?

52:14.916 --> 52:15.750
No…

52:16.708 --> 52:17.625
You don't want it?

52:35.458 --> 52:37.541
Excuse me! Come here.

52:39.833 --> 52:42.375
They won't find your dustbin.

52:42.750 --> 52:45.375
Don't waste your money.

52:45.666 --> 52:47.750
The inspector promised me he would
form two special units to look for it.

52:47.833 --> 52:48.791
They will find it soon.

52:51.916 --> 52:55.083
As if this is some Veerappan case
that needs special forces to search!

52:55.333 --> 52:57.708
Look, they won't do anything about it.

52:57.791 --> 52:59.875
They will leave you stranded
until you're stripped bare.

53:02.083 --> 53:04.416
I want a dustbin exactly like this one.

53:05.666 --> 53:07.958
Is this a dustbin?
It looks like a rice cooker.

53:10.250 --> 53:11.958
Sir, this is a new model.

53:12.041 --> 53:14.083
-Not this one, ma'am.
-It's a new model, sir.

53:16.625 --> 53:17.541
Sir…

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
If it's gold that was stolen,
it can't be sold without my knowledge.

53:21.458 --> 53:22.625
I can guarantee you that.

53:29.250 --> 53:31.125
Sir, he refuses to go home.

53:31.208 --> 53:34.375
He says he'll stay here
until we find the dustbin.

53:34.958 --> 53:36.875
Once the duplicate dustbin is here,
he'll leave.

53:37.375 --> 53:40.208
Mr. Dustbin! You garbage.
Come here.

53:40.416 --> 53:42.375
Five biryanis and a pack of cigarettes.

53:44.000 --> 53:44.833
Sir,

53:45.166 --> 53:47.375
-my name is not Dustbin, it's Maharaja.
-I know.

53:53.791 --> 53:55.208
37TH STATE LEVEL ATHLETIC COACHING CAMP
&amp; SELECTION TRIALS - 2023

54:05.750 --> 54:06.625
Okay.

54:07.375 --> 54:08.250
-Anything else?
-That's all.

54:08.333 --> 54:10.291
KOKHILA ELECTRICALS

54:11.833 --> 54:12.666
Hello.

54:15.125 --> 54:15.958
Which area?

54:35.375 --> 54:37.291
Get lost! Look at him and his ugly face!

54:59.708 --> 55:01.916
Make it fast. How long will you take?

55:25.625 --> 55:27.458
It's okay. It will heal soon.

55:29.166 --> 55:30.000
Sir,

55:30.708 --> 55:33.458
-did you want to install a cupboard?
-I informed you three days ago.

55:33.666 --> 55:35.416
Well, sir, I had a lot of pending work.

55:35.500 --> 55:36.750
Fine, the work's in the kitchen.

55:40.250 --> 55:42.000
-Dear, make it fast.
-Coming.

55:45.500 --> 55:47.791
What happened to the baby?
What's with the bandage?

55:47.916 --> 55:50.333
I had some old stuff up in the loft.

55:50.875 --> 55:52.708
When I was taking it down,
it slipped and fell on her.

55:52.791 --> 55:53.625
Oh.

55:54.708 --> 55:55.916
Almost done.

55:56.333 --> 55:57.666
It'll heal in no time, okay?

56:09.125 --> 56:11.333
Call me without fail
after you watch this video.

56:11.541 --> 56:13.416
I called you twice yesterday,
and you didn't answer.

56:13.875 --> 56:14.833
Where are you?

56:14.916 --> 56:16.791
I asked for Lakshmi's photo,
and you haven't sent it yet.

56:21.125 --> 56:24.166
Excuse me, you must've bought this
for only 50 rupees.

56:24.458 --> 56:26.208
But you're selling it for 90 rupees?

56:26.416 --> 56:29.958
Sir, how can we sell it
for the same price we bought it?

56:30.041 --> 56:31.083
Such a huge utensils shop,

56:31.166 --> 56:33.041
-and you don't have this?
-No, we don't!

56:33.125 --> 56:35.125
-Sir, we have many other things here.
-Don't raise your voice at the customer!

56:35.916 --> 56:37.291
Sir, this is a utensils shop!

56:37.416 --> 56:39.041
You're asking for a dustbin here?

56:39.125 --> 56:40.416
And it's an ancient model!

56:40.500 --> 56:42.750
-Where else will I ask? Call the owner!
-Kuzhanthai…

56:42.833 --> 56:45.041
Nallasivam, what are you doing here?

56:45.333 --> 56:46.500
Why are you yelling?

56:46.583 --> 56:48.250
Don't ask me. Give that!

56:49.375 --> 56:52.541
The inspector asked me to buy
a dustbin exactly like this for a case.

56:52.666 --> 56:54.416
And everywhere I go, they keep saying
they don't have it!

56:54.500 --> 56:56.041
We'll say no if we don't have it.

56:56.125 --> 56:58.291
-I'm getting pissed off!
-Sir, please tell him.

56:58.416 --> 57:00.250
He's creating a scene here for a dustbin.

57:00.333 --> 57:02.375
He orders me to call the owner.

57:02.458 --> 57:05.541
-I've been here for ten years--
-But what's the use?

57:05.625 --> 57:06.791
-Kuzhanthai.
-They don't even have a dustbin--

57:07.125 --> 57:08.000
The inspector is calling.

57:10.000 --> 57:10.833
-Sir.
-Kuzhanthai,

57:10.916 --> 57:12.166
which temple's bell are you ringing?

57:12.250 --> 57:15.500
I'm not ringing any bell, sir.
I'm searching for the dustbin.

57:15.583 --> 57:18.375
Somehow, I just can't believe
you're actually working.

57:18.458 --> 57:21.583
Sir, I swear!
Even now, I'm in a shop looking for it.

57:21.666 --> 57:25.166
I met Nallasivam here.
Talk to him if you don't believe me.

57:25.250 --> 57:26.333
-Nallasivam?
-Yes.

57:26.416 --> 57:27.958
What's he doing there?
Give the phone to him.

57:28.041 --> 57:28.916
I'll give it, sir.

57:30.166 --> 57:31.916
-What is it?
-He wants to talk to you.

57:32.250 --> 57:33.291
Sir, tell me.

57:33.375 --> 57:35.916
Nallasivam, what are you doing there?
No work today?

57:36.000 --> 57:37.875
No, sir. Today is my day off.

57:37.958 --> 57:40.416
I need a dustbin for a case.

57:40.500 --> 57:43.250
-Did Kuzhanthai tell you?
-He did show me. I saw it.

57:43.458 --> 57:46.208
I need an exact replica of that one.
A used one.

57:46.291 --> 57:47.458
Find me one.

57:47.583 --> 57:48.500
A used one, sir?

57:49.291 --> 57:51.250
Kuzhanthai is looking for a brand-new one.

57:51.333 --> 57:52.833
I knew he'd mess up like this.

57:52.916 --> 57:55.791
-Stay with him and get this done.
-Definitely, sir.

57:55.875 --> 57:56.791
-Okay.
-Okay, sir.

57:58.625 --> 58:00.666
I need the last 20 days of

58:00.750 --> 58:02.458
incoming and outgoing call details
for this number.

58:02.583 --> 58:06.083
Also, I need the locations it's been in.

58:06.625 --> 58:08.291
T-18 station?
Inspector Varadhan, right?

58:08.416 --> 58:09.250
Yes, sir.

58:09.708 --> 58:10.958
With the last case, he bought a car.

58:11.208 --> 58:12.250
Is he going to buy an apartment
with this one?

58:12.333 --> 58:13.916
Sir, we are dealing with this legally.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.375
I know how well you deal
with things legally. Wait for a moment.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.416
We have to toil hard
for them to make a fortune.

58:19.583 --> 58:21.916
The dustbin that I showed you
in the photo,

58:22.000 --> 58:23.541
how much do you think it costs?

58:23.875 --> 58:26.083
It must cost around 500 to 600 rupees.

58:27.916 --> 58:31.833
But a guy is ready to pay us
700,000 if we find it for him.

58:31.958 --> 58:32.833
Your thoughts on that?

58:33.208 --> 58:35.833
If someone's paying a bribe
in the hundreds of thousands,

58:35.916 --> 58:37.666
then he's hiding something
worth tens of millions.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.958
Don't let go of him. He's got something
really big that he's hiding.

58:41.291 --> 58:42.166
Mr. Dustbin!

58:43.416 --> 58:44.291
You garbage!

58:50.000 --> 58:51.458
-Sir.
-Come here.

58:52.125 --> 58:54.833
Never enter the control room, even if
anyone from here calls you. Got it?

58:56.750 --> 58:57.625
Then why did you enter now?

58:58.708 --> 58:59.750
You called me.

58:59.833 --> 59:03.166
I told you! Don't enter even if anyone
from here calls you. Get lost!

59:05.291 --> 59:06.250
The number's not reachable.

59:06.375 --> 59:09.666
-I don't know his whereabouts, sir.
-Did you inquire around?

59:09.750 --> 59:11.916
I did, sir, but nobody knows.

59:13.083 --> 59:14.791
-Name?
-Prabhu, sir.

59:15.208 --> 59:18.500
I mean, the name of your friend
who's missing?

59:18.583 --> 59:19.416
Dhana, sir.

59:19.625 --> 59:22.291
-He works with me in the garage--
-Stop!

59:22.583 --> 59:23.625
You can give all those details inside.

59:24.625 --> 59:26.416
The writer has stepped out to smoke.
He'll be back.

59:27.791 --> 59:30.958
-Do you have his photo and details?
-Yes, on my mobile.

59:31.041 --> 59:33.416
Everything's on mobile these days.
Do you have a hard copy of his photo?

59:33.500 --> 59:34.833
A friend is bringing it.

59:37.333 --> 59:40.166
I told you this would be a headache.
But you didn't listen to me.

59:42.041 --> 59:43.791
Looks like Karunakaran is on his way
with his lawyer.

59:44.375 --> 59:45.208
Move!

59:47.541 --> 59:48.750
THOSE WHO LIVE BY RIGHTEOUSNESS
DO NOT FALL INTO DISGRACE,

59:48.833 --> 59:50.041
KNOWING THE HARM CAUSED
BY UNRIGHTEOUSNESS.

1:00:47.291 --> 1:00:48.125
Tell me, sir.

1:00:48.625 --> 1:00:50.500
The white colored car parked outside,

1:00:50.583 --> 1:00:51.625
-whose car is it?
-The Fortuner?

1:00:51.708 --> 1:00:53.541
It belongs to our councilor. There he is.

1:00:59.708 --> 1:01:00.708
Pour some more water.

1:01:02.750 --> 1:01:03.666
What do you want?

1:01:04.166 --> 1:01:05.291
I am Maharaja.

1:01:05.541 --> 1:01:06.541
Maharaja?

1:01:06.958 --> 1:01:07.875
King of which kingdom?

1:01:09.916 --> 1:01:10.791
Go ahead, tell me.

1:01:11.125 --> 1:01:14.291
Your car that's parked outside, TN10AT…

1:01:14.375 --> 1:01:17.375
So you were the one who inquired
at my home this afternoon?

1:01:20.083 --> 1:01:22.500
Did those car robbers take you for a ride?

1:01:22.583 --> 1:01:26.791
I told you, Karna!
They roamed all over the place last night.

1:01:26.875 --> 1:01:29.041
I don't care if they took my car,

1:01:29.125 --> 1:01:31.041
but they stole my hero Kunal's sunglasses!

1:01:31.125 --> 1:01:35.166
I've given him a day's time, or else
tomorrow morning, I'll rip him apart!

1:01:35.458 --> 1:01:37.125
He doesn't know whom he's messing with.

1:01:41.208 --> 1:01:43.833
Sir, the guy who took your car last night,

1:01:43.916 --> 1:01:45.000
any idea where he is now?

1:01:46.041 --> 1:01:47.708
Here. Get lost!

1:01:48.291 --> 1:01:49.250
Who in the hell is he?

1:01:52.916 --> 1:01:54.541
You shouldn't have let him go so easily.

1:01:54.625 --> 1:01:55.875
You should've beaten him up even more.

1:01:56.291 --> 1:02:00.041
In a similar case, a guy in Kerala
bought a second-hand Benz.

1:02:00.666 --> 1:02:02.583
Only when he left his car
for service did he find out

1:02:02.875 --> 1:02:04.416
it wasn't a Benz but a cheap car.

1:02:05.333 --> 1:02:08.458
See how they trick people,
just like in the movies!

1:02:11.666 --> 1:02:12.583
I'll finish you off today!

1:02:13.958 --> 1:02:14.875
Hey!

1:02:30.041 --> 1:02:30.958
Hey!

1:02:32.083 --> 1:02:33.458
You roam around in my car,

1:02:33.666 --> 1:02:35.000
and on top of that, you beat me up?

1:02:38.125 --> 1:02:39.083
I won't spare you.

1:04:19.875 --> 1:04:20.916
Bro, wait!

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.083
Mr. Barber.

1:04:24.875 --> 1:04:26.541
What's up? All good?

1:04:27.125 --> 1:04:28.875
I should have killed you
when I broke into your house.

1:04:29.541 --> 1:04:30.833
I show you pity,

1:04:31.375 --> 1:04:32.708
and you're tailing me?

1:04:33.208 --> 1:04:34.916
Do you love me so much?

1:04:35.458 --> 1:04:38.791
Dhana, who is he?
Where did you find him?

1:04:38.875 --> 1:04:41.625
Well, he's a nobody.

1:04:42.208 --> 1:04:44.541
Instead of eating
and sleeping like a common man,

1:04:44.750 --> 1:04:47.083
-how dare you disturb us?
-No, wait!

1:04:47.416 --> 1:04:48.916
Don't finish him off so quickly.

1:04:49.041 --> 1:04:50.833
Chop his arms and legs one by one.

1:04:51.208 --> 1:04:52.833
I need some entertainment
to go with my booze.

1:04:53.041 --> 1:04:54.500
Or else I would have already killed him.

1:04:54.833 --> 1:04:55.666
Hey.

1:04:56.416 --> 1:04:57.458
Stretch his hand out.

1:04:58.000 --> 1:04:58.875
Move.

1:05:13.666 --> 1:05:16.333
I said, stretch his hand out!

1:05:23.333 --> 1:05:25.666
Stop shaking and hold it properly.

1:06:10.625 --> 1:06:12.291
I only want to kill him.

1:06:13.333 --> 1:06:14.875
I'm sure you all have families.

1:06:15.833 --> 1:06:17.166
So forget what happened here and leave.

1:06:17.541 --> 1:06:18.375
Leave!

1:06:18.708 --> 1:06:19.666
I said, leave!

1:06:49.291 --> 1:06:50.500
Hey, give me that.

1:06:57.791 --> 1:06:59.000
Did I feed you biscuits?

1:06:59.250 --> 1:07:00.500
Why are you tailing me like a dog?

1:07:36.791 --> 1:07:37.666
Hey!

1:08:37.250 --> 1:08:38.916
You are one of the three
who broke into my house.

1:08:40.916 --> 1:08:41.875
Who are the other two?

1:08:42.541 --> 1:08:43.458
Tell me!

1:08:45.208 --> 1:08:48.416
Whether I reveal who they are or not,
you'll kill me anyway.

1:08:49.208 --> 1:08:50.083
So why should I tell you?

1:08:53.208 --> 1:08:54.583
Tell me…

1:09:00.083 --> 1:09:01.708
I'll tell you…

1:09:01.791 --> 1:09:03.708
I'll tell you…

1:09:13.916 --> 1:09:15.958
One of them is
at the police station in your locality.

1:09:16.291 --> 1:09:17.708
Find out who he is if you can.

1:09:17.791 --> 1:09:18.958
Go, find out. Okay?

1:09:19.541 --> 1:09:20.625
Find out if you can!

1:09:27.875 --> 1:09:28.708
Hey!

1:10:10.416 --> 1:10:11.291
I'll go to the police station!

1:10:13.208 --> 1:10:15.333
I'll chop his head off,
just like I chopped yours!

1:10:36.916 --> 1:10:38.291
Whose photo is that, sir?
Your friend?

1:10:39.375 --> 1:10:40.208
A friend?

1:10:40.458 --> 1:10:42.291
He dragged me
into huge trouble and escaped.

1:10:42.375 --> 1:10:43.791
He's been missing for three days now.

1:10:43.875 --> 1:10:46.750
I have no idea where he is
or what happened to him! No idea at all.

1:10:48.791 --> 1:10:50.083
It's frustrating, sir.

1:10:56.708 --> 1:10:58.958
Don't worry. You'll find him.

1:10:59.416 --> 1:11:01.625
I'm also here
because something of mine is missing.

1:11:01.708 --> 1:11:02.583
What is that?

1:11:03.500 --> 1:11:04.333
Well…

1:11:04.875 --> 1:11:05.916
-Lakshmi--
-Hey!

1:11:10.583 --> 1:11:11.750
Do you not have any connections

1:11:12.541 --> 1:11:13.458
at the police station?

1:11:13.958 --> 1:11:16.416
Anyone who knows both you and your friend.
Why don't you ask them?

1:11:16.666 --> 1:11:18.083
Nope, I don't know anybody here.

1:11:18.166 --> 1:11:19.625
This mongrel is the one who's always

1:11:19.708 --> 1:11:21.541
going back and forth
to the police station and prison!

1:11:22.125 --> 1:11:24.208
I mortgaged my house
and lent him one million.

1:11:24.666 --> 1:11:26.333
If not repaid on time,
then my head is on the line.

1:11:27.083 --> 1:11:28.041
Put your trust in God.

1:11:28.958 --> 1:11:29.791
You'll find him.

1:11:35.666 --> 1:11:36.541
Oh, God.

1:11:37.833 --> 1:11:39.125
Listen, Mr. Lawyer,

1:11:40.333 --> 1:11:42.583
-speak clearly and bring this to a close.
-Okay, sir.

1:11:47.958 --> 1:11:51.125
Sir, it's true that
I caused an issue at his service station.

1:11:51.333 --> 1:11:53.750
That guy broke the sunglasses
that my hero Kunal gave me.

1:11:53.833 --> 1:11:55.000
Wouldn't that make anyone furious?

1:11:55.083 --> 1:11:57.083
So I just roughed him up.

1:11:57.208 --> 1:11:58.375
They are here for such a silly matter.

1:11:58.458 --> 1:12:00.291
See that, sir? He confessed.

1:12:00.375 --> 1:12:01.541
Arrest him and investigate.

1:12:01.625 --> 1:12:04.500
Arrest me? You fool.

1:12:04.583 --> 1:12:08.250
-Fool? I'd have bashed you the other day.
-Stop it. Look!

1:12:08.333 --> 1:12:11.541
You had a feud with him last.
Tell us what you did to him.

1:12:11.625 --> 1:12:14.875
If I find out the truth, I won't care that
you're a politician. I'll beat you up!

1:12:14.958 --> 1:12:18.458
Look at me. Like a poet,
I'm always gazing at the sky and talking.

1:12:18.541 --> 1:12:22.791
That kid beat me up really bad at the bar.
So badly that my neck has gone stiff.

1:12:22.875 --> 1:12:26.375
How can I talk about it in public?
It'll be so embarrassing for me.

1:12:26.458 --> 1:12:27.625
You know that very well, sir.

1:12:28.083 --> 1:12:29.333
Remember anything else from that night?

1:12:29.416 --> 1:12:31.625
Anything else?

1:12:32.666 --> 1:12:35.541
Yes, sir. Before that guy came to the bar,

1:12:35.625 --> 1:12:37.458
another fellow came to me
asking about him.

1:12:37.791 --> 1:12:40.375
-Who was that?
-He told me his name.

1:12:40.541 --> 1:12:41.916
His name is…

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.791
A very nice name. It's almost
on the tip of my tongue but…

1:12:44.875 --> 1:12:45.708
NO RECOMMENDATION IS REQUIRED
TO MEET THE POLICE INSPECTOR

1:12:45.791 --> 1:12:47.291
What did he say his name was?

1:12:48.333 --> 1:12:50.250
-His name…
-Hey!

1:12:50.541 --> 1:12:52.333
Leave! Tell me when you recollect it. Go!

1:12:52.416 --> 1:12:54.083
Okay, sir. See you.

1:12:54.291 --> 1:12:55.458
-Thanks, sir.
-Move!

1:13:01.458 --> 1:13:04.375
Niranjan, these guys look suspicious.

1:13:04.666 --> 1:13:07.250
If we dig deep into the issue,
we might strike gold.

1:13:08.125 --> 1:13:09.791
Excuse me, brother.

1:13:10.250 --> 1:13:11.208
Move over a little bit.

1:13:11.916 --> 1:13:12.833
Oh, God.

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:19.916
God.

1:13:20.916 --> 1:13:22.583
His name…

1:13:23.375 --> 1:13:24.708
What did he say it was?

1:13:25.916 --> 1:13:27.333
His name…

1:13:27.416 --> 1:13:28.708
Inquire about Dhana.

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:30.625
-Trace details using his number.
-Okay, sir.

1:13:30.708 --> 1:13:33.250
Otherwise, they will mess things up,
and we'll have to run around.

1:13:33.708 --> 1:13:34.875
His name…

1:13:37.500 --> 1:13:39.541
Sir! His name is…

1:13:42.458 --> 1:13:45.000
-Sir, I got his name!
-What is his name?

1:13:45.208 --> 1:13:46.041
Illayaraja.

1:13:48.458 --> 1:13:50.458
Get lost! Look at him
and his hairstyle, jerk!

1:13:50.958 --> 1:13:52.250
I guess he is a Rahman fan.

1:14:22.666 --> 1:14:23.541
Hey!

1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:26.833
What's wrong with you?
Watching a man getting dressed!

1:14:27.083 --> 1:14:28.291
Your cigarettes, sir.

1:14:33.708 --> 1:14:34.875
K. KALIMUTHU

1:14:40.500 --> 1:14:42.291
-Tell me, dear.
-We're leaving home.

1:14:42.541 --> 1:14:45.166
We'll take a rickshaw.
Will you come directly to the shop?

1:14:45.333 --> 1:14:46.708
Listen, an important thing.

1:14:47.125 --> 1:14:49.875
Your daughter will keep asking
for things at the shop.

1:14:50.458 --> 1:14:52.583
Do not buy everything she asks for.

1:14:52.958 --> 1:14:55.291
Just buy what we can afford.

1:14:55.458 --> 1:14:56.708
-Got it?
-Okay, dear.

1:14:56.875 --> 1:14:59.375
It's too hot outside.
Take care of Ammu.

1:14:59.958 --> 1:15:02.458
"Palani Engine-err Works."

1:15:02.541 --> 1:15:04.541
He couldn't even write that properly!

1:15:04.625 --> 1:15:06.083
Will he do a good job?

1:15:06.166 --> 1:15:09.958
Kuzhanthai, these days,
it's the uneducated who do a neat job.

1:15:10.208 --> 1:15:12.416
-Fine, come.
-Let's go and meet that "Engine-err."

1:15:17.333 --> 1:15:19.375
-I hope he'll do a neat job.
-I'll do it, sir.

1:15:19.875 --> 1:15:21.083
It's 1.5 by 1.5 in size.

1:15:21.375 --> 1:15:23.333
-Come back the day after tomorrow.
-The day after tomorrow?

1:15:23.666 --> 1:15:26.166
The inspector said it's urgent,
and he's saying come back in two days.

1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.083
-Please…
-This is not magic.

1:15:29.166 --> 1:15:31.083
I've got to get the pattern right.
It'll take time.

1:15:31.166 --> 1:15:32.166
I promise to do a neat job.

1:15:32.666 --> 1:15:33.625
Fine, ask how much?

1:15:33.916 --> 1:15:35.750
-How much will it cost?
-2,500 rupees, sir.

1:15:36.750 --> 1:15:38.083
2,500 rupees?

1:15:38.458 --> 1:15:39.875
You told me it'd cost 500 to 600 rupees.

1:15:40.291 --> 1:15:42.750
-Look, I am a cop.
-That's why I'm offering a lower price.

1:15:45.250 --> 1:15:47.041
-Okay, do a neat job.
-Don't worry. It'll be perfect.

1:15:49.583 --> 1:15:51.583
Check this model, madam.
This is the current trend.

1:15:52.833 --> 1:15:54.916
-Dad, this one.
-How about this one?

1:15:55.416 --> 1:15:57.375
-What?
-These are the latest models, sir.

1:15:57.458 --> 1:15:58.833
I don't want these models.

1:15:59.125 --> 1:16:00.458
It's for my kid's birthday.

1:16:00.708 --> 1:16:02.750
-So, show me some new and unique models.
-Okay, sir.

1:16:02.833 --> 1:16:04.166
-One moment.
-These look good.

1:16:04.375 --> 1:16:05.541
Why don't you choose one of these?

1:16:05.625 --> 1:16:06.541
Wait, dear.

1:16:08.416 --> 1:16:09.250
-Madam.
-That one.

1:16:09.333 --> 1:16:11.166
-That one? Look at this.
-Check out these ones.

1:16:11.708 --> 1:16:12.583
Look.

1:16:16.791 --> 1:16:19.208
This looks good, right?
How is this one?

1:16:19.708 --> 1:16:20.666
Wow!

1:16:22.875 --> 1:16:23.833
Superb.

1:16:24.208 --> 1:16:25.875
-I knew it.
-Do you like this one?

1:16:26.208 --> 1:16:28.208
-I want this one.
-Shall we buy it?

1:16:29.291 --> 1:16:30.125
It's good.

1:16:30.458 --> 1:16:31.666
-You'll wear it on your birthday, okay?
-This one.

1:16:31.750 --> 1:16:32.583
Good choice, madam.

1:16:32.666 --> 1:16:35.250
It has a rare red diamond.
A classic design, madam.

1:16:35.916 --> 1:16:38.125
They say it has a red diamond.
It might be costly.

1:16:38.208 --> 1:16:40.083
-Let's not buy it.
-Why do you worry about that?

1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:41.625
We don't have that much money.

1:16:41.708 --> 1:16:44.000
Look, don't borrow money for this.

1:16:44.083 --> 1:16:45.541
-Daddy.
-Fine, don't worry about it.

1:16:48.916 --> 1:16:50.333
She likes this. Please bill it.

1:16:50.500 --> 1:16:52.416
Sir, we have to pre-order and make it.

1:16:53.791 --> 1:16:55.583
Her birthday is in two days.

1:16:56.875 --> 1:16:58.708
If it will be very late,
let us know right now.

1:16:58.833 --> 1:17:00.708
It won't take that long.
I'll give it in two days.

1:17:00.916 --> 1:17:02.541
-Will I get it in two days?
-Definitely, sir.

1:17:03.500 --> 1:17:05.458
-It'll look awesome.
-To hell with dad and his daughter.

1:17:16.083 --> 1:17:17.875
Manju, come here.

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:19.875
Tell me.

1:17:20.166 --> 1:17:21.750
With whose permission
did you take my shoes?

1:17:23.791 --> 1:17:25.750
Well, the other day, my shoe ripped.

1:17:25.833 --> 1:17:28.333
-I needed a pair, so I took yours--
-What did I ask?

1:17:28.416 --> 1:17:29.916
Did you ask for my permission?

1:17:30.791 --> 1:17:32.833
Don't you know you must ask for
permission before taking someone's things?

1:17:39.166 --> 1:17:40.541
Fine, leave it. Shall we go and eat?

1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:51.333
Not sleepy?

1:17:52.333 --> 1:17:55.125
Was it necessary to spend
so much on that necklace?

1:17:55.416 --> 1:17:57.000
We must buy only according to our status.

1:17:57.833 --> 1:17:58.916
To hell with status.

1:17:59.708 --> 1:18:00.875
Everything depends on our needs.

1:18:02.125 --> 1:18:03.291
Well, that's what I'm asking.

1:18:03.458 --> 1:18:06.708
What's the need
to buy a diamond necklace for her?

1:18:07.083 --> 1:18:08.416
My daughter's happiness is all I need.

1:18:09.375 --> 1:18:10.750
Everything she wishes under the sky

1:18:11.375 --> 1:18:12.541
must be hers.

1:18:13.166 --> 1:18:15.041
Money should never be a hindrance to that.

1:18:16.166 --> 1:18:20.250
Doctor, Collector, Engineer,
let her become whatever she wishes for.

1:18:20.583 --> 1:18:22.500
No matter how much it costs.
I'll take care of it.

1:18:23.666 --> 1:18:25.250
She must live the life she wants.

1:18:27.833 --> 1:18:30.958
You talk as if our fathers run a bank.

1:18:32.208 --> 1:18:34.375
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

1:18:56.708 --> 1:18:58.166
Missing your dad's cooking?

1:18:58.250 --> 1:19:01.625
Not just Dad's cooking,
but I miss Dad, Lakshmi, and home.

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:04.250
You are so emotional here,

1:19:04.583 --> 1:19:06.750
but at home,
you dominate your dad. Why is that?

1:19:06.833 --> 1:19:08.500
Miss, he likes it.

1:19:09.416 --> 1:19:12.000
When I scold him
or teach him something,

1:19:12.083 --> 1:19:15.500
he feels so proud
that his daughter knows everything.

1:19:26.166 --> 1:19:27.375
Where is he looking at?

1:19:34.708 --> 1:19:36.958
Forget 500,000, just pay me 400,000.

1:19:37.333 --> 1:19:38.916
I'll help you find your dustbin.

1:19:40.125 --> 1:19:42.416
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm also Police.

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:44.125
Ask anyone here.

1:19:47.291 --> 1:19:48.666
Fine, pay me 300,000.
I'll get it done.

1:19:53.708 --> 1:19:56.125
Are you going to tell on me?

1:19:57.708 --> 1:19:58.583
I'll break your neck.

1:20:00.875 --> 1:20:02.000
The third time you made that noise,

1:20:02.500 --> 1:20:04.166
it didn't sound like a cat's meow.

1:20:23.291 --> 1:20:24.125
Niranjan!

1:20:25.208 --> 1:20:26.708
-What are you doing here?
-Sir!

1:20:27.166 --> 1:20:28.375
What are you doing here, sir?

1:20:28.958 --> 1:20:29.958
Maharaja's case.

1:20:30.166 --> 1:20:31.291
I'm here for Illayaraja's case.

1:21:02.875 --> 1:21:04.791
-Tell me, dear.
-Got the necklace?

1:21:05.041 --> 1:21:06.541
I'm at the shop. I'll collect it now.

1:21:06.625 --> 1:21:08.708
Do check the weight.
Don't let them cheat you.

1:21:08.791 --> 1:21:11.083
It's a reputed shop. They won't.

1:21:11.458 --> 1:21:13.208
-Happy birthday, Ammu.
-Listen,

1:21:13.291 --> 1:21:15.000
-Bye.
-did you buy the things for the ritual?

1:21:15.083 --> 1:21:17.166
-I'll buy them on my way.
-Okay.

1:21:17.375 --> 1:21:18.458
I'm forgetting something.

1:21:18.541 --> 1:21:20.166
I had given my blouse for stitching.

1:21:20.375 --> 1:21:22.625
Along with the ready-made one,
collect that as well.

1:21:22.708 --> 1:21:24.708
-Okay.
-Also,

1:21:24.875 --> 1:21:26.250
we're expecting many guests, dear.

1:21:26.458 --> 1:21:29.250
So, go to a good salon
and shave your beard.

1:21:29.500 --> 1:21:31.500
I'll look bad without the beard.

1:21:31.875 --> 1:21:33.083
-At least trim it.
-Ma'am.

1:21:33.166 --> 1:21:34.125
-Ma'am!
-Yes?

1:21:34.375 --> 1:21:36.875
-I'll talk to you later. Bye.
-Okay.

1:21:37.541 --> 1:21:39.458
-Yes, what is it?
-Where do we place these benches?

1:21:55.333 --> 1:21:57.083
Everybody, listen up.

1:21:57.166 --> 1:21:59.791
Today is my daughter's birthday.
We have a function at our home.

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.791
So, don't cook or eat outside.

1:22:03.208 --> 1:22:05.291
-Ms. Jaya, especially you.
-Yes.

1:22:05.583 --> 1:22:07.166
Be at my house in half an hour.

1:22:07.291 --> 1:22:09.208
-Or else, no more ties with you.
-Okay.

1:22:09.416 --> 1:22:11.500
Shall we get ready
before your dad arrives?

1:22:52.583 --> 1:22:54.666
Hello. Is it delivered?

1:22:55.416 --> 1:22:56.250
No?

1:22:56.333 --> 1:22:58.541
The function is at three o'clock.
When will you deliver?

1:23:02.250 --> 1:23:03.250
Where are you now?

1:23:05.041 --> 1:23:06.458
Keep going straight.

1:23:06.791 --> 1:23:08.750
The house in the
street next to Vetri Medicals.

1:23:09.375 --> 1:23:11.625
-Thanks.
-You can see a decorated house.

1:23:13.166 --> 1:23:14.666
They'll be waiting. Make it fast!

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:20.833
Please come.

1:23:23.750 --> 1:23:25.833
Take care of things here.
I'll go have a tea and come.

1:23:26.750 --> 1:23:27.666
-Shall I join?
-Come.

1:23:27.750 --> 1:23:29.375
-Cutting or shaving, sir?
-Trimming.

1:23:29.625 --> 1:23:30.458
Okay.

1:23:33.041 --> 1:23:34.250
Any function at home, sir?

1:23:37.083 --> 1:23:38.708
Well, I heard you talking on the phone.

1:23:39.708 --> 1:23:40.875
Yes, my child's birthday.

1:23:41.958 --> 1:23:42.916
Son or daughter, sir?

1:23:44.291 --> 1:23:46.125
-Daughter.
-I, too, have a daughter, sir.

1:23:47.125 --> 1:23:47.958
What's her name, sir?

1:23:49.125 --> 1:23:51.708
Will you trim only if I tell you her name,
place, horoscope, and all the details?

1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:53.875
Just mind your business.

1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:55.916
Okay, sir.

1:24:17.500 --> 1:24:18.833
What happened? Battery's dead?

1:24:19.916 --> 1:24:21.916
Yes, sir. I'll trim it with scissors.

1:24:22.541 --> 1:24:24.666
Will you trim one by one?

1:24:26.041 --> 1:24:27.541
Go and buy the battery.

1:24:30.666 --> 1:24:31.625
Please wait. I'll be back, sir.

1:24:45.666 --> 1:24:47.250
-Tell me, Sabari.
-Where are you?

1:24:47.875 --> 1:24:49.416
In a salon. What's the matter?

1:24:50.708 --> 1:24:52.375
Step out. I want to have a word.

1:24:53.041 --> 1:24:54.291
I'm all alone here. Tell me.

1:24:54.625 --> 1:24:56.541
Our robberies are in the newspaper.
Saw it?

1:24:56.708 --> 1:24:58.166
Is it? What's written?

1:24:58.458 --> 1:25:01.791
They have not just written
about our last robbery,

1:25:02.250 --> 1:25:04.500
but they have written about
each and every robbery of ours.

1:25:04.583 --> 1:25:06.125
Wait a minute. Let me check.

1:25:07.208 --> 1:25:08.500
Brother, I need five meters of this wire.

1:25:09.583 --> 1:25:11.166
I'm talking to you. I need this wire.

1:25:11.375 --> 1:25:12.208
Please leave!

1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:14.666
What a jerk.
Shouldn't have come to your shop.

1:25:15.291 --> 1:25:16.583
Not only that,

1:25:16.666 --> 1:25:18.958
but they've also mentioned it as if
it was done by guys from another state.

1:25:20.166 --> 1:25:22.750
How long will the police
keep the case file open?

1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.916
They will obviously try to
frame somebody and close the case.

1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:29.000
Well, Selvam,
if they have got so much detail,

1:25:29.291 --> 1:25:31.708
then don't you think
that by now they know it's us?

1:25:32.041 --> 1:25:34.666
They print such news
so that we'll react and get caught.

1:25:35.083 --> 1:25:37.166
Don't beat yourself
thinking about this. Got it?

1:25:37.541 --> 1:25:39.041
Be on time for the function.

1:25:49.083 --> 1:25:49.916
BURGLARS TARGETING ISOLATED HOMES
THE POLICE ARE ON ALERT

1:26:14.875 --> 1:26:15.791
Just 20 rupees.

1:26:17.375 --> 1:26:18.250
No tips, please.

1:26:33.416 --> 1:26:34.958
Sister, why are you doing these chores?

1:26:35.041 --> 1:26:37.666
-It's okay. You attend to the guests.
-Okay.

1:26:38.416 --> 1:26:39.291
Come, dear.

1:26:40.458 --> 1:26:42.416
-Please serve the juice to everybody.
-Bye.

1:26:42.541 --> 1:26:44.541
-Bye. Okay.
-The glasses are over there.

1:26:44.666 --> 1:26:45.833
Waving bye to her?

1:26:49.166 --> 1:26:50.000
Hey.

1:26:50.500 --> 1:26:51.333
What happened?

1:26:54.708 --> 1:26:57.166
What happened, dear?
Why do you look dull?

1:26:57.708 --> 1:26:59.500
You've been dull
since you arrived home.

1:27:00.500 --> 1:27:03.166
-Are you not feeling well?
-I'm tired after driving for a long time.

1:27:03.250 --> 1:27:06.708
You look so sharp after trimming.
Now sport a smile, come on.

1:27:07.541 --> 1:27:08.416
Smile now.

1:27:08.791 --> 1:27:09.916
Ask your daddy to smile.

1:27:10.333 --> 1:27:13.125
Tell him, "Smile, Daddy."
Come on, let me see that.

1:27:14.041 --> 1:27:14.958
Selvam.

1:27:15.958 --> 1:27:16.791
Selvam.

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:20.833
Here.

1:27:21.875 --> 1:27:22.791
-Come here.
-What happened?

1:27:25.916 --> 1:27:27.791
Sabari, remember our call earlier?

1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:29.875
The guy at the salon heard it.

1:27:31.166 --> 1:27:32.958
Hey, look, your mom's calling.

1:27:33.208 --> 1:27:34.166
Please take him.

1:27:35.916 --> 1:27:38.166
You said you were all alone.
Then how?

1:27:38.500 --> 1:27:40.125
I was alone when you called.

1:27:40.333 --> 1:27:41.708
But after the call, I turned
and saw him standing there.

1:27:45.250 --> 1:27:47.000
Okay, we'll follow him.

1:27:47.458 --> 1:27:48.833
We'll find the right time
and finish him off.

1:27:48.916 --> 1:27:51.208
Should we move the money
and jewels elsewhere?

1:27:51.791 --> 1:27:53.541
Let's split it
and stash it in different places.

1:27:53.750 --> 1:27:54.750
-That'll be safe.
-Dear…

1:27:55.416 --> 1:27:56.333
Dear…

1:27:57.083 --> 1:27:57.916
Where's the necklace?

1:27:58.125 --> 1:28:00.625
-Check in the bag.
-I did, but it's not there.

1:28:00.833 --> 1:28:01.916
-It's not there?
-No.

1:28:02.958 --> 1:28:04.333
Fine, you carry on with the work.

1:28:22.625 --> 1:28:25.750
Leave it. After searching everywhere,
he'll finally come here.

1:28:25.958 --> 1:28:27.583
-We'll give it to him then.
-I feel bad for him.

1:28:27.875 --> 1:28:30.000
He told me his daughter's
birthday function was at 3 p.m.

1:28:30.291 --> 1:28:33.625
If it bothers you so much,
then go and give it to him yourself.

1:28:33.916 --> 1:28:34.833
Okay, boss.

1:28:34.916 --> 1:28:37.666
So you want a day off
today as well, right?

1:28:37.750 --> 1:28:38.625
Poor guy, boss.

1:28:39.500 --> 1:28:40.958
Go. Get lost.

1:28:45.166 --> 1:28:46.041
It's not there.

1:28:46.541 --> 1:28:47.666
-Tell me everywhere you went.
-I was…

1:28:52.208 --> 1:28:53.041
One minute…

1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:55.875
Sabari…

1:28:56.583 --> 1:28:58.125
-Sabari…
-I got work here.

1:28:58.208 --> 1:29:00.041
-Just come!
-Take care of it.

1:29:15.958 --> 1:29:17.750
Selvam, why is the police here?

1:29:20.375 --> 1:29:23.416
Doesn't look like
they are here for us. Be quiet.

1:29:23.500 --> 1:29:25.500
No, they are here for us.

1:29:26.666 --> 1:29:28.166
He ratted us out. Jerk!

1:29:29.625 --> 1:29:32.000
Sabari, leave. Just leave.

1:29:32.750 --> 1:29:35.250
Damn it! You thief!

1:29:35.333 --> 1:29:37.416
How long have we been searching for you?
Finally, gotcha!

1:29:37.500 --> 1:29:38.541
You thief! You rascal!

1:29:38.625 --> 1:29:40.583
You decorate your house
with all the money you stole

1:29:40.666 --> 1:29:41.583
-and you're celebrating here?
-Sir…

1:29:41.916 --> 1:29:43.875
-Sir.
-Do you take police for fools?

1:29:44.375 --> 1:29:45.458
Understood our power now?

1:29:46.458 --> 1:29:48.250
-Arrest him! Walk!
-Sir…

1:29:48.833 --> 1:29:51.458
-Please move.
-Stop acting innocent!

1:29:52.375 --> 1:29:53.416
Leave! Move!

1:29:53.500 --> 1:29:56.291
-Don't come near! Move!
-Hands off him!

1:29:56.375 --> 1:29:58.291
-I said, hands off him!
-Walk!

1:29:58.625 --> 1:30:00.291
Stop! Stop it!

1:30:00.625 --> 1:30:02.875
I said stop it,
and you're manhandling my husband?

1:30:02.958 --> 1:30:06.875
He widowed, raped, and killed many women!

1:30:06.958 --> 1:30:09.208
-You live with him without knowing that?
-Who told you all this?

1:30:09.291 --> 1:30:10.791
Are you shocked by just this?

1:30:10.875 --> 1:30:13.208
A few days ago,
your husband and that fellow

1:30:13.291 --> 1:30:15.250
burned a woman and her daughter alive.

1:30:15.458 --> 1:30:16.333
Do you know all that?

1:30:16.500 --> 1:30:18.083
Rascal, tell her!

1:30:18.333 --> 1:30:19.166
Tell her!

1:30:19.291 --> 1:30:22.250
-I said, tell her! You heard me!
-Stop hitting him.

1:30:22.333 --> 1:30:24.833
Let me talk to him.
Dear, what is he blabbing?

1:30:24.916 --> 1:30:25.833
-Is he your "dear"?
-Does the police have the

1:30:25.916 --> 1:30:26.875
-He is a murderer!
-license to say anything?

1:30:27.083 --> 1:30:29.041
How dare he accuse you?

1:30:29.208 --> 1:30:30.416
Tell him you're innocent.

1:30:30.625 --> 1:30:32.833
Don't I know about my darling?

1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:34.833
You're a nice man,
and you run a shop, right?

1:30:34.916 --> 1:30:35.958
-Tell me.
-What are you guys doing there?

1:30:36.041 --> 1:30:37.416
-Aren't they framing you
-Let's smash both

1:30:37.500 --> 1:30:39.750
-instead of finding the real culprit?
-these culprits today.

1:30:39.916 --> 1:30:42.333
-Tell them you're innocent, dear.
-Say it, if you can!

1:30:42.500 --> 1:30:44.208
-Say it, dear.
-Hey, move aside!

1:30:44.291 --> 1:30:45.333
-Tell them you're innocent.
-Move!

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:49.083
-Tell them you're innocent.
-Don't let him escape! Catch him!

1:30:49.166 --> 1:30:50.000
Hey, Sabari!

1:30:50.416 --> 1:30:51.291
Oh, God!

1:30:51.750 --> 1:30:55.208
-No! Put the gun down!
-Sabari, what did you just do?

1:30:55.291 --> 1:30:58.708
Put the gun down.
You're again making a mistake!

1:30:58.791 --> 1:30:59.875
-Don't come near me!
-Put the gun down!

1:30:59.958 --> 1:31:02.000
-Selvam, run!
-Sabari, listen to me. No!

1:31:02.083 --> 1:31:04.750
-You run! I'll manage them.
-No, Sabari.

1:31:05.125 --> 1:31:06.333
Sabari, we are caught!
We'll handle it later.

1:31:06.416 --> 1:31:07.625
-I'll shoot you if you come near me.
-Sabari…

1:31:07.708 --> 1:31:08.666
-Put the gun down!
-Sabari…

1:31:09.500 --> 1:31:12.500
Hey, his gun might be loaded.
Everyone, move aside.

1:31:12.583 --> 1:31:14.541
-Move aside, man! Move!
-Sabari, no.

1:31:14.625 --> 1:31:15.916
-Surrender the gun.
-Leave!

1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:16.833
-Listen to me!
-Sabari.

1:31:16.916 --> 1:31:18.916
-I'll kill you all! Selvam, I got this!
-Sabari, no! Surrender the gun.

1:31:19.375 --> 1:31:20.208
Hey!

1:31:20.291 --> 1:31:22.375
-Kokhila, I'll explain it to you later.
-Hey, listen to me.

1:31:22.458 --> 1:31:23.541
-Selvam, you escape!
-Just surrender the gun.

1:31:23.625 --> 1:31:24.708
Listen to me.
This is for your own good.

1:31:25.458 --> 1:31:26.583
You better put the gun down.

1:31:26.666 --> 1:31:27.916
-I'll shoot!
-Listen to me…

1:31:38.208 --> 1:31:39.041
Sabari!

1:31:40.125 --> 1:31:41.500
Hey, Sab…

1:31:42.291 --> 1:31:43.625
Hey, Sabari?

1:31:44.625 --> 1:31:45.458
Sabari?

1:31:46.541 --> 1:31:47.416
Sabari!

1:31:47.666 --> 1:31:50.000
No! Sabari…

1:31:50.708 --> 1:31:51.541
Sabari…

1:31:55.125 --> 1:31:55.958
Kokhila…

1:32:00.541 --> 1:32:01.375
Walk!

1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:04.750
Daddy!

1:32:07.125 --> 1:32:09.541
-Daddy!
-Sir.

1:32:09.625 --> 1:32:10.458
Ammu.

1:32:11.625 --> 1:32:12.500
-Ammu!
-Hey!

1:32:12.916 --> 1:32:15.000
-Sir, let me talk to my daughter once.
-Mummy!

1:32:15.083 --> 1:32:16.750
-No! No!
-One last time, sir.

1:32:16.833 --> 1:32:18.541
-No way!
-Just once, sir.

1:32:18.666 --> 1:32:20.416
-Ammu!
-I won't give you my child.

1:32:21.083 --> 1:32:22.166
Ammu…

1:32:22.541 --> 1:32:26.333
He must not even lay a finger on my child.
Take him away! Arrest him.

1:32:26.958 --> 1:32:29.583
I cut ties with my family
and married you.

1:32:29.958 --> 1:32:33.250
How could you cheat me?
I curse you!

1:32:33.583 --> 1:32:35.625
-You've insulted me in front of the world.
-Ammu…

1:32:35.916 --> 1:32:37.625
-My life is ruined! Where will I go now?
-Ammu…

1:32:37.750 --> 1:32:39.625
-Daddy.
-The only thing I can do is end my life.

1:32:40.416 --> 1:32:43.708
Don't show up even if I die.
Don't come to my funeral either!

1:32:45.083 --> 1:32:47.750
-Take him away, sir.
-Enough of your drama! Walk!

1:32:49.125 --> 1:32:50.375
Daddy!

1:32:50.583 --> 1:32:53.583
Don't cry, dear. Take him away.

1:32:53.666 --> 1:32:54.708
All of you move.

1:32:56.083 --> 1:32:58.541
-Did you take the police for fools?
-Move!

1:33:00.541 --> 1:33:01.416
Move!

1:33:02.375 --> 1:33:03.291
Walk!

1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:12.583
Don't cry, dear.

1:33:18.541 --> 1:33:19.541
Did you take all your belongings?

1:33:21.041 --> 1:33:22.041
Get in, let's go.

1:33:23.333 --> 1:33:25.666
What are you discussing there?
It's getting late. Let's go.

1:33:25.750 --> 1:33:28.250
Dad, we are heading back.
I'll reach home tonight.

1:33:28.791 --> 1:33:33.375
My new shoes got torn
while I was jogging this morning.

1:33:33.625 --> 1:33:35.208
Buy me the same red-colored new pair.

1:33:35.291 --> 1:33:36.500
I have practice tomorrow on the ground.

1:33:36.833 --> 1:33:39.625
I've sent you the photo.
Don't forget to buy it, okay?

1:33:40.666 --> 1:33:41.541
DAD

1:33:47.791 --> 1:33:49.291
Buy me the same red-colored new pair.

1:33:49.375 --> 1:33:50.583
I have practice tomorrow on the ground.

1:33:51.125 --> 1:33:53.166
I've sent you the photo.
Don't forget to buy it, okay?

1:33:53.250 --> 1:33:54.083
So…

1:33:55.291 --> 1:33:56.833
Looks like they found the culprit.

1:33:57.291 --> 1:33:59.958
-You'll get the dustbin tomorrow.
-Thank you, sir.

1:34:00.500 --> 1:34:01.750
Do you think I was waiting
for your thanks?

1:34:07.666 --> 1:34:08.625
Nallasivam, check it properly.

1:34:11.375 --> 1:34:12.875
-Here.
-Rushing things is never good.

1:34:13.541 --> 1:34:14.375
Touch and feel it.

1:34:14.625 --> 1:34:17.875
-It's as smooth as a young girl's skin.
-You and your comparisons!

1:34:18.791 --> 1:34:20.000
How is it, sir?

1:34:20.458 --> 1:34:22.500
-It looks exactly like that one.
-Yes, it does.

1:34:22.583 --> 1:34:26.166
-Yes, sir. It wasn't an easy task--
-Nallasivam, you're a skilled worker.

1:34:26.250 --> 1:34:27.166
-Thanks, sir.
-Sir!

1:34:27.333 --> 1:34:29.208
You're good at wasting time, too.

1:34:31.333 --> 1:34:34.166
Now, dent it and make it dirty,
exactly like in this photo.

1:34:34.583 --> 1:34:35.416
Consider it done, sir.

1:34:41.083 --> 1:34:42.541
-Give me that.
-Here.

1:34:43.958 --> 1:34:45.416
Look carefully. This is the spot.

1:34:46.166 --> 1:34:47.000
This spot.

1:35:06.791 --> 1:35:08.166
Rub it nicely.

1:35:10.583 --> 1:35:11.875
Sir, he has done it. Look.

1:35:11.958 --> 1:35:12.791
Here.

1:35:15.541 --> 1:35:17.041
-Nallasivam, you beauty!
-Sir.

1:35:17.333 --> 1:35:18.875
You've made it look exactly the same!

1:35:19.083 --> 1:35:20.458
You've proved
that you're indeed a skilled worker.

1:35:20.541 --> 1:35:23.458
Apply holy ash and vermilion,
and it'll be ready.

1:35:23.541 --> 1:35:25.750
-Superb!
-Sir, I have a doubt.

1:35:26.208 --> 1:35:29.250
What if he finds out
this is a duplicate dustbin?

1:35:30.125 --> 1:35:32.375
Let him find out!
That's what we want.

1:35:32.708 --> 1:35:33.958
-I don't get it.
-Look,

1:35:34.041 --> 1:35:35.916
if he's really looking for the dustbin,

1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.166
then he'll accept this,
pay us the balance, and leave.

1:35:38.250 --> 1:35:40.333
But if there's something big behind this,

1:35:40.416 --> 1:35:43.791
he'll ask us who stole it,
where it was, and other details.

1:35:43.875 --> 1:35:45.666
We'll point to some accused and end it.

1:35:45.750 --> 1:35:47.958
Sir, he will pay
the remaining balance to us

1:35:48.333 --> 1:35:50.416
and follow the accused we showed him,
believing he's the real thief.

1:35:51.208 --> 1:35:53.500
He'll fall into the trap,
and we'll know what's inside it.

1:35:53.583 --> 1:35:57.416
-Correct! Spot on, Nallasivam.
-Sir, this is like taking the long route.

1:35:57.500 --> 1:35:59.041
-Do you have a better idea?
-No, sir.

1:35:59.125 --> 1:36:00.833
No, right?
Then, shut up and follow my orders.

1:36:01.250 --> 1:36:02.625
Okay, sir. As you wish.

1:36:21.750 --> 1:36:22.583
Enough.

1:36:23.583 --> 1:36:25.333
-Keep it here.
-Okay.

1:36:30.083 --> 1:36:32.750
-Tell me, sir.
-Can you turn yourself in for stealing?

1:36:33.666 --> 1:36:36.333
For stealing what, sir?
If you want, I'll steal it for real.

1:36:36.416 --> 1:36:38.041
We've got back the stolen item.

1:36:38.125 --> 1:36:40.000
You just turn yourself in.
I'll handle the rest.

1:36:40.083 --> 1:36:42.083
Okay, sir. What's the stolen item?

1:36:42.458 --> 1:36:45.083
-Nothing but just an ordinary dustbin.
-A dustbin?

1:36:45.166 --> 1:36:47.333
-Yes, a dustbin.
-What was inside it, sir?

1:36:47.416 --> 1:36:49.041
Nothing. Just an empty dustbin.

1:36:49.125 --> 1:36:52.791
Sir, do you think I'm a fool to turn in
for stealing an empty dustbin?

1:36:52.875 --> 1:36:54.416
-Hang up the call, sir!
-Hey…

1:36:55.041 --> 1:36:56.500
Kumar, where are you?

1:36:56.583 --> 1:36:58.875
Sir, it's me, Kumar's wife.

1:36:58.958 --> 1:37:01.000
Is he not home?
I need a favor from him.

1:37:01.291 --> 1:37:05.041
Last week, Inspector Pallavaram
needed a favor, and now he's in prison.

1:37:05.500 --> 1:37:08.208
Let him come out, sir.
I'll tell him that you need a favor.

1:37:08.291 --> 1:37:10.791
-Don't worry. He'll do it, sir.
-Okay.

1:37:11.083 --> 1:37:13.541
Rajamanickam, Inspector Varadhan here.

1:37:13.625 --> 1:37:15.166
Tell me, sir. Hope you're fine.

1:37:15.250 --> 1:37:17.000
I'm good. How about you?

1:37:17.083 --> 1:37:18.583
-I'm doing great.
-Great.

1:37:18.833 --> 1:37:20.833
-I need your help.
-What help, sir?

1:37:21.208 --> 1:37:23.083
Well, we've got the stolen item back.

1:37:23.541 --> 1:37:25.000
Just turn yourself in for stealing it.

1:37:25.083 --> 1:37:27.416
No worries, sir. I'll take the blame.

1:37:27.875 --> 1:37:29.791
So, what's the item, sir?

1:37:31.291 --> 1:37:32.791
Come in person. I'll show it to you.

1:37:32.875 --> 1:37:34.250
Sir, if you tell me what is it,

1:37:34.333 --> 1:37:36.750
I'll rehearse well and do a neat job.

1:37:37.125 --> 1:37:38.791
Well, it's a…

1:37:40.041 --> 1:37:40.875
It's a dustbin.

1:37:42.333 --> 1:37:43.708
Hello?

1:37:43.958 --> 1:37:46.750
Rajamanickam!
I know you're on the line.

1:37:46.916 --> 1:37:48.625
You! Hey!

1:37:48.791 --> 1:37:52.000
Kuzhanthai, you'll cross that
traffic signal on your way back, right?

1:37:52.291 --> 1:37:53.458
Drop me at that signal.

1:37:53.541 --> 1:37:54.916
I'll take a rickshaw
from there and go home.

1:37:55.666 --> 1:37:56.708
Let's meet the inspector before we leave.

1:37:59.083 --> 1:38:00.875
Is it? Fine, I'll take care of it.

1:38:02.916 --> 1:38:06.250
Sir, now that's a lot of cigarettes.

1:38:06.791 --> 1:38:09.458
Looks like you'll spend
that 700,000 rupees on cigarettes.

1:38:09.541 --> 1:38:12.208
700,000, my foot!
To get that money, we need a thief.

1:38:12.500 --> 1:38:13.500
But what happened?

1:38:13.916 --> 1:38:16.375
I called everyone on this list,
and none of them are ready to come.

1:38:16.625 --> 1:38:18.625
Is it such a shame
to play a dustbin thief?

1:38:18.708 --> 1:38:21.291
Who said it's a shame, sir?
Call Rajamanickam, sir.

1:38:21.375 --> 1:38:24.083
Don't even utter his name.
If I catch hold of him, I'll slap him!

1:38:24.666 --> 1:38:25.625
-Kuzhanthai…
-Sir?

1:38:26.041 --> 1:38:27.666
I don't know what we are going to do,

1:38:27.875 --> 1:38:29.166
but by tomorrow morning, I need a thief.

1:38:29.250 --> 1:38:31.041
Sir, before morning? Impossible.

1:38:31.125 --> 1:38:33.041
Earlier, I said 30,000,
but I'm ready to pay 50,000.

1:38:33.125 --> 1:38:36.166
-Money is fine, but before morning--
-Sir…

1:38:37.416 --> 1:38:39.375
-50,000 rupees, sir?
-Yes.

1:38:39.583 --> 1:38:41.208
Do you know anybody
who can turn themselves in?

1:38:41.291 --> 1:38:42.791
If so, tell us. We'll pay you as well.

1:38:42.875 --> 1:38:45.916
Kuzhanthai, if we get anything
from the dustbin, we'll share that, too.

1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:47.291
Sir, that's too much.

1:38:47.375 --> 1:38:50.125
-It's okay if we can get anyone.
-Sir… Kuzhanthai sir…

1:38:51.583 --> 1:38:54.333
You're going to find a thief
who will turn himself in anyway.

1:38:55.250 --> 1:38:56.500
Why ask me to find someone I know?

1:39:00.166 --> 1:39:01.500
I shall play that part, sir.

1:39:02.875 --> 1:39:03.833
Nallasivam,

1:39:04.500 --> 1:39:05.875
-can you act?
-Sir,

1:39:06.666 --> 1:39:09.458
during childhood,
I acted in school plays.

1:39:09.750 --> 1:39:11.875
Just tell me what I must do, sir.

1:39:12.750 --> 1:39:13.916
-Sir…
-I'll nail it, sir.

1:39:14.208 --> 1:39:16.541
Wait, I have an idea. Hold on.

1:39:17.541 --> 1:39:19.041
Thank God. You're a savior!

1:39:27.666 --> 1:39:28.583
Mom.

1:39:29.291 --> 1:39:30.750
-Okay, bye.
-Bye, ma'am.

1:39:33.500 --> 1:39:35.916
-Hello, tell me, sir.
-Shanmugan,

1:39:36.375 --> 1:39:37.416
is Mr. Dustbin still there?

1:39:37.500 --> 1:39:39.208
He's here more than any of us, sir.

1:39:39.416 --> 1:39:42.458
Ask him to repeat that story,
but don't let him know I'm on the call.

1:39:42.541 --> 1:39:44.708
Sir, please. I can't hear
or bear that story once again.

1:39:44.958 --> 1:39:46.083
Last week,
my child got admitted to a school.

1:39:46.166 --> 1:39:48.541
-Which school?
-CS Public School, sir.

1:39:48.625 --> 1:39:51.375
Hey, that school is so costly.
How are you going to manage it?

1:39:51.458 --> 1:39:53.458
If you want, I'll narrate the story.

1:39:53.541 --> 1:39:56.083
Why don't you try RDE School?

1:39:56.166 --> 1:39:58.500
-Three robbers broke into--
-Listen, wait!

1:39:58.625 --> 1:40:00.625
Except for him,
nobody can narrate it properly.

1:40:00.708 --> 1:40:01.833
It's urgent. Ask him to narrate it.

1:40:04.416 --> 1:40:05.333
Mr. Dustbin,

1:40:06.375 --> 1:40:08.416
where to? Come to my table.

1:40:09.083 --> 1:40:10.166
You heard me. Sit down.

1:40:12.708 --> 1:40:15.375
Look, we can't file a police report
for a missing dustbin.

1:40:15.458 --> 1:40:16.958
I'll at least file a CSR.

1:40:17.250 --> 1:40:20.416
So tell me, in detail, what exactly
happened, and I'll note it down.

1:40:20.708 --> 1:40:23.333
Sir, everybody knows my story.

1:40:23.666 --> 1:40:25.458
I must go home now.
I'll narrate it tomorrow.

1:40:25.833 --> 1:40:27.208
Do you want your dustbin or not?

1:40:27.666 --> 1:40:29.625
If yes, then narrate it now.
Otherwise, you may leave.

1:40:32.250 --> 1:40:33.833
-May I drink some water?
-Yes.

1:40:39.333 --> 1:40:42.333
-Kuzhanthai, record it.
-It's already recording.

1:40:47.291 --> 1:40:48.500
Sir, my name is Maharaja.

1:40:50.125 --> 1:40:51.708
I run a salon in K.K. Nagar.

1:40:52.458 --> 1:40:54.291
I reside at Bharathi Nagar, Pallikaranai.

1:40:54.958 --> 1:40:56.500
On that day, around ten o'clock,

1:40:57.791 --> 1:40:58.791
I closed my shop

1:40:59.625 --> 1:41:01.041
and headed home on my bike.

1:41:01.375 --> 1:41:03.083
I took the usual route.

1:41:04.625 --> 1:41:05.916
I reached home, sir.

1:41:11.083 --> 1:41:11.916
-Bye, ma'am.
-Bye, Jothi.

1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:12.833
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:17.208
I always keep the house key
under a flower vase outside.

1:41:17.791 --> 1:41:19.375
I retrieved the key,

1:41:19.916 --> 1:41:21.291
unlocked the door, and entered the house.

1:41:22.125 --> 1:41:23.625
I switched on the living room light.

1:41:25.666 --> 1:41:26.541
Then…

1:41:28.458 --> 1:41:30.083
I removed the bag
from my shoulder and placed it down.

1:41:37.250 --> 1:41:38.166
Then…

1:41:39.958 --> 1:41:42.958
I went inside the room to change.

1:41:43.208 --> 1:41:44.708
When I was changing…

1:42:10.125 --> 1:42:10.958
Who is it?

1:43:35.500 --> 1:43:36.958
That was unfortunate, Selvam.

1:43:37.791 --> 1:43:39.625
If he had been here when we broke in,

1:43:40.375 --> 1:43:42.375
we could've killed him,
disposed of his body, and left.

1:43:43.291 --> 1:43:44.666
Now, she's an obstacle.

1:43:46.166 --> 1:43:48.500
Damn it. On top of that, she's beautiful.

1:43:53.083 --> 1:43:54.583
What's with that look?

1:43:54.708 --> 1:43:57.250
As if we haven't done it before.

1:43:57.958 --> 1:43:58.791
Don't give me that look.

1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:01.541
My wife has been out of town
for quite a while now.

1:44:03.916 --> 1:44:05.250
Say something, Selvam.

1:44:16.500 --> 1:44:17.666
Do you want the exact same model of shoes?

1:44:18.083 --> 1:44:19.291
How about a different model?

1:44:19.625 --> 1:44:21.958
-I want this exact one.
-The stock has run out.

1:44:22.041 --> 1:44:23.625
My daughter's coming back from her tour.

1:44:24.041 --> 1:44:25.750
She'll be expecting me to have bought it.

1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:27.333
If it's urgent, please wait.

1:44:27.416 --> 1:44:30.375
We have a warehouse three kilometers away.
I'll have my assistant fetch it.

1:45:14.958 --> 1:45:17.916
You said he'd be home by 10:15 p.m.
Why isn't he home yet?

1:45:18.750 --> 1:45:19.708
Bad spying!

1:45:20.416 --> 1:45:23.625
If I was bad at spying, how could I have
been a police informer for seven years?

1:45:24.750 --> 1:45:27.083
Selvam, for a whole month,

1:45:27.250 --> 1:45:28.916
I closely monitored him.

1:45:29.291 --> 1:45:30.166
Let me tell you that!

1:45:30.541 --> 1:45:33.708
Typically, he closes his shop
around 9:30 p.m.,

1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:35.750
heads straight home,

1:45:36.083 --> 1:45:38.083
and should arrive by 10:15 p.m.

1:45:38.500 --> 1:45:40.833
I wonder what happened today.

1:45:41.250 --> 1:45:44.375
Clearly, not every day
is the same, Selvam.

1:45:44.625 --> 1:45:45.458
This girl?

1:45:45.833 --> 1:45:48.083
This brat wasn't in town for a week,

1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:50.708
and now she's home,
complicating things for us.

1:45:51.208 --> 1:45:54.500
Selvam, no matter how long it takes,
let's wait and finish him off.

1:45:54.583 --> 1:45:55.416
What do you say?

1:46:00.041 --> 1:46:01.125
Wait, Dhana!

1:46:01.416 --> 1:46:03.750
-Where are you going?
-Should I wait for him?

1:46:03.833 --> 1:46:06.000
First, let me slit her throat.
Then we'll take care of him.

1:46:06.458 --> 1:46:07.333
Hey.

1:46:08.583 --> 1:46:10.083
Anyway, we're going to kill her.

1:46:10.833 --> 1:46:13.458
Before that, shall I do it again?

1:46:15.250 --> 1:46:16.125
Selvam?

1:46:18.208 --> 1:46:19.041
Hey.

1:46:32.416 --> 1:46:33.750
I lost my senses, sir.

1:46:35.666 --> 1:46:37.375
Those three were so huge,

1:46:40.041 --> 1:46:41.750
I couldn't fight them alone.

1:46:48.375 --> 1:46:49.833
I almost died, sir.

1:46:59.166 --> 1:47:00.708
I almost died, sir.

1:47:06.166 --> 1:47:07.083
They beat me up,

1:47:08.208 --> 1:47:09.708
stole my Lakshmi, and ran off.

1:47:15.916 --> 1:47:16.791
Please, somehow,

1:47:17.500 --> 1:47:19.000
find my Lakshmi, sir.

1:47:27.833 --> 1:47:29.833
Are you done? Move.

1:47:29.958 --> 1:47:30.833
Dhana.

1:47:32.541 --> 1:47:33.416
We'll do it later.

1:47:34.500 --> 1:47:35.416
Let's go.

1:47:35.791 --> 1:47:36.625
What do you mean?

1:47:37.125 --> 1:47:38.875
Weren't you waiting 13 years for this?

1:47:39.500 --> 1:47:42.500
Back in prison,
you desperately wanted to kill him.

1:47:43.583 --> 1:47:45.125
What's stopping you now?
Are you crazy?

1:47:46.125 --> 1:47:47.000
Let's finish her off.

1:47:50.375 --> 1:47:51.208
Let's go.

1:47:52.250 --> 1:47:53.083
Now, come on!

1:48:02.083 --> 1:48:04.666
Look, I have written down
everything you said.

1:48:04.750 --> 1:48:05.708
The office assistant is not here.

1:48:06.375 --> 1:48:07.833
The inspector will come in the morning.

1:48:08.375 --> 1:48:10.666
I'll get his signature as soon
as he arrives and file a CSR.

1:48:10.750 --> 1:48:12.625
-Okay, sir.
-You come and collect it in person.

1:48:16.625 --> 1:48:17.458
Brother…

1:48:17.833 --> 1:48:18.708
Maharaja.

1:48:22.666 --> 1:48:23.750
I am sure of one thing.

1:48:25.250 --> 1:48:26.500
You're not here for the dustbin.

1:48:35.583 --> 1:48:36.458
Lakshmi, sir.

1:48:46.791 --> 1:48:47.750
Nallasivam,

1:48:48.541 --> 1:48:49.666
I hope everything is okay.

1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:52.375
Hey, sir is talking to you.

1:48:53.125 --> 1:48:54.750
I hope you understood everything clearly.

1:48:55.208 --> 1:48:58.166
When you act it out there,
don't repeat exactly what he said.

1:48:58.458 --> 1:49:00.166
Change the story a bit

1:49:00.500 --> 1:49:01.791
so he won't doubt us.

1:49:05.083 --> 1:49:06.208
Now, what's so funny?

1:49:06.708 --> 1:49:07.625
Well, sir,

1:49:08.458 --> 1:49:11.333
acting as a thief who stole a dustbin

1:49:11.750 --> 1:49:14.458
will be very embarrassing.
This is what I was thinking.

1:49:14.916 --> 1:49:18.666
If my friends find out about it,

1:49:18.958 --> 1:49:20.083
-they will tease me--
-Hey!

1:49:20.583 --> 1:49:22.875
One slap and your jaw will be
lying on the floor!

1:49:23.125 --> 1:49:25.708
Rascal! You know me very well.

1:49:27.791 --> 1:49:28.708
Sir,

1:49:29.333 --> 1:49:31.666
why are you getting so angry
over such a silly matter?

1:49:31.750 --> 1:49:32.583
Of course, I will.

1:49:33.166 --> 1:49:36.166
Sir, I never said that I wouldn't do it.

1:49:36.791 --> 1:49:40.333
Well, I am going to play a dustbin thief.

1:49:40.916 --> 1:49:42.333
I was just telling you the consequences.

1:49:43.083 --> 1:49:45.541
Sir, I'll do it. We'll make it work!

1:49:46.041 --> 1:49:46.958
What do you say?

1:49:48.541 --> 1:49:49.375
Wait a moment.

1:49:50.083 --> 1:49:52.708
Let me make a call to my wife, sir.

1:49:53.208 --> 1:49:54.333
-Go ahead.
-Come.

1:49:54.416 --> 1:49:55.583
Oh, come on now, sir.

1:49:56.125 --> 1:49:59.041
I've nobody to call my own.
I'll be a loner even in death.

1:50:00.875 --> 1:50:02.666
For now, with the help of some locals,

1:50:02.750 --> 1:50:06.041
I'm taking up electrical contracts
in major apartments.

1:50:07.333 --> 1:50:08.166
Let's see.

1:50:13.125 --> 1:50:14.708
-Tell me, Nallasivam.
-Selvam,

1:50:15.166 --> 1:50:16.416
we’re caught!

1:50:16.916 --> 1:50:20.333
The salon owner
filed a missing dustbin complaint.

1:50:20.833 --> 1:50:22.250
After running in circles,

1:50:22.416 --> 1:50:24.083
they ended up
calling me to play the thief.

1:50:24.250 --> 1:50:26.541
-They don’t know we’re behind it.
-Okay, fine!

1:50:26.958 --> 1:50:29.666
-Call Dhana. He'll help you.
-His number hasn’t been reachable

1:50:29.750 --> 1:50:30.875
for the past three days.

1:50:30.958 --> 1:50:33.500
I don’t know where he is.
And where the hell are you?

1:50:33.583 --> 1:50:36.041
I came to Salem for some important work.

1:50:36.208 --> 1:50:38.833
We’ll deal with him
once I’m back in Chennai. Don’t panic.

1:50:38.916 --> 1:50:40.041
Don't panic, my foot!

1:50:40.541 --> 1:50:42.250
You postponed the plan to kill him,
and now look!

1:50:42.333 --> 1:50:43.208
Hey.

1:50:43.291 --> 1:50:44.583
I'll be exposed anyway.

1:50:44.833 --> 1:50:46.916
So, I’ll tell them
I’ll come directly tomorrow morning

1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.208
-and escape.
-Don't do that. Listen to me.

1:50:49.291 --> 1:50:51.208
-That will get you caught--
-Leave it! Now, hang up!

1:50:53.875 --> 1:50:54.791
Hang up.

1:50:59.333 --> 1:51:01.166
Nallasivam, done talking to your wife?

1:51:03.333 --> 1:51:05.000
Yes, sir. I spoke to her.

1:51:05.583 --> 1:51:10.041
Just let me know when
and where to come tomorrow.

1:51:10.208 --> 1:51:11.875
I’ll come directly in the morning.

1:51:11.958 --> 1:51:14.708
-See you, sir. See you, Kuzhanthai.
-No need. Stay here.

1:51:16.208 --> 1:51:18.541
Sir, just tell me the time and place,

1:51:18.708 --> 1:51:21.291
and I'll be there on time.
What's the big deal?

1:51:21.375 --> 1:51:23.500
-Why are you--
-Your house is 20 kilometers away.

1:51:23.583 --> 1:51:25.416
Escorting you will be a headache.

1:51:25.500 --> 1:51:26.500
Shut up and sleep here.

1:51:27.791 --> 1:51:31.125
-Kuzhanthai, tell him--
-You heard me! Sleep here.

1:51:32.250 --> 1:51:34.083
-Kuzhanthai, you sleep here as well.
-Sir.

1:51:34.166 --> 1:51:35.666
We’ve got booze.
If you want some, have it.

1:51:35.750 --> 1:51:36.583
What else do you need?

1:51:36.666 --> 1:51:39.375
Have a few drinks
and rehearse for tomorrow.

1:51:39.458 --> 1:51:40.833
-I'll stay, sir.
-Go.

1:51:40.916 --> 1:51:42.916
-What's the big deal?
-Then come along.

1:52:08.916 --> 1:52:09.750
Jothi,

1:52:10.291 --> 1:52:12.208
you warned me, but now
you’ve carelessly left the door open.

1:52:13.125 --> 1:52:15.333
Did you wash your hands
in the plate from which you ate?

1:52:16.375 --> 1:52:18.000
The footwear shop guy made me wait.

1:52:18.625 --> 1:52:20.375
I didn’t get the color you asked for.

1:52:21.375 --> 1:52:22.416
Check this color.

1:52:22.833 --> 1:52:24.208
-See if you like it…
-Dad…

1:52:26.625 --> 1:52:27.500
Dad…

1:52:28.625 --> 1:52:29.708
Oh, my God!

1:52:38.750 --> 1:52:40.958
-Doctor, save my child.
-Maharaja, get up.

1:52:41.041 --> 1:52:42.375
Get up. First, get up.

1:53:06.625 --> 1:53:07.458
Hey.

1:53:11.583 --> 1:53:14.541
Why didn't you inform me?

1:53:15.958 --> 1:53:18.458
My heart aches to see this.

1:53:23.208 --> 1:53:24.083
Hey.

1:53:25.750 --> 1:53:28.291
If I were your age,

1:53:29.750 --> 1:53:33.166
I would find those mongrels,
no matter where they are,

1:53:33.250 --> 1:53:35.583
and stab them to death.

1:53:36.291 --> 1:53:37.583
You’re a waste.

1:53:50.916 --> 1:53:52.208
Fine, shall we sleep?

1:53:55.125 --> 1:53:56.000
Oh, my!

1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:06.916
Dad…

1:54:08.375 --> 1:54:09.916
-Dear?
-Dad…

1:54:10.958 --> 1:54:11.833
Dad…

1:54:13.416 --> 1:54:15.333
Who were they, Dad?

1:54:16.625 --> 1:54:19.208
Why did they do this to me?

1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:23.458
What's my fault, Dad?

1:54:24.416 --> 1:54:25.500
Tell me, Dad.

1:54:28.416 --> 1:54:29.250
Dad…

1:54:33.625 --> 1:54:37.333
You’ve never refused me anything
I’ve ever asked for, right?

1:54:38.875 --> 1:54:41.208
Can you do something for me, Dad?

1:54:42.708 --> 1:54:45.333
I want to meet the one responsible

1:54:46.041 --> 1:54:47.208
for my current plight.

1:54:48.875 --> 1:54:50.833
I want to have a word with him.

1:54:52.458 --> 1:54:54.208
Please take me to him, Dad.

1:54:55.958 --> 1:54:57.875
Will you take me to him, Dad?

1:55:01.916 --> 1:55:03.458
I want to have a word with him.

1:55:05.500 --> 1:55:06.791
Take me to him, Dad.

1:55:12.166 --> 1:55:13.416
-Kuzhanthai…
-Sir?

1:55:13.500 --> 1:55:15.958
Did you give him
all the details about Maharaja?

1:55:16.041 --> 1:55:17.500
Yes, sir. He memorized them.

1:55:17.583 --> 1:55:18.958
Isn't that right? Tell him.

1:55:19.500 --> 1:55:22.083
We might get angry and raise our hands
at you in front of Maharaja.

1:55:22.166 --> 1:55:23.166
Don't mind it.

1:55:23.500 --> 1:55:25.291
Come on, sir.
Nallasivam is one of us.

1:55:25.458 --> 1:55:26.875
He won't mind it.

1:55:34.250 --> 1:55:35.083
Oh, my.

1:55:35.458 --> 1:55:36.291
Nallasivam…

1:55:36.875 --> 1:55:37.791
Hey!

1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:38.875
Get down. Come.

1:55:45.875 --> 1:55:46.750
Walk!

1:55:47.833 --> 1:55:50.250
Maharaja, he's the one
who stole your dustbin.

1:55:51.166 --> 1:55:52.500
There are a lot of valuable things
here to steal.

1:55:52.625 --> 1:55:55.416
I asked him why he stole it,
and he said it was beautiful. Here.

1:55:55.833 --> 1:55:57.250
What was so beautiful about it?

1:55:59.291 --> 1:56:00.333
Check it properly.

1:56:02.375 --> 1:56:04.750
Maharaja, what are you thinking?

1:56:05.166 --> 1:56:06.458
I hope you brought the balance payment.

1:56:07.458 --> 1:56:08.458
I have, sir.

1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:11.125
Go stand over there.

1:56:11.500 --> 1:56:12.375
You come here.

1:56:13.333 --> 1:56:14.208
Act it out.

1:56:16.083 --> 1:56:19.250
Act out the whole robbery scene
that you and your friends committed.

1:56:20.583 --> 1:56:21.625
Why are you quiet?

1:56:26.625 --> 1:56:28.458
So, where are the other two?

1:56:28.541 --> 1:56:31.375
He said they escaped to North India.
We caught him, and we'll catch them, too.

1:56:31.458 --> 1:56:33.708
Sir, everyone is telling
their own stories,

1:56:33.791 --> 1:56:34.958
and you're believing them?

1:56:35.041 --> 1:56:36.833
You act it out. Go ahead.

1:56:42.125 --> 1:56:43.083
Well, somehow,

1:56:43.416 --> 1:56:45.666
we thought we'd find
something valuable here,

1:56:45.916 --> 1:56:47.875
so my friends
and I decided to rob this house.

1:56:50.208 --> 1:56:51.125
From there…

1:56:57.875 --> 1:56:59.625
We broke in through this door.

1:57:01.250 --> 1:57:04.250
What weak construction.
Two blows, and it opened up.

1:57:07.125 --> 1:57:08.875
We found nothing in the kitchen.

1:57:08.958 --> 1:57:10.875
Then, we all headed to the living room.

1:57:12.625 --> 1:57:15.458
We realized there's nothing
valuable here to steal.

1:57:15.708 --> 1:57:18.000
So, realizing
there was nothing worth stealing,

1:57:18.166 --> 1:57:19.541
we decided to leave.

1:57:20.333 --> 1:57:21.208
That's when

1:57:21.791 --> 1:57:24.500
we heard the main door open.

1:57:25.083 --> 1:57:27.791
Out of curiosity,
we hid to find out who was entering.

1:57:28.750 --> 1:57:29.833
It was him, sir.

1:57:30.833 --> 1:57:33.291
He opened the door, came in,
and switched on the light.

1:57:33.541 --> 1:57:36.041
He put the keys aside
and then placed his bag down.

1:57:36.291 --> 1:57:37.750
After he placed his bag down…

1:57:38.208 --> 1:57:40.041
Since he runs a salon,

1:57:40.375 --> 1:57:42.416
I was sure he'd go take a shower.

1:57:42.541 --> 1:57:44.916
We thought we'd escape
when he went for a shower,

1:57:45.500 --> 1:57:47.375
but instead, he started walking toward us.

1:57:47.958 --> 1:57:48.875
He walked toward us.

1:57:49.208 --> 1:57:50.083
Oh, God!

1:57:55.291 --> 1:57:58.916
As he came closer,
we came in here, split up, and hid.

1:58:00.208 --> 1:58:01.125
He came in…

1:58:01.666 --> 1:58:02.500
He came in…

1:58:03.583 --> 1:58:04.583
He started changing.

1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:07.875
I kept looking.

1:58:12.916 --> 1:58:14.000
Just my luck,

1:58:15.166 --> 1:58:16.750
something fell behind me.

1:58:17.125 --> 1:58:18.833
He turned around at once!

1:58:18.916 --> 1:58:21.541
He yelled,
"Who are you? Tell me! Who are you?"

1:58:21.833 --> 1:58:23.666
I got confused, rushed…

1:58:26.291 --> 1:58:27.125
and covered his mouth.

1:58:48.583 --> 1:58:49.500
Dad…

1:58:50.458 --> 1:58:51.583
There were three of them, Dad.

1:58:52.375 --> 1:58:55.541
One of them had a bump on his back.

1:58:58.375 --> 1:58:59.458
Out of nowhere, he bit my hand!

1:59:00.041 --> 1:59:01.833
I immediately slapped him.

1:59:03.250 --> 1:59:04.208
Didn't I?

1:59:06.791 --> 1:59:07.666
Forgive me.

1:59:11.625 --> 1:59:12.666
As soon as you hit me,

1:59:13.125 --> 1:59:15.375
-I fainted and fell on you, right?
-Yes.

1:59:24.625 --> 1:59:26.625
Sorry for hitting you.
Please forgive me.

1:59:26.708 --> 1:59:29.333
There was nothing worth stealing,
so I stole the dustbin.

1:59:29.750 --> 1:59:31.708
Why create such a fuss
over this trivial matter?

1:59:32.375 --> 1:59:33.250
Right?

1:59:34.708 --> 1:59:35.625
Maharaja,

1:59:36.250 --> 1:59:38.625
we found the thief
as well as your dustbin.

1:59:38.916 --> 1:59:40.875
Can you honor
what you promised us? It's getting late.

1:59:46.125 --> 1:59:47.708
I want to talk to him, sir.

1:59:47.958 --> 1:59:48.916
With him?

1:59:50.291 --> 1:59:51.125
Go ahead.

1:59:51.583 --> 1:59:52.458
Come, let's wait outside.

1:59:54.541 --> 1:59:56.291
What do you want to talk about?

1:59:56.458 --> 1:59:57.333
What is it?

1:59:57.625 --> 1:59:58.833
How old are you?

2:00:00.500 --> 2:00:02.000
Fifty… Fifty-four.

2:00:02.083 --> 2:00:03.041
At this age…

2:00:03.583 --> 2:00:06.583
-Isn't that wrong?
-What does age have to do with it?

2:00:06.958 --> 2:00:09.458
It looked beautiful. Isn't that enough?

2:00:09.666 --> 2:00:12.041
Let it go. Okay?

2:00:12.291 --> 2:00:13.125
Just forget it.

2:00:14.916 --> 2:00:16.833
-Don't you think it's wrong?
-Look,

2:00:17.041 --> 2:00:21.333
I had no intentions of breaking in here.

2:00:21.416 --> 2:00:25.250
My friend was insistent
on breaking in here,

2:00:25.416 --> 2:00:27.666
so I tagged along.

2:00:28.208 --> 2:00:29.250
Got it?

2:00:30.583 --> 2:00:31.541
"It hurts…

2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:35.458
Please let go of me. Please!"

2:00:35.583 --> 2:00:37.458
Listen,

2:00:38.041 --> 2:00:40.333
if I wanted to,

2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:42.291
I could have

2:00:43.208 --> 2:00:45.375
crushed that dustbin and thrown it away.

2:00:45.916 --> 2:00:46.833
Did I?

2:00:47.708 --> 2:00:48.541
I didn't.

2:00:48.958 --> 2:00:50.791
I obeyed the inspector

2:00:51.416 --> 2:00:52.750
and returned the dustbin.

2:00:53.625 --> 2:00:58.166
Look, you're here, I'm here,

2:00:58.500 --> 2:01:00.541
and so is the dustbin.

2:01:00.875 --> 2:01:02.916
Do you get what I'm saying?

2:01:03.208 --> 2:01:05.291
Hey, do you understand?

2:01:05.375 --> 2:01:06.250
Hey!

2:01:06.583 --> 2:01:07.958
Threatening him at his own house?
How dare you!

2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:10.041
Well, sir,

2:01:10.458 --> 2:01:12.750
even if I go to prison for this,

2:01:12.833 --> 2:01:14.250
I'll get released
after three months anyway.

2:01:14.333 --> 2:01:16.916
He must know
what I might do to him, right?

2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:17.958
That's what I was explaining.

2:01:18.041 --> 2:01:20.208
-Are you threatening him?
-No, sir. Why would I--

2:01:20.291 --> 2:01:21.166
I'll smash you!

2:01:23.125 --> 2:01:24.000
Maharaja,

2:01:24.541 --> 2:01:25.458
what do you want to do with him?

2:01:31.291 --> 2:01:33.583
-Forgive and let him go.
-What? Forgive and let him go?

2:01:34.208 --> 2:01:35.416
Are you kidding?

2:01:35.833 --> 2:01:37.250
You've spent hundreds of thousands
on this case.

2:01:37.333 --> 2:01:38.750
He even broke your door,

2:01:38.833 --> 2:01:41.125
stole your dustbin, and harmed you.

2:01:41.416 --> 2:01:42.875
Just tell me,
how do you want him punished?

2:01:44.875 --> 2:01:46.000
-Let him go, sir.
-I'll file a police report.

2:01:47.083 --> 2:01:48.916
-Let him go, sir.
-So that's your conclusion?

2:01:50.291 --> 2:01:51.333
Forgive him for everything he did?

2:01:52.041 --> 2:01:54.291
-Yes, sir. Let him go.
-Forgive him for "all" his crimes?

2:01:54.625 --> 2:01:55.500
Sir,

2:01:56.208 --> 2:01:57.208
let him go.

2:01:57.416 --> 2:01:58.583
Even if he had raped your daughter?

2:01:59.083 --> 2:02:00.500
Sir!

2:02:01.166 --> 2:02:02.416
Sir! Sir, what's going on?

2:02:02.958 --> 2:02:04.125
Sir…

2:02:22.166 --> 2:02:23.541
-What? This is shocking!
-Yes, sir.

2:02:23.666 --> 2:02:25.291
-I just can't believe it.
-Nallasivam, sir.

2:02:25.875 --> 2:02:27.416
Sir, please don't.

2:02:27.916 --> 2:02:30.291
Sir, what's going on?
Sir…

2:02:30.500 --> 2:02:32.541
Sir. Inspector, please don't.

2:02:32.875 --> 2:02:34.375
Sir, please don't do this.

2:02:34.458 --> 2:02:36.041
-Here, kill him!
-Sir, please don't.

2:02:36.166 --> 2:02:37.541
-Sir, no. Please.
-Butcher him!

2:02:37.708 --> 2:02:38.666
-Listen to me, sir!
-Slash him!

2:02:38.750 --> 2:02:40.291
-Slash him! Take it!
-Sir! Please, no!

2:02:40.375 --> 2:02:41.333
-Listen to me!
-Hey!

2:02:41.458 --> 2:02:42.458
Come here!

2:02:43.083 --> 2:02:44.291
-Perumal…
-Take it!

2:02:44.375 --> 2:02:46.041
-Please tell him, Perumal.
-Slash him!

2:02:46.291 --> 2:02:47.833
-Either you do it, or I'll do it!
-Perumal, I came here because of you.

2:02:47.916 --> 2:02:49.083
-Do it!
-Perumal, please tell him.

2:02:49.166 --> 2:02:51.166
-Take it!
-Sir, no. Please, no.

2:02:51.250 --> 2:02:52.583
Don't give him the machete, sir!

2:02:52.791 --> 2:02:54.000
Perumal, no. Please tell him.

2:02:54.083 --> 2:02:55.500
Isn't this the guy
with an ear on the back?

2:02:56.166 --> 2:02:59.333
Weren't you looking for him?
One slash and his head must roll!

2:02:59.416 --> 2:03:02.708
No, leave me! Kuzhanthai, please.
At least you tell them.

2:03:02.791 --> 2:03:03.875
Save me, Kuzhanthai.

2:03:05.166 --> 2:03:07.666
You're going to die anyway.
You better die now!

2:03:15.333 --> 2:03:16.750
Please, don't. Sir, no.

2:03:18.375 --> 2:03:19.291
Sir!

2:03:19.916 --> 2:03:22.375
Sir, we gave him the machete,

2:03:22.500 --> 2:03:24.125
what if we land in trouble in the future?

2:03:24.291 --> 2:03:25.416
We'll handle it.

2:03:25.666 --> 2:03:27.416
Would we stay quiet
if this had happened to our daughter?

2:03:28.583 --> 2:03:29.458
-Let him die.
-Yes, sir.

2:03:30.375 --> 2:03:31.208
Brother…

2:03:31.916 --> 2:03:33.833
Please forgive me, brother.

2:03:34.125 --> 2:03:36.500
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
Please forgive me.

2:03:41.375 --> 2:03:42.333
Oh, God!

2:04:00.875 --> 2:04:02.083
Sir!

2:04:02.291 --> 2:04:04.541
Sir! Sir, open the door, please!

2:04:46.958 --> 2:04:47.833
Perumal…

2:04:48.083 --> 2:04:50.500
-Did you find the third guy's whereabouts?
-Yes, sir.

2:05:12.250 --> 2:05:13.125
-Hello.
-Brother!

2:05:13.208 --> 2:05:15.208
Someone's beating us up,
asking for you! Hey!

2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:39.916
Do you remember me?

2:06:41.416 --> 2:06:42.458
Do you remember?

2:06:46.041 --> 2:06:47.541
Fifteen years ago,

2:06:47.833 --> 2:06:49.125
you sent me to prison!

2:06:49.916 --> 2:06:51.083
Do you remember?

2:06:53.875 --> 2:06:55.708
I lost my child because of you!

2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:58.041
I lost my wife!

2:06:59.333 --> 2:07:01.291
My whole life is ruined!

2:07:04.125 --> 2:07:05.291
Tell me, do you remember?

2:07:06.041 --> 2:07:06.916
Or did you forget it?

2:07:07.458 --> 2:07:08.708
Did you forget all that?

2:07:11.125 --> 2:07:13.000
Hey, maybe you've forgotten,

2:07:13.500 --> 2:07:14.833
but I haven't!

2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:16.250
I haven't!

2:07:22.541 --> 2:07:24.583
In prison, all I thought about
was getting revenge on you.

2:07:25.125 --> 2:07:26.416
After you sent me there,

2:07:26.833 --> 2:07:28.666
both you and your daughter
lived a happy life, right?

2:07:29.166 --> 2:07:31.583
Does it hurt now? Does it?

2:07:33.041 --> 2:07:34.458
Does it hurt, you mongrel?!

2:09:06.375 --> 2:09:08.291
I am used to this pain.

2:09:12.083 --> 2:09:13.208
It'll eventually fade away.

2:09:15.458 --> 2:09:16.416
But…

2:09:17.500 --> 2:09:19.541
the pain that I inflicted on you

2:09:20.833 --> 2:09:22.583
will last forever.

2:09:28.708 --> 2:09:31.750
You will cry every time
you think about your daughter's plight.

2:09:32.500 --> 2:09:33.625
And that is what I want.

2:09:35.708 --> 2:09:36.833
That's all I want.

2:09:41.625 --> 2:09:43.375
Why are you quiet?

2:09:44.291 --> 2:09:45.208
Speak.

2:09:45.916 --> 2:09:46.958
Speak.

2:09:54.416 --> 2:09:55.458
Dad…

2:10:01.958 --> 2:10:02.791
Dear…

2:10:04.791 --> 2:10:06.625
You don't have to see him.
Let's go.

2:10:06.708 --> 2:10:08.375
-Dad, leave me.
-Listen to me, dear.

2:10:08.458 --> 2:10:09.583
-I want to have a word with him.
-Teacher,

2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:11.500
-please tell her not to.
-I want to have a word with him.

2:10:11.583 --> 2:10:13.083
-Jothi, listen to your dad.
-Dad, leave me.

2:10:13.166 --> 2:10:14.625
-Dad, leave me.
-No, dear. Let's go.

2:10:14.791 --> 2:10:16.500
-No need. Please listen to me.
-Leave me. Dad!

2:10:16.958 --> 2:10:17.958
I must have a word with him.

2:10:24.041 --> 2:10:25.250
Teacher, please wait here.

2:10:43.041 --> 2:10:44.250
Dad, please wait outside.

2:10:44.833 --> 2:10:45.791
You talk. I'll wait here.

2:10:47.041 --> 2:10:48.416
Just wait outside for a minute.

2:11:03.041 --> 2:11:04.708
Why are you looking at me like that?

2:11:05.333 --> 2:11:08.583
I came here expecting to see
the most despicable person in the world.

2:11:09.500 --> 2:11:10.416
And I'm looking at him.

2:11:19.708 --> 2:11:20.833
You came for this, right?

2:11:22.416 --> 2:11:23.250
Here, take it.

2:11:27.125 --> 2:11:30.500
Don't think you've achieved
something great by doing this to me.

2:11:31.208 --> 2:11:32.291
I won't break down.

2:11:32.666 --> 2:11:34.583
I will move on from this.

2:11:35.250 --> 2:11:37.791
If you have a daughter like me,
then go and ask her

2:11:38.333 --> 2:11:41.083
how many filthy dogs like you
we encounter every day.

2:11:42.250 --> 2:11:44.125
If I had known you'd talk so much,

2:11:45.166 --> 2:11:46.958
I would've killed you back then.

2:11:47.041 --> 2:11:49.666
If I hadn't come here,
my dad would've killed you by now.

2:11:50.708 --> 2:11:52.291
Remember, you didn't show mercy to me.

2:11:52.958 --> 2:11:54.583
I'm showing mercy to you
and sparing your life.

2:11:55.708 --> 2:11:56.541
You may live.

2:11:58.625 --> 2:11:59.541
Dad.

2:12:21.250 --> 2:12:22.333
Wow!

2:12:24.833 --> 2:12:26.750
-Do you like this one?
-I want this one.

2:12:26.833 --> 2:12:28.250
-Shall we buy it?
-Yes.

2:12:28.333 --> 2:12:31.041
One guy came to your house
with his wife and kid.

2:12:40.041 --> 2:12:42.458
On your daughter's birthday,
your husband went to his salon.

2:12:42.750 --> 2:12:44.708
He forgot the necklace there.

2:12:44.916 --> 2:12:47.416
By the time he could return it
to your home, a lot had happened.

2:12:47.583 --> 2:12:49.250
We even went to your house a few times.

2:12:49.666 --> 2:12:50.708
But it was locked.

2:12:51.125 --> 2:12:53.458
We looked everywhere
and finally found you in this house.

2:12:54.875 --> 2:12:55.708
Hey.

2:12:56.125 --> 2:12:56.958
Hand it over.

2:12:59.416 --> 2:13:01.791
Please. I don't want
that piece of jewelry.

2:13:02.166 --> 2:13:07.166
I wonder how many families
he killed and robbed to buy this.

2:13:07.458 --> 2:13:09.291
Please donate it to some temple.

2:13:09.625 --> 2:13:12.666
I wish that even a small gift
my daughter receives

2:13:12.833 --> 2:13:14.458
must come from hard-earned money.

2:13:21.375 --> 2:13:22.250
Hey.

2:13:22.666 --> 2:13:24.666
Go to the shop across the road
and buy her a doll.

2:13:57.166 --> 2:13:58.500
In that accident,

2:13:58.750 --> 2:14:02.083
only one child survived,
and they took her to the hospital.

2:14:02.291 --> 2:14:06.000
But I heard that the kid succumbed
to the injuries and died.

2:14:25.375 --> 2:14:26.291
Ammu!

2:14:27.750 --> 2:14:28.666
Ammu!

2:14:29.583 --> 2:14:31.000
Nothing. Let's leave.

2:14:31.166 --> 2:14:32.000
Come.

2:14:32.083 --> 2:14:32.958
Ammu!

2:14:36.375 --> 2:14:37.416
Ammu!

2:14:38.958 --> 2:14:39.875
Ammu!

2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.166
-Ammu!
-You guys keep walking. I'll be back.

2:14:43.250 --> 2:14:44.416
Ammu!

2:14:48.125 --> 2:14:49.083
Hey…

2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:51.083
That's my daughter, isn't she?

2:14:51.666 --> 2:14:53.750
Isn't she my daughter? Tell me.

2:14:56.791 --> 2:14:57.791
Ammu!

2:14:57.916 --> 2:15:01.083
Oh God! Please forgive me, O my deity!

2:15:01.375 --> 2:15:02.208
Hey…

2:15:02.291 --> 2:15:04.416
She's my daughter, isn't she?
Please tell me!

2:15:04.541 --> 2:15:07.166
Let me talk to her once.
Just once! Please!

2:15:07.250 --> 2:15:08.541
I promise I won't tell her
that I'm her father.

2:15:08.625 --> 2:15:09.541
Ammu!

2:15:09.666 --> 2:15:12.291
Please call her. I beg you.

2:15:12.916 --> 2:15:14.875
Please call her. Please call my daughter.

2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.250
Please call my daughter.
Please!

2:15:35.166 --> 2:15:38.333
Please bring her here.
Let me ask for forgiveness. Call her.

2:15:38.416 --> 2:15:40.875
She's my daughter, isn't she?
Tell me!

2:15:41.166 --> 2:15:42.083
Bring her here.

2:15:46.083 --> 2:15:47.041
She's my daughter.

2:15:47.666 --> 2:15:48.958
Ammu!

2:15:49.708 --> 2:15:50.958
Ammu!

2:15:51.875 --> 2:15:53.208
Ammu!

2:15:53.541 --> 2:15:54.833
Ammu!

2:16:10.500 --> 2:16:11.541
Ammu!

2:16:13.041 --> 2:16:14.666
Ammu…

2:16:18.500 --> 2:16:19.375
Ammu!

2:16:19.666 --> 2:16:20.625
Ammu!

2:16:21.083 --> 2:16:22.916
Ammu…

2:16:36.666 --> 2:16:37.708
Ammu!

2:16:39.250 --> 2:16:40.375
Ammu!

2:16:53.791 --> 2:16:54.875
Ammu!

2:16:56.625 --> 2:16:57.791
Ammu!

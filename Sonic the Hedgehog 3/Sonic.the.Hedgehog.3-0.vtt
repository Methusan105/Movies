WEBVTT

00:01:05.848 --> 00:01:08.764
Oh. yes! You got donuts.

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:10.766
I already ate
all the Boston Cream.

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:12.507
Kyle!

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:20.428
This place gives me the creeps.

00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:24.606
Relax. That Popsicle
hasn't moved in 50 years.

00:01:56.812 --> 00:01:58.161
Is that normal?

00:01:58.335 --> 00:01:59.336
No.

00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:03.993
- Someone's hacking the system.
- What?

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:05.647
The containment tank
is destabilizing.

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:07.518
He's waking up.

00:03:44.963 --> 00:03:46.617
We need more guys.

00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:48.576
That is all the guys.

00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:25.439
Wait a second.

00:04:25.613 --> 00:04:27.397
I thought we were going tubing.

00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:29.704
Hold on. hold on.
Is this a race?

00:04:29.878 --> 00:04:31.358
You're going down!

00:04:31.532 --> 00:04:33.534
It is my destiny
to claim the throne

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.623
of Family Champion. hedgehog.

00:04:35.797 --> 00:04:37.015
Cute.

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:38.452
Are you sure
you want to challenge

00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:40.192
the fastest creature
in the universe?

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.282
I mean. that's kind of
my whole brand.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.414
Okay. Tom and Maddie.

00:04:44.588 --> 00:04:46.242
- count us down.
- Right!

00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:48.549
Don't worry. a little
sibling rivalry is healthy.

00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:50.725
Me and my brothers used to
do this kind of thing all the time.

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:53.336
Tom. your brothers are lunatics and
neither of them were born with the power

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.817
to trigger a global
cataclysmic event.

00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:57.514
That's a fair point.
Did you hear that. boys?

00:04:57.688 --> 00:04:58.994
No cataclysmic events. okay?

00:04:59.168 --> 00:05:00.561
Let's keep this
cataclysmic-less.

00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:02.693
- Ten-four!
- Understood. Lord of the Donuts.

00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:05.566
Then on your marks. get set...

00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:07.263
go!

00:05:08.264 --> 00:05:09.700
And way out in front.

00:05:09.874 --> 00:05:11.572
to the surprise
of absolutely no one.

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:13.661
it's the Blue Blur.
the Red-Shoed Rocket.

00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:16.446
the one. the only...
[Tails] Come on. Sonic!

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.883
Catch up! Yeah!

00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:21.059
What in the what. now?

00:05:21.233 --> 00:05:23.018
I am also defeating you.
hedgehog!

00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:25.194
Seriously?
All right. you know what?

00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:27.109
Time to light the afterburners.

00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:30.460
Look! It's a bird! It's a plane!

00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:32.767
It's Air Hedgehog!

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.349
Yes! I did it! I...

00:05:50.872 --> 00:05:52.090
lost?

00:05:52.264 --> 00:05:54.005
How is that even possible?
I do not lose.

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:56.138
I am also defeating you. hedgehog.

00:05:56.312 --> 00:05:58.880
Okay. okay. I get it. man.
No need to rub it in.

00:05:59.054 --> 00:06:02.971
Come on. Sonic! Catch up! Yeah!

00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:05.495
Wait. what's going on?

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.976
Why are you guys acting like...

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.848
holograms!

00:06:11.022 --> 00:06:12.459
Which means...

00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:15.679
I remain the undefeated
speed champion of all time!

00:06:15.853 --> 00:06:17.768
Yes! And the crowd goes wild!

00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:19.640
But also. what's going on?

00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:26.603
Surprise!

00:06:26.777 --> 00:06:29.214
But wait a sec. you guys...
what is all this?

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.826
"Happy Bea Arthur Day"?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.872
Oh. it's "Happy B-Earth-Day."

00:06:35.046 --> 00:06:37.179
Today's the anniversary of
the day you came to Earth. bud.

00:06:37.353 --> 00:06:39.137
It's your "Earth Day Birthday."

00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:41.009
So the race
was just a distraction.

00:06:41.183 --> 00:06:42.663
which I totally didn't fall for.
by the way...

00:06:42.837 --> 00:06:43.881
Good try. though...

00:06:44.055 --> 00:06:46.014
so you could throw a party
for me?

00:06:46.188 --> 00:06:48.364
Today. we honor you. hedgehog.

00:06:48.538 --> 00:06:51.541
If it wasn't for you. none of us
would be here right now.

00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:53.238
The boys are right. bud.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.718
You know. the day you came
to this planet

00:06:54.892 --> 00:06:56.459
is the day all our lives
changed forever.

00:06:56.633 --> 00:06:57.765
And we became a family.

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:59.593
You stole my hoomans.

00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:03.118
You guys. I don't...
I don't know what to say.

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:06.730
Except... let's party!

00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:08.819
All right![Sonic] Yeah!

00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:11.909
It's now on
till the break of dawn![Tails] Toga! Toga!

00:07:15.086 --> 00:07:17.872
Thanks for the surprise party.
It really means a lot to me.

00:07:18.046 --> 00:07:19.830
Ah. you deserve it. pal.

00:07:20.918 --> 00:07:23.443
No way. Is that...

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.184
What? [Sighing] Dude...

00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:28.448
Could you just for once
walk at my speed?

00:07:33.496 --> 00:07:34.889
Whoa.

00:07:35.063 --> 00:07:36.630
Sonic!

00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:39.459
This is your... Yep. My old cave.

00:07:39.633 --> 00:07:42.897
Oh. man. I can't believe this is
where you lived all those years.

00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:46.466
Hey! My state-of-the-art
security system!

00:07:48.293 --> 00:07:50.165
Still works.

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:51.906
Hey. bud.

00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:54.474
What's this?

00:07:57.302 --> 00:08:01.176
Wow. You know. I drew that
on my first night on Earth.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.352
I wanted to remember
where I came from.

00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:06.921
I still miss her.

00:08:08.357 --> 00:08:10.620
You think Longclaw
would be proud of me?

00:08:11.578 --> 00:08:13.318
I know she would. pal.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.539
Because even though you lost her
at such a young age.

00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:19.847
you didn't let your pain
change who you are...

00:08:20.717 --> 00:08:21.718
in here.

00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:25.505
Yeah. In my lungs.

00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:28.812
- Or your heart.
- Heart. right.

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:30.597
Yeah. makes more sense.
Not lungs. heart.

00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:32.120
That's the thing
about life. Sonic.

00:08:32.294 --> 00:08:34.992
it's all about the choices
we make.

00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:36.646
You're gonna
make some good ones and.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.257
knowing you.
you're gonna make some bad ones.

00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:40.432
But...

00:08:41.912 --> 00:08:44.480
as long as you remember
to listen to your heart.

00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:46.874
you're gonna make the right
choice when it matters the most.

00:08:47.048 --> 00:08:48.615
Thanks.

00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:50.486
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.837
<i>I'd probably be
a totally different hedgehog.</i>

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.024
2024?

00:09:07.198 --> 00:09:10.550
I've been trapped for 50 years?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.556
- Move. move!
- Take positions!

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.472
Get on the ground now!

00:09:21.822 --> 00:09:23.432
We've got you surrounded!

00:09:24.651 --> 00:09:28.568
Why won't you leave me alone?

00:09:28.742 --> 00:09:29.569
Take him down!

00:09:34.312 --> 00:09:37.141
I have dishonored
my marshmallow.

00:09:37.315 --> 00:09:40.884
It's really just a question
of temperature and distance.

00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:42.799
It's not a competition.

00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:45.715
This is so nice.

00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:48.326
- Peace.
- Quiet.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.632
Finally.

00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:51.547
Finally!

00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:05.561
Hey! We're trying to have
a family moment down here!

00:10:18.356 --> 00:10:20.707
- What did we do?
- Or what did they do?

00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:22.012
What did you do?

00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:23.710
I don't know.
I do a lot of stuff.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.543
Mr. And Mrs. Wachowski.

00:10:32.675 --> 00:10:33.589
Aliens.

00:10:33.763 --> 00:10:35.765
"Aliens"? Excuse me?

00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:37.288
It's not like we're
from different planet...

00:10:37.462 --> 00:10:39.421
Oh. yeah. we are.
I guess we are aliens.

00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:40.640
Please continue.

00:10:40.814 --> 00:10:41.902
I'm Director Rockwell.

00:10:42.076 --> 00:10:43.468
There is a very
dangerous situation

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.862
unfolding right now in Tokyo.

00:10:46.036 --> 00:10:50.040
Commander Walters is requesting
Team Sonic's immediate assistance.

00:10:50.214 --> 00:10:52.695
"Team Sonic"?
Who picked that name?

00:10:52.869 --> 00:10:55.045
Love it!
Ten out of ten. no notes.

00:10:55.219 --> 00:10:57.526
Tom and Maddie.
put the s'mores on ice

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.443
because Team Sonic
is off to save the day!

00:11:08.232 --> 00:11:09.669
Remember.

00:11:09.843 --> 00:11:12.410
make good choices!

00:11:25.902 --> 00:11:28.949
Good evening and welcome
to Tails Air flight 1012.

00:11:29.123 --> 00:11:31.908
We're looking at
an on-time arrival into Tokyo.

00:11:32.082 --> 00:11:34.171
Okay. Captain. we got
a rogue alien on the loose.

00:11:34.345 --> 00:11:35.869
How do we find him?

00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:40.134
Uh. start with
the giant fireball?

00:11:40.308 --> 00:11:42.702
I love it! Let's start
with the giant fireball.

00:11:45.443 --> 00:11:48.098
Finally. some action!

00:11:48.272 --> 00:11:50.144
Okay. time to gear up.

00:11:50.318 --> 00:11:53.974
Titanium handcuffs.
completely indestructible.

00:11:54.148 --> 00:11:56.150
I don't need
your silly gizmos. fox.

00:11:56.324 --> 00:11:58.239
And you know why?
Because I am...

00:11:58.413 --> 00:12:00.197
one million percent muscle.

00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:02.460
Yes. good.
You've been listening.

00:12:02.634 --> 00:12:04.680
We're over the drop zone.

00:12:04.854 --> 00:12:07.335
All right. here we go. Showtime!

00:12:09.946 --> 00:12:11.731
Now. look. we don't know
if it's Godzilla

00:12:11.905 --> 00:12:12.949
or Hello Kitty down there.

00:12:13.123 --> 00:12:14.734
but as long
as we stick together.

00:12:14.908 --> 00:12:16.561
there is nothing
we can't handle.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.433
"Team Sonic" on three.

00:12:18.607 --> 00:12:21.088
One. two. three.

00:12:21.262 --> 00:12:22.480
Team...

00:12:22.654 --> 00:12:23.917
- Sonic!
- Knuckles!

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.618
Talk about low-budget flights.
No food or movies?

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:31.359
We're out of here!

00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:56.645
[Knuckles] What happened here?

00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:58.734
Looks like GUN
got their butts kicked.

00:12:58.908 --> 00:13:01.215
Keep your eyes open.
Tails. anything?

00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:03.913
Whoa! These energy readings
are off the charts!

00:13:06.002 --> 00:13:08.004
Look out!

00:13:09.353 --> 00:13:12.704
One... million... percent.

00:13:25.848 --> 00:13:28.416
Whoa! Are you guys seeing this?

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.158
- He looks just like you.
- Impossible!

00:13:31.332 --> 00:13:32.986
You're a colorful bunch.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.554
Um. excuse me.
Why do you look like me?

00:13:36.728 --> 00:13:38.121
I don't look like you.

00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:41.124
You look like me!
Why do you look like me?

00:13:41.298 --> 00:13:44.998
Hey. you know what? I'll ask
the questions. new hedgehog!

00:13:45.172 --> 00:13:47.174
Who are you?
Why do you look like me?

00:13:47.348 --> 00:13:49.176
This is a waste of time.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.961
Walk away. before you get hurt.

00:13:52.135 --> 00:13:53.745
Whoa. whoa. easy. buddy.

00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:56.792
We don't want to fight you.

00:13:56.966 --> 00:13:59.664
Actually. Sonic.
I would like to fight.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.275
Not now.

00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:03.190
Why don't you stop throwing cars
at us for a second

00:14:03.364 --> 00:14:04.800
and come down here to talk?

00:14:04.974 --> 00:14:07.542
You jumped
out of a GUN helicopter.

00:14:07.716 --> 00:14:09.674
There's nothing to talk about.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.720
All right. then. Enough!

00:14:11.894 --> 00:14:13.113
Knuckles. no!

00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:15.855
Let us talk with our fists!

00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:31.871
Knuckles!

00:14:32.045 --> 00:14:34.221
Knuckles!
Knuckles. are you okay?

00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:35.613
No. not really. Ow!

00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:39.704
Who is this guy?

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.054
He is much more impressive

00:14:41.228 --> 00:14:43.056
than the hedgehog
I fought previously.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.319
Dude. I'm standing right here.

00:14:45.493 --> 00:14:48.888
Now. come on!
He can't take us all at once.

00:14:49.062 --> 00:14:50.846
Ow!

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.422
Okay. he took us all at once.

00:15:01.596 --> 00:15:02.553
Weakling.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.124
Don't try to follow me.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:14.043
Sonic. I know that look.

00:15:14.217 --> 00:15:16.045
Going after him is a bad idea.

00:15:16.219 --> 00:15:18.482
When has that ever stopped me?

00:15:22.095 --> 00:15:24.358
I got to ask.
one hedgehog to another.

00:15:24.532 --> 00:15:25.576
who does your highlights?

00:15:34.411 --> 00:15:37.806
Hey! Dangerously weaving
through traffic is my thing!

00:15:44.378 --> 00:15:45.814
Coming through!

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.299
Why are you running away?
We were just getting started.

00:15:54.475 --> 00:15:55.824
The more you talk.

00:15:55.998 --> 00:15:57.782
the harder I want to hit you.

00:16:01.525 --> 00:16:02.874
Watch out!

00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:06.269
Ugh. I'm gonna throw up!

00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:10.708
Yeah. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

00:16:13.146 --> 00:16:14.277
Yah!

00:16:51.358 --> 00:16:55.231
1.21 gigawatts.

00:16:58.843 --> 00:17:00.976
Oh. you've got to be kidding me!

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.890
Sonic!

00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:03.239
Are you okay?

00:17:03.413 --> 00:17:05.328
I'm fine. guys.
And before you ask.

00:17:05.502 --> 00:17:07.374
I handcuffed myself
for tactical reasons

00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:09.289
that I do not have time
to explain.

00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:11.334
You shouldn't have gone off
on your own.

00:17:11.508 --> 00:17:13.206
We're supposed to be a team.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.599
Sorry. buddy. I'm still
working on this teamwork thing.

00:17:15.773 --> 00:17:17.297
So now what?

00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:19.647
Well. I'm not jumping
out of any more helicopters

00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:21.823
until we get some answers
from GUN.

00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:23.564
We need somewhere to regroup.

00:17:25.087 --> 00:17:26.915
I know just the place.

00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:39.188
<i>Hai. chiizu.</i>

00:17:39.362 --> 00:17:40.624
It's an ambush!

00:17:40.798 --> 00:17:42.800
You'll never take us alive.
foul beasts!

00:17:42.974 --> 00:17:45.325
Calm down. Knuckles.
This is a Chao Garden.

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:48.589
One of the top ten must-see
spots in all of Tokyo!

00:17:48.763 --> 00:17:50.678
It's a perfect place
for us to blend in.

00:17:50.852 --> 00:17:52.506
Are you Detective Pikachu?

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.116
Yes. he is!

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:57.250
He does look like a Pokémon.

00:17:57.424 --> 00:17:58.381
"Pika. pika!"

00:17:58.555 --> 00:18:00.340
Commander Walters!

00:18:00.514 --> 00:18:02.298
Sonic.

00:18:02.472 --> 00:18:05.214
Thank God you're all okay.
I'm sure you have questions.

00:18:05.388 --> 00:18:08.087
Just a big ticked-off
red and black one.

00:18:08.261 --> 00:18:09.653
Who was that guy?

00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:12.526
Shadow's story
began a lot like yours. Sonic.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.485
But where you found family
and friends on this planet.

00:18:15.659 --> 00:18:19.185
Shadow found only pain and loss.

00:18:19.924 --> 00:18:22.275
<i>It begins over 50 years ago.</i>

00:18:22.449 --> 00:18:25.582
<i>with a meteor crash
in a quiet corner of Oklahoma.</i>

00:18:25.756 --> 00:18:29.369
<i>The meteorite contained
a life-form.</i>

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.895
<i>The ultimate life-form.</i>

00:18:35.897 --> 00:18:38.378
<i>Shadow's power...
his "chaos energy"...</i>

00:18:38.552 --> 00:18:41.555
<i>went far beyond
any living creature.</i>

00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:46.734
<i>The scientist who discovered
him believed this power</i>

00:18:46.908 --> 00:18:49.084
<i>would usher in a new era
for humanity.</i>

00:18:50.607 --> 00:18:53.741
<i>But Shadow's power
proved too dangerous.</i>

00:18:56.657 --> 00:18:58.659
<i>A terrible accident
destroyed the lab.</i>

00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:01.096
<i>taking human lives with it.</i>

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:05.535
<i>The project leader was blamed
for the incident and imprisoned.</i>

00:19:05.709 --> 00:19:07.363
<i>With the program canceled...</i>

00:19:07.537 --> 00:19:10.497
<i>Shadow was a loose end
no one knew how to deal with.</i>

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:13.674
<i>Too dangerous
to be walking free.</i>

00:19:13.848 --> 00:19:16.198
<i>too valuable to destroy.</i>

00:19:17.286 --> 00:19:19.462
<i>So I had him placed
into stasis...</i>

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:24.163
<i>indefinitely.</i>

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:29.255
Wait a second. If Shadow's
been on ice for 50 years.

00:19:29.429 --> 00:19:31.692
- someone had to help him escape.
- True.

00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:33.520
But there's only a few people
in the world

00:19:33.694 --> 00:19:35.565
who even know
of Shadow's existence.

00:19:51.668 --> 00:19:54.105
A live show? Yeah!

00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:04.420
Get down!

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.393
Egg drones?

00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:23.265
But Robotnik
is supposed to be dead!

00:20:34.058 --> 00:20:36.322
Konnichi-what?

00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:01.347
I'm sorry. we already had our big
motorcycle chase for the evening.

00:21:06.003 --> 00:21:06.961
Commander Walters!

00:21:08.571 --> 00:21:10.617
Commander Walters. are you okay?

00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:12.793
Sonic...

00:21:15.404 --> 00:21:16.536
take this.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.755
What is it?[Walters] A key...

00:21:19.974 --> 00:21:22.542
to the most powerful weapon
GUN has ever built.

00:21:22.716 --> 00:21:25.240
You're the only one I trust
to keep it safe.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.591
Commander Walters...

00:21:37.426 --> 00:21:38.906
Alpha team. fan out!

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:41.691
Do we have eyes?

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:43.345
Secure the perimeter!

00:21:46.653 --> 00:21:48.002
Medevac is en route.

00:21:51.832 --> 00:21:53.312
His launch key is missing.

00:22:00.536 --> 00:22:02.756
I knew they couldn't be trusted.

00:22:06.803 --> 00:22:08.239
Why are we running from GUN?

00:22:08.414 --> 00:22:09.893
Aren't we on the same team?

00:22:10.067 --> 00:22:11.330
Until we get more information.

00:22:11.504 --> 00:22:13.201
we're not trusting anyone.

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:15.072
- Follow me.
- Get it... off!

00:22:32.786 --> 00:22:34.788
Hold it right there.
Tokyo Drift!

00:22:34.962 --> 00:22:36.355
Who are you?

00:22:39.227 --> 00:22:41.577
It's the Goat Milker!

00:22:41.751 --> 00:22:44.014
"It's the Goat Milker!"

00:22:44.188 --> 00:22:46.234
Relax. I'm not here to fight.

00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:49.455
- Then why are you here?
- And why did you free Shadow?

00:22:49.629 --> 00:22:51.544
Are you kidding?

00:22:51.718 --> 00:22:55.330
The last thing we want is more
super-powered hedgehogs running around.

00:22:55.504 --> 00:22:57.463
The doctor had nothing
to do with it.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.988
And I can prove it.

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:18.005
Please.

00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:19.223
join me in the crab.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.967
<i>And now back to...
"La UÚltima Pasión."</i>

00:23:24.141 --> 00:23:25.839
I have fallen in love
with another.

00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:31.235
But who. Gabriella? Tell me who!

00:23:33.063 --> 00:23:35.196
My twin brother. Pablo?

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:37.851
<i>Pablo!</i>

00:23:39.766 --> 00:23:41.158
!¡Bastardo!

00:23:41.332 --> 00:23:43.726
Buenos días. !¡hermano!

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.032
<i>No!</i>

00:23:47.513 --> 00:23:49.819
Let that be a lesson
to you. Juan.

00:23:49.993 --> 00:23:51.560
Family

00:23:51.734 --> 00:23:54.955
is a field
of emotional claymores

00:23:55.129 --> 00:23:57.348
that leave you abandoned.
betrayed

00:23:59.133 --> 00:24:02.005
and weeping while you eat cake.

00:24:02.179 --> 00:24:04.573
which creates copious amounts
of adipose tissue.

00:24:04.747 --> 00:24:07.750
and what some calloused
individuals refer to as...

00:24:07.924 --> 00:24:10.536
man boobs.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:11.885
Ha.

00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:31.731
Doctor. we have visitors.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.212
Really?

00:24:35.386 --> 00:24:38.085
I thought I was having
an anthropomorphic nightmare.

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:39.739
Where the only person
I could trust in the world

00:24:39.913 --> 00:24:41.436
showed up with
all my worst enemies.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.307
while I was in a bathrobe.

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:45.745
playing congas
on my big. fat belly!

00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:47.181
Sorry. sir.

00:24:47.355 --> 00:24:49.488
I don't believe it.
Eggman's alive?

00:24:49.662 --> 00:24:52.012
And he's never looked worse.

00:24:52.186 --> 00:24:54.493
Well. maybe.

00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:58.540
this is what not giving a damn
what you think I look like looks like.

00:24:58.714 --> 00:25:01.935
Sir. right now we have
an even bigger problem.

00:25:02.109 --> 00:25:03.502
Oh. come on.

00:25:05.634 --> 00:25:07.941
There's an imposter out there
using your technology.

00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:11.422
Imposter.
That's impossi... What?

00:25:11.597 --> 00:25:13.076
No.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:17.298
My sweet mechanized spawn!

00:25:17.472 --> 00:25:21.084
Whomever this party-pooping
posse is looking for

00:25:21.258 --> 00:25:23.565
has stolen my persona

00:25:23.739 --> 00:25:27.090
and the precious babies
from my egg sac.

00:25:27.787 --> 00:25:29.266
Well...

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.836
I'll soon egg-xact my revenge.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.664
You see what I did there?

00:25:35.838 --> 00:25:39.059
It's time for the dramatic
soap-opera twist.

00:25:39.233 --> 00:25:43.367
where this Pablo
reveals his Juan!

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:47.415
By cross-referencing
the precise coordinates

00:25:47.589 --> 00:25:50.331
of each drone's energy spikes.

00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:53.203
I can track my babies

00:25:53.377 --> 00:25:55.989
to the imposter's
base of operations.

00:25:56.163 --> 00:25:57.556
right about...

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:58.557
there!

00:25:58.731 --> 00:26:00.471
Sonic. I hate to say it.

00:26:00.646 --> 00:26:02.822
but I think we're both
after the same person.

00:26:02.996 --> 00:26:05.433
Hold on. hold on. You're
not suggesting we team up

00:26:05.607 --> 00:26:07.914
with Doctor Ro-Butt-Stink.
are you?

00:26:08.088 --> 00:26:09.524
Perhaps the fox is right.

00:26:09.698 --> 00:26:12.571
It could be our only chance
to find this mysterious.

00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:14.137
more impressive hedgehog.

00:26:15.661 --> 00:26:17.706
All right. Egghead.
I hate to say it.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.447
but it looks like
we're partners.

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:22.493
On one condition.

00:26:23.973 --> 00:26:26.541
Dude. you have serious issues.

00:26:26.715 --> 00:26:27.803
Ow!

00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:32.808
Let's...

00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:34.723
do this!

00:27:01.097 --> 00:27:02.316
Suck it in!

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.189
Tinker-tailor?

00:27:06.363 --> 00:27:07.800
I need room.

00:27:07.974 --> 00:27:10.629
Think Elvis. circa 1976.

00:27:10.803 --> 00:27:13.066
But sir. I don't have
the proper materials.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.459
Found some.

00:27:17.984 --> 00:27:19.159
Resourceful.

00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:01.767
Hey! This is a restricted area.

00:28:01.941 --> 00:28:04.204
Oh. it's okay. She's the
professor's granddaughter.

00:28:04.378 --> 00:28:06.510
He takes her everywhere.

00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:09.775
Welcome to the lab. Maria.
I'm Captain Walters.

00:28:09.949 --> 00:28:11.341
Oh. do you know
where my room is?

00:28:11.515 --> 00:28:13.082
Yeah. down the hall
and to the right.

00:28:13.256 --> 00:28:14.780
Make yourself at home.

00:28:14.954 --> 00:28:16.129
But. um.

00:28:16.303 --> 00:28:18.087
let's lose the skates.
okay. kiddo?

00:28:18.261 --> 00:28:19.698
Okay.

00:30:39.925 --> 00:30:41.100
Look out!

00:31:25.013 --> 00:31:26.188
Wow.

00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:28.321
Look at all those stars.

00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:31.977
They're like diamonds.

00:31:33.674 --> 00:31:35.415
My grandfather says

00:31:35.589 --> 00:31:37.243
it can take hundreds of years

00:31:37.417 --> 00:31:39.419
for the light of a star
to reach Earth.

00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:42.030
And by the time you see it.

00:31:42.204 --> 00:31:44.511
the star might not even
exist anymore.

00:31:46.034 --> 00:31:47.514
Isn't that crazy?

00:31:48.994 --> 00:31:50.865
A light shines.

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.998
even though the star is gone.

00:31:54.564 --> 00:31:56.392
Yeah. it does.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.918
I wonder which one
you came from. Shadow.

00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:00.962
I don't know.

00:32:02.094 --> 00:32:04.574
I don't know anything
about my home.

00:32:04.748 --> 00:32:07.142
This is your home. Shadow.

00:32:07.882 --> 00:32:09.014
Earth.

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:17.239
Maria.

00:32:17.892 --> 00:32:19.589
do you think I'm...

00:32:20.547 --> 00:32:21.809
dangerous?

00:32:23.071 --> 00:32:24.899
What are you talking about?

00:32:25.073 --> 00:32:27.641
The way the scientists
look at me.

00:32:27.815 --> 00:32:29.512
I can tell they're afraid.

00:32:29.686 --> 00:32:33.255
Like I'm the horrible thing
from that movie we watched.

00:32:34.343 --> 00:32:35.779
I don't know...

00:32:36.476 --> 00:32:37.956
what I am.

00:32:43.222 --> 00:32:44.788
You're my friend.

00:32:46.138 --> 00:32:48.792
And you can do or be
anything you want.

00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:51.578
Not because of your powers.

00:32:51.752 --> 00:32:55.190
but because of who you are...
in here.

00:32:58.019 --> 00:33:00.195
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

00:33:42.107 --> 00:33:43.804
Professor?

00:33:43.978 --> 00:33:47.025
It's good to see you. Shadow.

00:33:47.199 --> 00:33:49.288
I knew you'd come home.

00:33:49.462 --> 00:33:52.030
I can't get her out of my head.

00:33:52.204 --> 00:33:53.727
The pain...

00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:55.250
It's too much.

00:33:55.424 --> 00:33:58.906
And that is why
we have to punish them.

00:34:03.432 --> 00:34:05.043
Okay. I don't like you
and you don't like me.

00:34:05.217 --> 00:34:07.045
Let's get this
over with quickly.

00:34:07.219 --> 00:34:09.047
Out of my way. dorkupine.

00:34:09.221 --> 00:34:11.310
"Dorkupine"? Really clever.

00:34:17.794 --> 00:34:19.883
This door is six-inch-thick
solid steel

00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:21.842
on a pressurized latch.

00:34:22.016 --> 00:34:24.192
I'll need a moment to calculate
the molecular density

00:34:24.366 --> 00:34:25.976
and invert
the venting mechanics.

00:34:29.632 --> 00:34:30.894
I unlocked it.

00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:34.072
Subtle as always.
fist-for-brains.

00:34:35.334 --> 00:34:37.075
Easy. Shadow.

00:34:37.249 --> 00:34:39.729
Those are the guests
I've been expecting.

00:34:39.903 --> 00:34:42.558
Let's give them a warm welcome.

00:34:46.388 --> 00:34:47.737
Whoa.

00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:49.174
What is this place?

00:34:49.348 --> 00:34:51.306
It looks like a military base.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.308
but nobody's been here
for years.

00:34:53.482 --> 00:34:54.875
I wonder if it's haunted.

00:34:55.049 --> 00:34:57.965
Haunted? Nobody said anything
about being haunted.

00:34:58.139 --> 00:35:01.099
What's the matter?
You afraid of g-g-g-ghosts?

00:35:01.273 --> 00:35:03.362
Nothing scares
an Echidna warrior.

00:35:03.536 --> 00:35:05.929
Uh. yeah. Do you remember
what happened last movie night?

00:35:09.324 --> 00:35:10.760
Let go. let go. let go!

00:35:10.934 --> 00:35:13.633
There is no such thing
as a friendly ghost.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.723
So which way do we go?

00:35:16.897 --> 00:35:20.596
I know! We should split up.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.991
Everyone with hideous. brightly-colored
fur take the left and the middle.

00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:25.775
Stone and I will go right.

00:35:25.949 --> 00:35:27.690
No. no. no. no. no. I'm not
letting you out of my sight.

00:35:27.864 --> 00:35:29.649
Tails. you and Stone go left.

00:35:29.823 --> 00:35:32.913
Knuckles. you take the middle.
Eggman. you and me go right.

00:35:33.087 --> 00:35:35.002
By all means.

00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:36.656
We could use some time together.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.440
To work on your trust issues.

00:35:38.614 --> 00:35:41.443
You know what? You're right.
I should be more trusting.

00:35:41.617 --> 00:35:44.403
I mean. you've only tried
to kill me twice!

00:35:46.448 --> 00:35:48.668
Just a dark. creepy hallway.

00:35:48.842 --> 00:35:50.539
Nothing to be afraid of.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.977
You hear that. ghost?

00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:55.675
You don't frighten me!

00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:02.551
Get... a... grip.

00:36:03.465 --> 00:36:05.206
Boo.

00:36:07.904 --> 00:36:10.603
I'm just gonna
come right out and say this:

00:36:10.777 --> 00:36:13.562
You're adorable. Oh. um. thanks.

00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:17.175
So. what's it like
being Sonic's assistant?

00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:20.656
You have a daily routine?
Paid time off? Benefits?

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:24.007
Oh. I'm not Sonic's assistant.
We're teammates.

00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:26.184
He's the leader.
Knuckles is the muscle.

00:36:26.358 --> 00:36:27.924
and I'm the gadget guy.

00:36:28.098 --> 00:36:29.448
We all have a role to play.

00:36:29.622 --> 00:36:31.363
That's what makes the team
so special!

00:36:31.537 --> 00:36:33.278
That and the fact
we're best friends.

00:36:34.017 --> 00:36:35.323
You are?

00:36:35.497 --> 00:36:37.325
Well. yeah.
Just like you and Eggman. right?

00:36:39.153 --> 00:36:41.199
Uh... Yeah. eh...

00:36:41.373 --> 00:36:43.375
Of course! Yes.

00:36:43.549 --> 00:36:46.421
Me and the doctor.
best of friends.

00:36:47.901 --> 00:36:49.468
That's definitely what we are.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.735
Hmm.

00:37:14.841 --> 00:37:18.410
Whoa. Look at all this stuff.

00:37:18.584 --> 00:37:21.717
This was more than
just a military base or a lab.

00:37:22.283 --> 00:37:23.719
It was a home.

00:37:23.893 --> 00:37:25.460
People lived here.

00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:27.549
He had a family.

00:37:28.289 --> 00:37:30.117
Is that what I smell?

00:37:30.291 --> 00:37:33.381
The stench of domestic harmony?

00:37:33.555 --> 00:37:37.080
You ever wonder what your life
would have been like if you had a family?

00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:38.691
Hmm... No!

00:37:38.865 --> 00:37:40.867
Maybe you wouldn't have gone
full supervillain.

00:37:41.041 --> 00:37:43.870
I have no parents.
no aunts. no uncles.

00:37:44.044 --> 00:37:46.568
And something about my attitude
renders me...

00:37:47.526 --> 00:37:51.660
undesirable
to all possible genders.

00:37:53.532 --> 00:37:55.708
My future is a cul-de-sac!

00:37:56.709 --> 00:37:58.711
The Robotnik name ends...

00:38:00.365 --> 00:38:02.018
<i>avec moi.</i>

00:38:02.192 --> 00:38:04.238
Yes. I know French.

00:38:08.764 --> 00:38:09.852
Whoa.

00:38:10.026 --> 00:38:13.029
Is this where you grew up.
Shadow?

00:38:13.203 --> 00:38:14.988
No wonder you're so mad.

00:38:15.162 --> 00:38:18.034
This place could really use
a beanbag chair

00:38:18.208 --> 00:38:19.514
and some comic books.

00:38:21.037 --> 00:38:22.256
What happened here?

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:26.434
I'm tired
of giving you warnings!

00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:31.700
Where'd you go. hedgehog?

00:38:31.874 --> 00:38:33.746
I wasn't finished
trauma dumping.

00:38:35.574 --> 00:38:38.359
My darlings!

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.668
My eggy weggies!

- Don't you?

00:39:17.398 --> 00:39:18.660
- It's impossible.
- Is it?

00:39:18.834 --> 00:39:19.748
- It couldn't be.
- Couldn't it?

00:39:19.922 --> 00:39:20.706
I'm... Are you?

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.055
Imposter!

00:39:22.229 --> 00:39:24.492
You stole my babies!

00:39:24.666 --> 00:39:27.843
But they know
who their real daddy is...

00:39:28.017 --> 00:39:29.105
drone-napper!

00:39:30.977 --> 00:39:34.067
Magnificent creations. my boy.

00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:36.809
I borrowed them to lure you here

00:39:36.983 --> 00:39:38.985
and reunite our family.

00:39:40.726 --> 00:39:42.380
You see. Ivo...

00:39:44.512 --> 00:39:47.515
I'm your grandfather:

00:39:47.689 --> 00:39:50.126
Gerald Robotnik.

00:39:54.174 --> 00:39:56.872
My... grandfather?

00:39:58.613 --> 00:40:01.486
But how? And why?

00:40:02.269 --> 00:40:04.314
And who did what with whom?

00:40:04.489 --> 00:40:09.407
You hail from an ancestry
of excellence...

00:40:09.581 --> 00:40:12.148
tied directly <i>à moi.</i>

00:40:12.322 --> 00:40:15.238
Yes. I know French.

00:40:17.763 --> 00:40:19.286
You do look like me.

00:40:20.243 --> 00:40:22.202
But fatter. And older.

00:40:23.072 --> 00:40:25.031
And there's that funny smell.

00:40:26.728 --> 00:40:29.557
But the resemblance is uncanny.

00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:32.038
It's as if...

00:40:32.212 --> 00:40:34.301
we're two characters
in a movie

00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:37.043
being played by the same actor.

00:40:37.217 --> 00:40:39.654
- But I need real proof!
- Ivo!

00:40:39.828 --> 00:40:41.134
We have very little time.

00:40:42.657 --> 00:40:44.790
But I could field
a couple of queries.

00:40:44.964 --> 00:40:48.097
Name the most elegant formula
in mathematics.

00:40:48.271 --> 00:40:49.621
Euler's Identity.

00:40:49.795 --> 00:40:52.101
E to the I times pi plus one
equals zilch.

00:40:52.275 --> 00:40:54.103
European capitals
arranged alphabetically

00:40:54.277 --> 00:40:55.540
by the fourth letter.

00:40:55.714 --> 00:40:57.455
Riga. Monaco. Sarajevo. Tirana.

00:40:57.629 --> 00:40:59.413
The speed of light divided
by the speed of sound.

00:40:59.587 --> 00:41:01.633
divided by the speed of
the bus in the movie <i>Speed.</i>

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.898
17.893.33333...

00:41:06.072 --> 00:41:09.510
Rounding up? 17.894 MPH.

00:41:09.684 --> 00:41:12.165
And. for all the marbles...

00:41:12.339 --> 00:41:14.515
Good. I lost mine.

00:41:14.689 --> 00:41:16.735
A rare lung disease.

00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:19.999
and the longest word
in the English dictionary.

00:41:20.652 --> 00:41:22.131
Um...

00:41:22.305 --> 00:41:25.613
Pneumonoultramicroscopic-
silicovolcanoconiosis!

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:30.139
- Pap-pap!
- In the saggy flesh.

00:41:30.313 --> 00:41:32.402
But looking pretty good
for a hundred and ten.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.451
Oh. Grampy-poo!

00:41:40.846 --> 00:41:44.632
Where have you been
my entire life?

00:41:46.547 --> 00:41:48.549
Wait.

00:41:48.723 --> 00:41:50.943
Where have you been...
my entire life?

00:41:51.117 --> 00:41:57.123
Locked in a top-secret
prison for the last 50 years.

00:41:57.297 --> 00:42:00.561
Made it kind of hard
to send Christmas cards.

00:42:00.735 --> 00:42:02.215
Now...

00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:05.958
you're probably wondering
why I brought you here.

00:42:06.132 --> 00:42:07.525
You didn't bring me here!

00:42:07.699 --> 00:42:11.006
I used my unparalleled intellect
to track you down.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:15.097
Per the plan I concocted
with my unparalleled intellect.

00:42:15.271 --> 00:42:17.056
You'll see.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.798
I have the answer to everything.

00:42:21.408 --> 00:42:23.062
Come on. kiddo.

00:42:36.858 --> 00:42:38.817
Oh. no. Oh. no. no.

00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:40.819
Someone tell me
this is some kind of

00:42:40.993 --> 00:42:43.125
concussion-induced nightmare.

00:42:43.299 --> 00:42:45.432
There's two Eggmen now?

00:42:45.606 --> 00:42:47.608
Double your villains.
double your fun!

00:42:47.782 --> 00:42:50.568
Two Robotniks
are way worse than one.

00:42:50.742 --> 00:42:51.743
Chest bump?

00:42:51.917 --> 00:42:52.744
No.

00:42:53.832 --> 00:42:55.921
Stone. why are you tied up?

00:42:56.095 --> 00:42:58.663
Do that on your own time.
You sicken me.

00:42:58.837 --> 00:43:01.230
You must be
the long-lost grandson.

00:43:01.404 --> 00:43:04.277
And you must be
another stinking hedgehog.

00:43:04.451 --> 00:43:06.496
So you're the one
behind all this.

00:43:06.671 --> 00:43:08.890
- The Shadow breakout.
- The attack on Walters.

00:43:09.064 --> 00:43:10.239
That musty old-man smell.

00:43:10.413 --> 00:43:12.372
How dare you insult me

00:43:12.546 --> 00:43:14.200
with your unsolicited
exposition!

00:43:14.374 --> 00:43:16.463
Shadow. get the key.

00:43:16.637 --> 00:43:17.638
Where is it?

00:43:17.812 --> 00:43:19.901
Ha! Good one. Hot Topic.

00:43:20.075 --> 00:43:22.164
Do you really think
we'd be that stupid

00:43:22.338 --> 00:43:24.384
to bring the key right to you?

00:43:24.558 --> 00:43:25.994
Yep. we're that stupid.

00:43:26.168 --> 00:43:28.344
GUN took everything from us.

00:43:28.518 --> 00:43:31.434
And now we are going
to take everything from them.

00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:32.871
With this.

00:43:33.045 --> 00:43:36.701
My masterpiece of malevolence...

00:43:36.875 --> 00:43:39.399
The Eclipse Cannon.

00:43:39.573 --> 00:43:42.663
<i>In exchange for my freedom.</i>

00:43:42.837 --> 00:43:44.970
<i>I gave GUN
the most powerful weapon</i>

00:43:45.144 --> 00:43:47.668
<i>mankind has ever seen.</i>

00:43:47.842 --> 00:43:50.410
<i>capable of delivering
a precision strike</i>

00:43:50.584 --> 00:43:51.977
<i>anywhere on Earth.</i>

00:43:53.413 --> 00:43:54.632
<i>Our first target:</i>

00:43:55.458 --> 00:43:57.112
<i>GUN Headquarters.</i>

00:43:57.286 --> 00:43:59.419
But firing a weapon
that powerful

00:43:59.593 --> 00:44:01.551
could threaten millions
of innocent lives!

00:44:01.726 --> 00:44:03.989
Yeah. tera-bite me.

00:44:04.163 --> 00:44:09.037
This is one of two keys required
to launch the Eclipse Cannon.

00:44:09.211 --> 00:44:11.518
The other is locked
inside GUN headquarters.

00:44:11.692 --> 00:44:13.563
Once we have both.

00:44:13.738 --> 00:44:16.566
I will take rightful control
of my weapon.

00:44:16.741 --> 00:44:18.525
I'm in.

00:44:25.488 --> 00:44:26.968
Holy crab!

00:44:27.142 --> 00:44:28.753
Spacious and crustaceous.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:30.842
Thank you so much

00:44:31.016 --> 00:44:32.670
for inspiring
this little adventure.

00:44:32.844 --> 00:44:35.020
It really worked out for me.

00:44:35.194 --> 00:44:38.153
And you wonder why
I have trust issues!

00:44:39.633 --> 00:44:41.809
Shadow. wait! Don't do this.

00:44:41.983 --> 00:44:43.376
I know you're hurting.

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:46.074
but don't let that change
who you are inside.

00:44:46.248 --> 00:44:50.513
I've spent 50 years
reliving what they did to her.

00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:53.603
This is who I am inside.

00:44:59.609 --> 00:45:03.657
Uh. nice magic marble.
Real scary.

00:45:06.878 --> 00:45:08.880
That actually is real scary!

00:45:10.969 --> 00:45:12.448
It's a mini black hole!

00:45:12.622 --> 00:45:14.973
It's going to suck in
all the matter in this base!

00:45:20.239 --> 00:45:22.154
Fear not. friends.

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:24.722
Even my teeth are muscles!

00:45:30.292 --> 00:45:32.773
Sonic. try to reach
one of my rings!

00:45:32.947 --> 00:45:34.166
Got one.

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.559
Check this out. Trick shot!

00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:41.739
Come on.

00:45:43.001 --> 00:45:44.567
Come on.

00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:46.395
Come on.

00:45:48.006 --> 00:45:49.703
Come on!

00:45:59.104 --> 00:46:01.628
Yeah! Yes!

00:46:05.327 --> 00:46:06.328
Yikes.

00:46:07.634 --> 00:46:09.418
Somebody better call
Google Maps.

00:46:13.335 --> 00:46:17.470
I've spent years trying
to cleanse the cosmos

00:46:17.644 --> 00:46:21.300
of that spiny. blue speed freak.

00:46:21.474 --> 00:46:23.128
And you did it...

00:46:24.651 --> 00:46:26.479
in one afternoon.

00:46:26.653 --> 00:46:30.570
There's nothing we can't
destroy together. my boy.

00:46:30.744 --> 00:46:33.616
Charting route to GUN
Headquarters in London. sirs.

00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:35.880
ETA four hours.

00:46:36.054 --> 00:46:37.359
As the crab flies.

00:46:37.533 --> 00:46:39.884
By all accounts.
we're ahead of schedule.

00:46:40.841 --> 00:46:42.756
We should take this time

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:44.932
to get to know
each other better.

00:46:45.106 --> 00:46:46.847
Wow. What?

00:46:47.587 --> 00:46:48.675
You mean...

00:46:48.849 --> 00:46:52.113
spend some qua-qua-quality time?

00:46:52.287 --> 00:46:57.031
You've waited for this
your whole life.

00:46:57.205 --> 00:47:03.516
How would you choose to spend one
perfect day with your new grand pal?

00:47:57.396 --> 00:48:00.703
Ooh!

00:48:39.525 --> 00:48:40.961
And done!

00:48:41.135 --> 00:48:43.877
- Masterpiece.
- Look at that. - Yay!

00:48:44.051 --> 00:48:47.489
It's really been great
having time to ourselves.

00:48:47.663 --> 00:48:50.101
Right. Absolutely.
I just feel so...

00:48:50.275 --> 00:48:51.667
relaxed. you know? Clearheaded.

00:48:51.841 --> 00:48:54.148
Mmm. look at all these
new interests we found.

00:48:54.322 --> 00:48:56.324
- I know. so many hobbies.
- So many!

00:48:56.498 --> 00:48:59.327
After the action and adventure
of the last few years.

00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:01.721
- well. I could get used to this.
- Same.

00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:09.816
Tom! Maddie!
We need your help on a super...

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:12.819
- Knuckles. do you mind?
- Oh! Excuse me.

00:49:12.993 --> 00:49:14.429
Tom! Maddie! We need your help

00:49:14.603 --> 00:49:16.127
on a super-dangerous
top-secret mission!

00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:17.345
Hmm.

00:49:19.086 --> 00:49:20.740
- Thank God. Yeah. we're in.
- Let's go.

00:49:20.914 --> 00:49:23.134
Really? You're in?
Just like that?

00:49:23.308 --> 00:49:26.050
- Yes. It was getting so boring.
- without you guys here. - Yeah. So...

00:49:26.224 --> 00:49:27.877
No offense... boring. No. none taken.

00:49:28.052 --> 00:49:29.531
I mean. whatever crazy plan
you're cooking up.

00:49:29.705 --> 00:49:31.011
- the answer's yes.
- Yes.

00:49:31.185 --> 00:49:34.145
Great. But first things first:
What is that?

00:49:34.319 --> 00:49:35.798
Oh! This is...

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:37.409
Li'l Tom!

00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:39.063
Isn't he great?

00:49:40.629 --> 00:49:42.849
I told you to get rid of
that. It's very creepy.

00:49:43.023 --> 00:49:44.198
I told him to get rid of you.

00:49:44.372 --> 00:49:45.765
Okay. that's. mmm...

00:49:45.939 --> 00:49:48.159
- crossing a line there.
- You are in so much trouble.

00:49:50.248 --> 00:49:52.990
Okay. this is it.
The belly of the beast.

00:49:53.164 --> 00:49:55.427
GUN Headquarters in London.

00:49:55.601 --> 00:49:58.560
Tom. we're finally gonna
get to see London together.

00:49:58.734 --> 00:50:00.693
Hey. I told you we'd
get there someday. baby.

00:50:00.867 --> 00:50:02.564
Okay. So here's the plan.

00:50:02.738 --> 00:50:04.784
<i>I run in superfast.</i>

00:50:04.958 --> 00:50:06.916
<i>fly over that water. no problem.</i>

00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:08.396
<i>and right when I get to the...</i>

00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:11.443
What just happened?

00:50:11.617 --> 00:50:12.966
Congratulations.

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.142
You just got incinerated
by their energy shield.

00:50:15.316 --> 00:50:18.928
We'll need to shut it down by
planting a USB drive in their server room

00:50:19.103 --> 00:50:21.322
<i>that will give me full control
over it.</i>

00:50:21.496 --> 00:50:23.107
That's what we need you two for.

00:50:23.281 --> 00:50:24.978
Couple of badass spies.
that's what we are.

00:50:25.152 --> 00:50:26.675
Mr. And Mrs. Smith.

00:50:26.849 --> 00:50:28.503
<i>Once we disable the shield.</i>

00:50:28.677 --> 00:50:30.505
<i>you'll face the laser hall.</i>

00:50:32.464 --> 00:50:35.728
<i>These high-density bad boys
will cut you into tiny pieces.</i>

00:50:37.208 --> 00:50:39.732
<i>And cut those pieces
into even tinier pieces!</i>

00:50:39.906 --> 00:50:41.995
Once again...

00:50:42.169 --> 00:50:44.389
Can't we just get Tom Cruise
to do this?[Tails] Nope.

00:50:44.563 --> 00:50:48.175
<i>Because not even he
could break into... the vault.</i>

00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:49.785
<i>Why is it empty in there?</i>

00:50:49.959 --> 00:50:51.396
<i>Because we have no idea</i>

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:53.050
<i>what's on the other side
of that door.</i>

00:50:53.224 --> 00:50:55.704
<i>To prevent the vault from ever
being accessed by a ring.</i>

00:50:55.878 --> 00:50:58.838
<i>all images and schematics have
been wiped from GUN's database.</i>

00:50:59.012 --> 00:51:01.058
So for the last leg
of this heist...

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.278
we're going in blind.

00:51:08.978 --> 00:51:10.197
Sorry.

00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:11.894
Okay. I'm just gonna say it.

00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:14.462
It sounds like this plan would
work a heck of a lot better

00:51:14.636 --> 00:51:18.162
if Sonic used the Master Emerald
to go Golden God mode

00:51:18.336 --> 00:51:19.554
to get the key.

00:51:20.642 --> 00:51:22.166
No way. Maddie.

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.298
The Master Emerald is too
powerful to ever use again.

00:51:24.472 --> 00:51:26.779
We made a promise to each other
to keep it hidden.

00:51:26.953 --> 00:51:29.086
In a location
only Knuckles knows.

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.436
As guardian
of the Master Emerald.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.482
anyone who tries to take
it away for any reason...

00:51:34.656 --> 00:51:36.963
will become a sworn enemy.

00:51:37.137 --> 00:51:38.878
Okay. okay! Sheesh!

00:51:39.052 --> 00:51:40.662
No need to get
all growly on me. buddy.

00:51:40.836 --> 00:51:43.970
You guys are always telling us
to make good choices.

00:51:44.144 --> 00:51:45.885
Well. this is the right choice.

00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:47.626
Okay.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.107
I guess we're going to...

00:52:05.687 --> 00:52:07.515
London. baby!

00:52:10.779 --> 00:52:13.304
GUN Headquarters is right there.

00:52:13.478 --> 00:52:17.438
Let me go in. get the key
and destroy anyone in my way!

00:52:17.612 --> 00:52:19.179
I want revenge.

00:52:19.353 --> 00:52:20.702
Patience. Shadow.

00:52:20.876 --> 00:52:23.140
Just let us handle this...

00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:27.448
and I promise
you'll have revenge

00:52:27.622 --> 00:52:31.365
on a scale you couldn't
possibly imagine.

00:52:31.539 --> 00:52:34.542
Come on. Granddaddy-O.
we've got...

00:52:34.716 --> 00:52:35.761
dirt to do!

00:52:35.935 --> 00:52:37.719
Suits.

00:52:37.893 --> 00:52:38.894
Right here. sir.

00:52:39.939 --> 00:52:41.810
Stone. babysit the hedgehog.

00:52:41.984 --> 00:52:44.422
Keep the crab on a low boil.

00:52:45.597 --> 00:52:47.903
It's time
for more family bonding.

00:52:52.691 --> 00:52:54.171
Come on. Shadow.

00:52:54.345 --> 00:52:58.262
Got fresh avocados in the crab.
We'll make guac.

00:53:00.002 --> 00:53:01.830
Revenge guac!

00:53:09.751 --> 00:53:13.799
Guys. are you ready for me yet?
I've been waiting here all day.

00:53:16.584 --> 00:53:19.413
Sonic.
we literally just started.

00:53:19.587 --> 00:53:21.807
Tom. Maddie.
are you in position and ready?

00:53:21.981 --> 00:53:24.113
- We were born ready.
- Let's do this.

00:53:24.288 --> 00:53:25.506
<i>Knuckles. how about you?</i>

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.813
I have taken my perch
atop the giant clock.

00:53:27.987 --> 00:53:30.642
Now. where is this glass
I'm supposed to break?

00:53:30.816 --> 00:53:32.296
Actually. Knucks. your job

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:34.776
is to "Break Glass
in Case of Emergency."

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:36.474
Understood.

00:53:36.648 --> 00:53:39.868
I will shatter this glass
like the jaw of a vile foe.

00:53:40.042 --> 00:53:41.957
In case of emergency.

00:53:42.131 --> 00:53:44.830
<i>I will pulverize it like
the skull of a loathsome rival!</i>

00:53:45.004 --> 00:53:48.094
Just to be clear. the
"emergency" is the important part.

00:53:48.268 --> 00:53:49.922
The glass will beg for mercy

00:53:50.096 --> 00:53:52.403
under the shadow
of my mighty fist!

00:53:52.577 --> 00:53:54.013
Guys. remember. we're a team.

00:53:54.187 --> 00:53:55.536
- Let's focus.
- Please.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:56.885
<i>You know what? Let's move on.</i>

00:53:57.059 --> 00:53:58.887
All right.
everyone knows what to do.

00:53:59.061 --> 00:54:01.150
Tom and Maddie.
you guys plant the USB drive.

00:54:01.325 --> 00:54:03.849
I'll disable the traps.
Sonic will snag the launch key.

00:54:04.023 --> 00:54:05.764
And Knuckles. you stand by to...

00:54:05.938 --> 00:54:08.288
Break glass in case
of emergency.

00:54:08.462 --> 00:54:09.681
See? He gets it.

00:54:09.855 --> 00:54:11.204
Then we're all set.

00:54:11.378 --> 00:54:12.945
Hologram time.

00:54:14.512 --> 00:54:15.426
You go first.

00:54:17.558 --> 00:54:19.256
Tom. it's me. Rachel!

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.258
Can you believe it?
We're both in London together.

00:54:21.432 --> 00:54:23.216
Have you met your sister?
Try again.

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:24.435
Unless...

00:54:24.609 --> 00:54:26.393
you're not up for this mission.

00:54:26.567 --> 00:54:28.787
Yeah. maybe you want to be back
in Green Hills. baking sourdough.

00:54:28.961 --> 00:54:30.615
- Thomas Michael Wachowski!
- Gah!

00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:32.225
You brought aliens
to my wedding.

00:54:32.399 --> 00:54:34.227
punched out my husband
and buried me in an avalanche.

00:54:34.401 --> 00:54:36.316
Your day of reckoning
is at hand!

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:37.491
Yeah. that's perfect.

00:54:37.665 --> 00:54:40.102
Okay. now for her better half.

00:54:41.887 --> 00:54:46.674
Ho-ho. my name is Randall.
and I am too much to handle!

00:54:46.848 --> 00:54:48.502
Welcome to the gun show!

00:54:48.676 --> 00:54:51.723
Baby. would you describe me
as jacked. juiced.

00:54:51.897 --> 00:54:54.116
or shredded?

00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:55.944
I would describe your head
as swollen.

00:54:56.118 --> 00:54:57.294
Let's get to work.

00:55:00.949 --> 00:55:02.603
Agent Randall Handel.

00:55:02.777 --> 00:55:05.432
I'm here to have lunch
with my lovely wife. Rachel.

00:55:05.606 --> 00:55:06.912
I'm sorry. Agent Handel.

00:55:07.086 --> 00:55:09.349
this facility's
currently locked down.

00:55:09.523 --> 00:55:11.133
Command-level clearance only.

00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:13.310
One minute.

00:55:14.267 --> 00:55:16.530
Tails... we have a problem here.

00:55:16.704 --> 00:55:19.577
Wow. they must have tightened
security after Shadow's escape.

00:55:19.751 --> 00:55:21.230
I got this.

00:55:22.275 --> 00:55:23.798
You must be new here.

00:55:23.972 --> 00:55:26.627
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Rachel.

00:55:26.801 --> 00:55:28.194
Rachel Gonnagetyoufired.

00:55:29.413 --> 00:55:31.110
Do you know what GUN stands for?

00:55:31.284 --> 00:55:33.678
Well. 'course. Guardian Units...

00:55:33.852 --> 00:55:36.420
Getting. Ultra. Nasty.

00:55:36.594 --> 00:55:39.074
Do you want me...

00:55:39.248 --> 00:55:41.163
to get ultra nasty?

00:55:42.077 --> 00:55:43.296
Nasty nasty?

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:45.037
- No. ma'am.
- Okay. then.

00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:46.865
Then go ahead and take
those little sad fingers

00:55:47.039 --> 00:55:48.475
and start tippity
type-type-typing!

00:55:48.649 --> 00:55:51.435
Mm-hmm. That's right. go on.

00:55:52.653 --> 00:55:54.046
Sorry for the inconvenience.
ma'am.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.395
Mm-hmm.

00:55:56.178 --> 00:55:58.093
That's what I thought!

00:56:01.314 --> 00:56:03.751
My God. I love being Rachel!

00:56:13.979 --> 00:56:16.155
- Did it work?
- Oh. yeah.

00:56:16.808 --> 00:56:18.505
Oh! Ouch!

00:56:19.724 --> 00:56:22.161
Director Rockwell seeking
access to the server room.

00:56:22.335 --> 00:56:23.554
<i>Just one moment. ma'am.</i>

00:56:24.859 --> 00:56:27.732
Oh. no. No. no. no. no.
It's her. It's the real her!

00:56:27.906 --> 00:56:29.560
- The incident in Colorado?
- We're still assessing.

00:56:29.734 --> 00:56:30.952
What do you mean.
we're still assessing?

00:56:31.126 --> 00:56:32.998
- What do we do?
- Quick. change faces!

00:56:33.172 --> 00:56:34.303
Okay. Did it work?

00:56:34.478 --> 00:56:36.480
Who am I? What's going on?

00:56:36.654 --> 00:56:39.047
Why are you looking at me like
that? What am I doing wrong?

00:56:39.657 --> 00:56:40.962
Ow!

00:56:41.615 --> 00:56:42.747
Aye-aye. Captain!

00:56:46.054 --> 00:56:49.231
"Aye-aye. Captain"?
Who are you. Popeye?

00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:51.146
- I panicked! I was panicking!
- Jeez!

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.496
Get it together!

00:56:56.369 --> 00:56:57.805
Okay. Tails.
what are we looking for?

00:56:57.979 --> 00:57:01.330
<i>The security server is
in the 7th row. 23rd cabinet.</i>

00:57:01.505 --> 00:57:06.074
Are you guys finished yet?
This is taking forever.

00:57:06.248 --> 00:57:08.381
[Sonic] Uh-oh.

00:57:08.555 --> 00:57:10.601
Has the time come
to break the glass?

00:57:10.775 --> 00:57:12.646
Or at least break something?

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.605
All right. hang tight. guys.
Maddie's about to insert the drive.

00:57:15.388 --> 00:57:16.389
Ready?

00:57:16.563 --> 00:57:17.738
<i>Three...</i>

00:57:17.912 --> 00:57:19.044
<i>two...</i>

00:57:19.218 --> 00:57:20.480
<i>one...</i>

00:57:22.047 --> 00:57:23.309
Go.

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:27.531
It didn't work.

00:57:27.705 --> 00:57:28.880
Did you put it in the right way?

00:57:29.054 --> 00:57:31.535
- Try punching it.
- Do not try punching it.

00:57:31.709 --> 00:57:32.797
Oh!

00:57:32.971 --> 00:57:34.755
- Take it out.
- and blow on it. - Yes!

00:57:34.929 --> 00:57:36.801
Oh. come on. Tom.

00:57:36.975 --> 00:57:39.368
<i>There's absolutely no
scientific evidence to support...</i>

00:57:42.415 --> 00:57:43.808
Never mind. It worked!

00:57:43.982 --> 00:57:45.113
Little trick from the '90s.

00:57:45.287 --> 00:57:47.681
I mean. best decade ever. Right?

00:57:47.855 --> 00:57:49.640
I'm shutting down
the outside sensors now.

00:57:49.814 --> 00:57:51.163
Yes! Uh...

00:57:51.337 --> 00:57:53.644
Hold on. Is...

00:57:53.818 --> 00:57:55.428
there supposed to be
another USB drive here?

00:57:55.602 --> 00:57:58.126
One with a giant mustache on it?

00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.565
Oh. no. I've got two heat
signatures en route to the vault.

00:58:01.739 --> 00:58:03.088
Which can only mean...

00:58:09.529 --> 00:58:12.706
The Robotniks
have entered the chat.

00:58:13.707 --> 00:58:14.882
Wait.

00:58:15.056 --> 00:58:16.231
Poppyseed?

00:58:17.885 --> 00:58:19.365
Grand-geezer?

00:58:19.539 --> 00:58:20.975
<i>¿Dónde está?</i>

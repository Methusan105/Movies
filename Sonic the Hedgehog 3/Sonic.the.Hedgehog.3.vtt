WEBVTT

01:05.848 --> 01:08.764
Oh, yes! You got donuts.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.766
I already ate
all the Boston Cream.

01:11.506 --> 01:12.507
Kyle!

01:18.165 --> 01:20.428
This place gives me the creeps.

01:21.603 --> 01:24.606
Relax. That Popsicle
hasn't moved in 50 years.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.161
Is that normal?

01:58.335 --> 01:59.336
No.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.993
- Someone's hacking the system.
- What?

02:04.167 --> 02:05.647
The containment tank
is destabilizing.

02:06.343 --> 02:07.518
He's waking up.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.617
We need more guys.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.576
That is all the guys.

04:23.741 --> 04:25.439
Wait a second.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.397
I thought we were going tubing.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.704
Hold on, hold on.
Is this a race?

04:29.878 --> 04:31.358
You're going down!

04:31.532 --> 04:33.534
It is my destiny
to claim the throne

04:33.708 --> 04:35.623
of Family Champion, hedgehog.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.015
Cute.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.452
Are you sure
you want to challenge

04:38.626 --> 04:40.192
the fastest creature
in the universe?

04:40.367 --> 04:42.282
I mean, that's kind of
my whole brand.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.414
Okay, Tom and Maddie,

04:44.588 --> 04:46.242
- count us down.
- Right!

04:46.416 --> 04:48.549
Don't worry, a little
sibling rivalry is healthy.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.725
Me and my brothers used to
do this kind of thing all the time.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.336
Tom, your brothers are lunatics and
neither of them were born with the power

04:53.510 --> 04:55.817
to trigger a global
cataclysmic event.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.514
That's a fair point.
Did you hear that, boys?

04:57.688 --> 04:58.994
No cataclysmic events, okay?

04:59.168 --> 05:00.561
Let's keep this
cataclysmic-less.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.693
- Ten-four!
- Understood, Lord of the Donuts.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.566
Then on your marks, get set...

05:06.218 --> 05:07.263
go!

05:08.264 --> 05:09.700
And way out in front,

05:09.874 --> 05:11.572
to the surprise
of absolutely no one,

05:11.746 --> 05:13.661
it's the Blue Blur,
the Red-Shoed Rocket,

05:13.835 --> 05:16.446
the one, the only...
[Tails] Come on, Sonic!

05:16.620 --> 05:18.883
Catch up! Yeah!

05:19.841 --> 05:21.059
What in the what, now?

05:21.233 --> 05:23.018
I am also defeating you,
hedgehog!

05:23.192 --> 05:25.194
Seriously?
All right, you know what?

05:25.368 --> 05:27.109
Time to light the afterburners.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.460
Look! It's a bird! It's a plane!

05:30.634 --> 05:32.767
It's Air Hedgehog!

05:46.650 --> 05:49.349
Yes! I did it! I...

05:50.872 --> 05:52.090
lost?

05:52.264 --> 05:54.005
How is that even possible?
I do not lose.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.138
I am also defeating you, hedgehog.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.880
Okay, okay, I get it, man.
No need to rub it in.

05:59.054 --> 06:02.971
Come on, Sonic! Catch up! Yeah!

06:03.145 --> 06:05.495
Wait, what's going on?

06:05.669 --> 06:07.976
Why are you guys acting like...

06:09.760 --> 06:10.848
holograms!

06:11.022 --> 06:12.459
Which means...

06:12.633 --> 06:15.679
I remain the undefeated
speed champion of all time!

06:15.853 --> 06:17.768
Yes! And the crowd goes wild!

06:17.942 --> 06:19.640
But also, what's going on?

06:24.471 --> 06:26.603
Surprise!

06:26.777 --> 06:29.214
But wait a sec, you guys...
what is all this?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.826
"Happy Bea Arthur Day"?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.872
Oh, it's "Happy B-Earth-Day."

06:35.046 --> 06:37.179
Today's the anniversary of
the day you came to Earth, bud.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.137
It's your "Earth Day Birthday."

06:39.311 --> 06:41.009
So the race
was just a distraction,

06:41.183 --> 06:42.663
which I totally didn't fall for,
by the way...

06:42.837 --> 06:43.881
Good try, though...

06:44.055 --> 06:46.014
so you could throw a party
for me?

06:46.188 --> 06:48.364
Today, we honor you, hedgehog.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.541
If it wasn't for you, none of us
would be here right now.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.238
The boys are right, bud.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.718
You know, the day you came
to this planet

06:54.892 --> 06:56.459
is the day all our lives
changed forever.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.765
And we became a family.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.593
You stole my hoomans.

06:59.767 --> 07:03.118
You guys, I don't...
I don't know what to say.

07:03.292 --> 07:06.730
Except... let's party!

07:06.904 --> 07:08.819
All right![Sonic] Yeah!

07:08.993 --> 07:11.909
It's now on
till the break of dawn![Tails] Toga! Toga!

07:15.086 --> 07:17.872
Thanks for the surprise party.
It really means a lot to me.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.830
Ah, you deserve it, pal.

07:20.918 --> 07:23.443
No way. Is that...

07:24.444 --> 07:26.184
What? [Sighing] Dude...

07:26.358 --> 07:28.448
Could you just for once
walk at my speed?

07:33.496 --> 07:34.889
Whoa.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.630
Sonic!

07:36.804 --> 07:39.459
This is your... Yep. My old cave.

07:39.633 --> 07:42.897
Oh, man. I can't believe this is
where you lived all those years.

07:43.071 --> 07:46.466
Hey! My state-of-the-art
security system!

07:48.293 --> 07:50.165
Still works.

07:50.339 --> 07:51.906
Hey, bud.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.474
What's this?

07:57.302 --> 08:01.176
Wow. You know, I drew that
on my first night on Earth.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.352
I wanted to remember
where I came from.

08:05.615 --> 08:06.921
I still miss her.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.620
You think Longclaw
would be proud of me?

08:11.578 --> 08:13.318
I know she would, pal.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.539
Because even though you lost her
at such a young age,

08:16.713 --> 08:19.847
you didn't let your pain
change who you are...

08:20.717 --> 08:21.718
in here.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.505
Yeah. In my lungs.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.812
- Or your heart.
- Heart, right.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.597
Yeah, makes more sense.
Not lungs, heart.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.120
That's the thing
about life, Sonic,

08:32.294 --> 08:34.992
it's all about the choices
we make.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.646
You're gonna
make some good ones and,

08:36.820 --> 08:39.257
knowing you,
you're gonna make some bad ones.

08:39.431 --> 08:40.432
But...

08:41.912 --> 08:44.480
as long as you remember
to listen to your heart,

08:44.654 --> 08:46.874
you're gonna make the right
choice when it matters the most.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.615
Thanks.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.486
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.837
<i>I'd probably be
a totally different hedgehog.</i>

09:05.545 --> 09:07.024
2024?

09:07.198 --> 09:10.550
I've been trapped for 50 years?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.556
- Move, move!
- Take positions!

09:19.080 --> 09:20.472
Get on the ground now!

09:21.822 --> 09:23.432
We've got you surrounded!

09:24.651 --> 09:28.568
Why won't you leave me alone?

09:28.742 --> 09:29.569
Take him down!

09:34.312 --> 09:37.141
I have dishonored
my marshmallow.

09:37.315 --> 09:40.884
It's really just a question
of temperature and distance.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.799
It's not a competition.

09:44.801 --> 09:45.715
This is so nice.

09:45.889 --> 09:48.326
- Peace.
- Quiet.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.632
Finally.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.547
Finally!

10:01.992 --> 10:05.561
Hey! We're trying to have
a family moment down here!

10:18.356 --> 10:20.707
- What did we do?
- Or what did they do?

10:20.881 --> 10:22.012
What did you do?

10:22.186 --> 10:23.710
I don't know.
I do a lot of stuff.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.543
Mr. And Mrs. Wachowski.

10:32.675 --> 10:33.589
Aliens.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.765
"Aliens"? Excuse me?

10:35.939 --> 10:37.288
It's not like we're
from different planet...

10:37.462 --> 10:39.421
Oh, yeah, we are.
I guess we are aliens.

10:39.595 --> 10:40.640
Please continue.

10:40.814 --> 10:41.902
I'm Director Rockwell.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.468
There is a very
dangerous situation

10:43.643 --> 10:45.862
unfolding right now in Tokyo.

10:46.036 --> 10:50.040
Commander Walters is requesting
Team Sonic's immediate assistance.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.695
"Team Sonic"?
Who picked that name?

10:52.869 --> 10:55.045
Love it!
Ten out of ten, no notes.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.526
Tom and Maddie,
put the s'mores on ice

10:57.700 --> 11:01.443
because Team Sonic
is off to save the day!

11:08.232 --> 11:09.669
Remember,

11:09.843 --> 11:12.410
make good choices!

11:25.902 --> 11:28.949
Good evening and welcome
to Tails Air flight 1012.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.908
We're looking at
an on-time arrival into Tokyo.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.171
Okay, Captain, we got
a rogue alien on the loose.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.869
How do we find him?

11:38.132 --> 11:40.134
Uh, start with
the giant fireball?

11:40.308 --> 11:42.702
I love it! Let's start
with the giant fireball.

11:45.443 --> 11:48.098
Finally, some action!

11:48.272 --> 11:50.144
Okay, time to gear up.

11:50.318 --> 11:53.974
Titanium handcuffs,
completely indestructible.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.150
I don't need
your silly gizmos, fox.

11:56.324 --> 11:58.239
And you know why?
Because I am...

11:58.413 --> 12:00.197
one million percent muscle.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.460
Yes, good.
You've been listening.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.680
We're over the drop zone.

12:04.854 --> 12:07.335
All right, here we go. Showtime!

12:09.946 --> 12:11.731
Now, look, we don't know
if it's Godzilla

12:11.905 --> 12:12.949
or Hello Kitty down there,

12:13.123 --> 12:14.734
but as long
as we stick together,

12:14.908 --> 12:16.561
there is nothing
we can't handle.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.433
"Team Sonic" on three.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.088
One, two, three.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.480
Team...

12:22.654 --> 12:23.917
- Sonic!
- Knuckles!

12:26.180 --> 12:29.618
Talk about low-budget flights.
No food or movies?

12:29.792 --> 12:31.359
We're out of here!

12:54.599 --> 12:56.645
[Knuckles] What happened here?

12:56.819 --> 12:58.734
Looks like GUN
got their butts kicked.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.215
Keep your eyes open.
Tails, anything?

13:01.389 --> 13:03.913
Whoa! These energy readings
are off the charts!

13:06.002 --> 13:08.004
Look out!

13:09.353 --> 13:12.704
One... million... percent.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.416
Whoa! Are you guys seeing this?

13:28.590 --> 13:31.158
- He looks just like you.
- Impossible!

13:31.332 --> 13:32.986
You're a colorful bunch.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.554
Um, excuse me.
Why do you look like me?

13:36.728 --> 13:38.121
I don't look like you.

13:38.295 --> 13:41.124
You look like me!
Why do you look like me?

13:41.298 --> 13:44.998
Hey, you know what? I'll ask
the questions, new hedgehog!

13:45.172 --> 13:47.174
Who are you?
Why do you look like me?

13:47.348 --> 13:49.176
This is a waste of time.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.961
Walk away, before you get hurt.

13:52.135 --> 13:53.745
Whoa, whoa, easy, buddy.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.792
We don't want to fight you.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.664
Actually, Sonic,
I would like to fight.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.275
Not now.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.190
Why don't you stop throwing cars
at us for a second

14:03.364 --> 14:04.800
and come down here to talk?

14:04.974 --> 14:07.542
You jumped
out of a GUN helicopter.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.674
There's nothing to talk about.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.720
All right, then. Enough!

14:11.894 --> 14:13.113
Knuckles, no!

14:13.287 --> 14:15.855
Let us talk with our fists!

14:30.695 --> 14:31.871
Knuckles!

14:32.045 --> 14:34.221
Knuckles!
Knuckles, are you okay?

14:34.395 --> 14:35.613
No, not really. Ow!

14:38.181 --> 14:39.704
Who is this guy?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.054
He is much more impressive

14:41.228 --> 14:43.056
than the hedgehog
I fought previously.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.319
Dude, I'm standing right here.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.888
Now, come on!
He can't take us all at once.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.846
Ow!

14:58.898 --> 15:01.422
Okay, he took us all at once.

15:01.596 --> 15:02.553
Weakling.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.124
Don't try to follow me.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.043
Sonic, I know that look.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.045
Going after him is a bad idea.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.482
When has that ever stopped me?

15:22.095 --> 15:24.358
I got to ask,
one hedgehog to another,

15:24.532 --> 15:25.576
who does your highlights?

15:34.411 --> 15:37.806
Hey! Dangerously weaving
through traffic is my thing!

15:44.378 --> 15:45.814
Coming through!

15:49.600 --> 15:52.299
Why are you running away?
We were just getting started.

15:54.475 --> 15:55.824
The more you talk,

15:55.998 --> 15:57.782
the harder I want to hit you.

16:01.525 --> 16:02.874
Watch out!

16:04.311 --> 16:06.269
Ugh, I'm gonna throw up!

16:08.489 --> 16:10.708
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:13.146 --> 16:14.277
Yah!

16:51.358 --> 16:55.231
1.21 gigawatts.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.976
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

17:01.150 --> 17:01.890
Sonic!

17:02.064 --> 17:03.239
Are you okay?

17:03.413 --> 17:05.328
I'm fine, guys.
And before you ask,

17:05.502 --> 17:07.374
I handcuffed myself
for tactical reasons

17:07.548 --> 17:09.289
that I do not have time
to explain.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.334
You shouldn't have gone off
on your own.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.206
We're supposed to be a team.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.599
Sorry, buddy. I'm still
working on this teamwork thing.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.297
So now what?

17:17.471 --> 17:19.647
Well, I'm not jumping
out of any more helicopters

17:19.821 --> 17:21.823
until we get some answers
from GUN.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.564
We need somewhere to regroup.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.915
I know just the place.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.188
<i>Hai, chiizu.</i>

17:39.362 --> 17:40.624
It's an ambush!

17:40.798 --> 17:42.800
You'll never take us alive,
foul beasts!

17:42.974 --> 17:45.325
Calm down, Knuckles.
This is a Chao Garden.

17:45.499 --> 17:48.589
One of the top ten must-see
spots in all of Tokyo!

17:48.763 --> 17:50.678
It's a perfect place
for us to blend in.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.506
Are you Detective Pikachu?

17:52.680 --> 17:54.116
Yes, he is!

17:54.290 --> 17:57.250
He does look like a Pokémon.

17:57.424 --> 17:58.381
"Pika, pika!"

17:58.555 --> 18:00.340
Commander Walters!

18:00.514 --> 18:02.298
Sonic.

18:02.472 --> 18:05.214
Thank God you're all okay.
I'm sure you have questions.

18:05.388 --> 18:08.087
Just a big ticked-off
red and black one.

18:08.261 --> 18:09.653
Who was that guy?

18:09.827 --> 18:12.526
Shadow's story
began a lot like yours, Sonic.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.485
But where you found family
and friends on this planet,

18:15.659 --> 18:19.185
Shadow found only pain and loss.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.275
<i>It begins over 50 years ago,</i>

18:22.449 --> 18:25.582
<i>with a meteor crash
in a quiet corner of Oklahoma.</i>

18:25.756 --> 18:29.369
<i>The meteorite contained
a life-form.</i>

18:32.111 --> 18:33.895
<i>The ultimate life-form.</i>

18:35.897 --> 18:38.378
<i>Shadow's power...
his "chaos energy"...</i>

18:38.552 --> 18:41.555
<i>went far beyond
any living creature.</i>

18:44.166 --> 18:46.734
<i>The scientist who discovered
him believed this power</i>

18:46.908 --> 18:49.084
<i>would usher in a new era
for humanity.</i>

18:50.607 --> 18:53.741
<i>But Shadow's power
proved too dangerous.</i>

18:56.657 --> 18:58.659
<i>A terrible accident
destroyed the lab,</i>

18:58.833 --> 19:01.096
<i>taking human lives with it.</i>

19:01.270 --> 19:05.535
<i>The project leader was blamed
for the incident and imprisoned.</i>

19:05.709 --> 19:07.363
<i>With the program canceled...</i>

19:07.537 --> 19:10.497
<i>Shadow was a loose end
no one knew how to deal with.</i>

19:11.759 --> 19:13.674
<i>Too dangerous
to be walking free,</i>

19:13.848 --> 19:16.198
<i>too valuable to destroy.</i>

19:17.286 --> 19:19.462
<i>So I had him placed
into stasis...</i>

19:22.161 --> 19:24.163
<i>indefinitely.</i>

19:26.165 --> 19:29.255
Wait a second. If Shadow's
been on ice for 50 years,

19:29.429 --> 19:31.692
- someone had to help him escape.
- True.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.520
But there's only a few people
in the world

19:33.694 --> 19:35.565
who even know
of Shadow's existence.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.105
A live show? Yeah!

20:03.419 --> 20:04.420
Get down!

20:19.130 --> 20:20.393
Egg drones?

20:20.567 --> 20:23.265
But Robotnik
is supposed to be dead!

20:34.058 --> 20:36.322
Konnichi-what?

20:57.256 --> 21:01.347
I'm sorry, we already had our big
motorcycle chase for the evening.

21:06.003 --> 21:06.961
Commander Walters!

21:08.571 --> 21:10.617
Commander Walters, are you okay?

21:11.792 --> 21:12.793
Sonic...

21:15.404 --> 21:16.536
take this.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.755
What is it?[Walters] A key...

21:19.974 --> 21:22.542
to the most powerful weapon
GUN has ever built.

21:22.716 --> 21:25.240
You're the only one I trust
to keep it safe.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.591
Commander Walters...

21:37.426 --> 21:38.906
Alpha team, fan out!

21:40.299 --> 21:41.691
Do we have eyes?

21:42.344 --> 21:43.345
Secure the perimeter!

21:46.653 --> 21:48.002
Medevac is en route.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.312
His launch key is missing.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.756
I knew they couldn't be trusted.

22:06.803 --> 22:08.239
Why are we running from GUN?

22:08.414 --> 22:09.893
Aren't we on the same team?

22:10.067 --> 22:11.330
Until we get more information,

22:11.504 --> 22:13.201
we're not trusting anyone.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.072
- Follow me.
- Get it... off!

22:32.786 --> 22:34.788
Hold it right there,
Tokyo Drift!

22:34.962 --> 22:36.355
Who are you?

22:39.227 --> 22:41.577
It's the Goat Milker!

22:41.751 --> 22:44.014
"It's the Goat Milker!"

22:44.188 --> 22:46.234
Relax. I'm not here to fight.

22:46.408 --> 22:49.455
- Then why are you here?
- And why did you free Shadow?

22:49.629 --> 22:51.544
Are you kidding?

22:51.718 --> 22:55.330
The last thing we want is more
super-powered hedgehogs running around.

22:55.504 --> 22:57.463
The doctor had nothing
to do with it.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.988
And I can prove it.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.005
Please,

23:18.179 --> 23:19.223
join me in the crab.

23:20.790 --> 23:23.967
<i>And now back to...
"La UÚltima Pasión."</i>

23:24.141 --> 23:25.839
I have fallen in love
with another.

23:27.971 --> 23:31.235
But who, Gabriella? Tell me who!

23:33.063 --> 23:35.196
My twin brother, Pablo?

23:36.415 --> 23:37.851
<i>Pablo!</i>

23:39.766 --> 23:41.158
!¡Bastardo!

23:41.332 --> 23:43.726
Buenos días, !¡hermano!

23:43.900 --> 23:45.032
<i>No!</i>

23:47.513 --> 23:49.819
Let that be a lesson
to you, Juan.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.560
Family

23:51.734 --> 23:54.955
is a field
of emotional claymores

23:55.129 --> 23:57.348
that leave you abandoned,
betrayed

23:59.133 --> 24:02.005
and weeping while you eat cake,

24:02.179 --> 24:04.573
which creates copious amounts
of adipose tissue,

24:04.747 --> 24:07.750
and what some calloused
individuals refer to as...

24:07.924 --> 24:10.536
man boobs.

24:10.710 --> 24:11.885
Ha.

24:29.685 --> 24:31.731
Doctor, we have visitors.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.212
Really?

24:35.386 --> 24:38.085
I thought I was having
an anthropomorphic nightmare.

24:38.259 --> 24:39.739
Where the only person
I could trust in the world

24:39.913 --> 24:41.436
showed up with
all my worst enemies,

24:41.610 --> 24:43.307
while I was in a bathrobe,

24:43.482 --> 24:45.745
playing congas
on my big, fat belly!

24:45.919 --> 24:47.181
Sorry, sir.

24:47.355 --> 24:49.488
I don't believe it.
Eggman's alive?

24:49.662 --> 24:52.012
And he's never looked worse.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.493
Well, maybe,

24:54.667 --> 24:58.540
this is what not giving a damn
what you think I look like looks like.

24:58.714 --> 25:01.935
Sir, right now we have
an even bigger problem.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.502
Oh, come on.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.941
There's an imposter out there
using your technology.

25:08.115 --> 25:11.422
Imposter.
That's impossi... What?

25:11.597 --> 25:13.076
No.

25:13.250 --> 25:17.298
My sweet mechanized spawn!

25:17.472 --> 25:21.084
Whomever this party-pooping
posse is looking for

25:21.258 --> 25:23.565
has stolen my persona

25:23.739 --> 25:27.090
and the precious babies
from my egg sac.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.266
Well...

25:29.440 --> 25:33.836
I'll soon egg-xact my revenge.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.664
You see what I did there?

25:35.838 --> 25:39.059
It's time for the dramatic
soap-opera twist,

25:39.233 --> 25:43.367
where this Pablo
reveals his Juan!

25:43.542 --> 25:47.415
By cross-referencing
the precise coordinates

25:47.589 --> 25:50.331
of each drone's energy spikes,

25:51.071 --> 25:53.203
I can track my babies

25:53.377 --> 25:55.989
to the imposter's
base of operations,

25:56.163 --> 25:57.556
right about...

25:57.730 --> 25:58.557
there!

25:58.731 --> 26:00.471
Sonic, I hate to say it,

26:00.646 --> 26:02.822
but I think we're both
after the same person.

26:02.996 --> 26:05.433
Hold on, hold on. You're
not suggesting we team up

26:05.607 --> 26:07.914
with Doctor Ro-Butt-Stink,
are you?

26:08.088 --> 26:09.524
Perhaps the fox is right.

26:09.698 --> 26:12.571
It could be our only chance
to find this mysterious,

26:12.745 --> 26:14.137
more impressive hedgehog.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.706
All right, Egghead.
I hate to say it,

26:17.880 --> 26:19.447
but it looks like
we're partners.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.493
On one condition.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.541
Dude, you have serious issues.

26:26.715 --> 26:27.803
Ow!

26:31.633 --> 26:32.808
Let's...

26:33.592 --> 26:34.723
do this!

27:01.097 --> 27:02.316
Suck it in!

27:04.840 --> 27:06.189
Tinker-tailor?

27:06.363 --> 27:07.800
I need room.

27:07.974 --> 27:10.629
Think Elvis, circa 1976.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.066
But sir, I don't have
the proper materials.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.459
Found some.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.159
Resourceful.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.767
Hey! This is a restricted area.

28:01.941 --> 28:04.204
Oh, it's okay. She's the
professor's granddaughter.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.510
He takes her everywhere.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.775
Welcome to the lab, Maria.
I'm Captain Walters.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.341
Oh, do you know
where my room is?

28:11.515 --> 28:13.082
Yeah, down the hall
and to the right.

28:13.256 --> 28:14.780
Make yourself at home.

28:14.954 --> 28:16.129
But, um,

28:16.303 --> 28:18.087
let's lose the skates,
okay, kiddo?

28:18.261 --> 28:19.698
Okay.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.100
Look out!

31:25.013 --> 31:26.188
Wow.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.321
Look at all those stars.

31:30.149 --> 31:31.977
They're like diamonds.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.415
My grandfather says

31:35.589 --> 31:37.243
it can take hundreds of years

31:37.417 --> 31:39.419
for the light of a star
to reach Earth.

31:40.159 --> 31:42.030
And by the time you see it,

31:42.204 --> 31:44.511
the star might not even
exist anymore.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.514
Isn't that crazy?

31:48.994 --> 31:50.865
A light shines,

31:51.039 --> 31:52.998
even though the star is gone.

31:54.564 --> 31:56.392
Yeah, it does.

31:58.220 --> 31:59.918
I wonder which one
you came from, Shadow.

32:00.092 --> 32:00.962
I don't know.

32:02.094 --> 32:04.574
I don't know anything
about my home.

32:04.748 --> 32:07.142
This is your home, Shadow.

32:07.882 --> 32:09.014
Earth.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.239
Maria,

32:17.892 --> 32:19.589
do you think I'm...

32:20.547 --> 32:21.809
dangerous?

32:23.071 --> 32:24.899
What are you talking about?

32:25.073 --> 32:27.641
The way the scientists
look at me,

32:27.815 --> 32:29.512
I can tell they're afraid.

32:29.686 --> 32:33.255
Like I'm the horrible thing
from that movie we watched.

32:34.343 --> 32:35.779
I don't know...

32:36.476 --> 32:37.956
what I am.

32:43.222 --> 32:44.788
You're my friend.

32:46.138 --> 32:48.792
And you can do or be
anything you want.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.578
Not because of your powers,

32:51.752 --> 32:55.190
but because of who you are...
in here.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.195
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.804
Professor?

33:43.978 --> 33:47.025
It's good to see you, Shadow.

33:47.199 --> 33:49.288
I knew you'd come home.

33:49.462 --> 33:52.030
I can't get her out of my head.

33:52.204 --> 33:53.727
The pain...

33:53.901 --> 33:55.250
It's too much.

33:55.424 --> 33:58.906
And that is why
we have to punish them.

34:03.432 --> 34:05.043
Okay, I don't like you
and you don't like me.

34:05.217 --> 34:07.045
Let's get this
over with quickly.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.047
Out of my way, dorkupine.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.310
"Dorkupine"? Really clever.

34:17.794 --> 34:19.883
This door is six-inch-thick
solid steel

34:20.058 --> 34:21.842
on a pressurized latch.

34:22.016 --> 34:24.192
I'll need a moment to calculate
the molecular density

34:24.366 --> 34:25.976
and invert
the venting mechanics.

34:29.632 --> 34:30.894
I unlocked it.

34:31.069 --> 34:34.072
Subtle as always,
fist-for-brains.

34:35.334 --> 34:37.075
Easy, Shadow.

34:37.249 --> 34:39.729
Those are the guests
I've been expecting.

34:39.903 --> 34:42.558
Let's give them a warm welcome.

34:46.388 --> 34:47.737
Whoa.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.174
What is this place?

34:49.348 --> 34:51.306
It looks like a military base,

34:51.480 --> 34:53.308
but nobody's been here
for years.

34:53.482 --> 34:54.875
I wonder if it's haunted.

34:55.049 --> 34:57.965
Haunted? Nobody said anything
about being haunted.

34:58.139 --> 35:01.099
What's the matter?
You afraid of g-g-g-ghosts?

35:01.273 --> 35:03.362
Nothing scares
an Echidna warrior.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.929
Uh, yeah. Do you remember
what happened last movie night?

35:09.324 --> 35:10.760
Let go, let go, let go!

35:10.934 --> 35:13.633
There is no such thing
as a friendly ghost.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.723
So which way do we go?

35:16.897 --> 35:20.596
I know! We should split up.

35:20.770 --> 35:23.991
Everyone with hideous, brightly-colored
fur take the left and the middle.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.775
Stone and I will go right.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.690
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not
letting you out of my sight.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.649
Tails, you and Stone go left.

35:29.823 --> 35:32.913
Knuckles, you take the middle.
Eggman, you and me go right.

35:33.087 --> 35:35.002
By all means.

35:35.176 --> 35:36.656
We could use some time together.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.440
To work on your trust issues.

35:38.614 --> 35:41.443
You know what? You're right.
I should be more trusting.

35:41.617 --> 35:44.403
I mean, you've only tried
to kill me twice!

35:46.448 --> 35:48.668
Just a dark, creepy hallway.

35:48.842 --> 35:50.539
Nothing to be afraid of.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.977
You hear that, ghost?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.675
You don't frighten me!

36:00.158 --> 36:02.551
Get... a... grip.

36:03.465 --> 36:05.206
Boo.

36:07.904 --> 36:10.603
I'm just gonna
come right out and say this:

36:10.777 --> 36:13.562
You're adorable. Oh, um, thanks.

36:13.736 --> 36:17.175
So, what's it like
being Sonic's assistant?

36:17.349 --> 36:20.656
You have a daily routine?
Paid time off? Benefits?

36:20.830 --> 36:24.007
Oh, I'm not Sonic's assistant.
We're teammates.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.184
He's the leader,
Knuckles is the muscle,

36:26.358 --> 36:27.924
and I'm the gadget guy.

36:28.098 --> 36:29.448
We all have a role to play.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.363
That's what makes the team
so special!

36:31.537 --> 36:33.278
That and the fact
we're best friends.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.323
You are?

36:35.497 --> 36:37.325
Well, yeah.
Just like you and Eggman, right?

36:39.153 --> 36:41.199
Uh... Yeah, eh...

36:41.373 --> 36:43.375
Of course! Yes.

36:43.549 --> 36:46.421
Me and the doctor,
best of friends.

36:47.901 --> 36:49.468
That's definitely what we are.

36:54.690 --> 36:55.735
Hmm.

37:14.841 --> 37:18.410
Whoa. Look at all this stuff.

37:18.584 --> 37:21.717
This was more than
just a military base or a lab.

37:22.283 --> 37:23.719
It was a home.

37:23.893 --> 37:25.460
People lived here.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.549
He had a family.

37:28.289 --> 37:30.117
Is that what I smell?

37:30.291 --> 37:33.381
The stench of domestic harmony?

37:33.555 --> 37:37.080
You ever wonder what your life
would have been like if you had a family?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.691
Hmm... No!

37:38.865 --> 37:40.867
Maybe you wouldn't have gone
full supervillain.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.870
I have no parents,
no aunts, no uncles.

37:44.044 --> 37:46.568
And something about my attitude
renders me...

37:47.526 --> 37:51.660
undesirable
to all possible genders.

37:53.532 --> 37:55.708
My future is a cul-de-sac!

37:56.709 --> 37:58.711
The Robotnik name ends...

38:00.365 --> 38:02.018
<i>avec moi.</i>

38:02.192 --> 38:04.238
Yes, I know French.

38:08.764 --> 38:09.852
Whoa.

38:10.026 --> 38:13.029
Is this where you grew up,
Shadow?

38:13.203 --> 38:14.988
No wonder you're so mad.

38:15.162 --> 38:18.034
This place could really use
a beanbag chair

38:18.208 --> 38:19.514
and some comic books.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.256
What happened here?

38:24.302 --> 38:26.434
I'm tired
of giving you warnings!

38:30.308 --> 38:31.700
Where'd you go, hedgehog?

38:31.874 --> 38:33.746
I wasn't finished
trauma dumping.

38:35.574 --> 38:38.359
My darlings!

38:40.230 --> 38:42.668
My eggy weggies!

38:43.799 --> 38:46.846
<i>♪ Memories ♪</i>

38:47.020 --> 38:50.371

39:12.741 --> 39:13.742
I...

39:15.483 --> 39:17.224
- don't believe it.
- Don't you?

39:17.398 --> 39:18.660
- It's impossible.
- Is it?

39:18.834 --> 39:19.748
- It couldn't be.
- Couldn't it?

39:19.922 --> 39:20.706
I'm... Are you?

39:20.880 --> 39:22.055
Imposter!

39:22.229 --> 39:24.492
You stole my babies!

39:24.666 --> 39:27.843
But they know
who their real daddy is...

39:28.017 --> 39:29.105
drone-napper!

39:30.977 --> 39:34.067
Magnificent creations, my boy.

39:34.241 --> 39:36.809
I borrowed them to lure you here

39:36.983 --> 39:38.985
and reunite our family.

39:40.726 --> 39:42.380
You see, Ivo...

39:44.512 --> 39:47.515
I'm your grandfather:

39:47.689 --> 39:50.126
Gerald Robotnik.

39:54.174 --> 39:56.872
My... grandfather?

39:58.613 --> 40:01.486
But how? And why?

40:02.269 --> 40:04.314
And who did what with whom?

40:04.489 --> 40:09.407
You hail from an ancestry
of excellence...

40:09.581 --> 40:12.148
tied directly <i>à moi.</i>

40:12.322 --> 40:15.238
Yes, I know French.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.286
You do look like me.

40:20.243 --> 40:22.202
But fatter. And older.

40:23.072 --> 40:25.031
And there's that funny smell.

40:26.728 --> 40:29.557
But the resemblance is uncanny.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.038
It's as if...

40:32.212 --> 40:34.301
we're two characters
in a movie

40:34.475 --> 40:37.043
being played by the same actor.

40:37.217 --> 40:39.654
- But I need real proof!
- Ivo!

40:39.828 --> 40:41.134
We have very little time.

40:42.657 --> 40:44.790
But I could field
a couple of queries.

40:44.964 --> 40:48.097
Name the most elegant formula
in mathematics.

40:48.271 --> 40:49.621
Euler's Identity.

40:49.795 --> 40:52.101
E to the I times pi plus one
equals zilch.

40:52.275 --> 40:54.103
European capitals
arranged alphabetically

40:54.277 --> 40:55.540
by the fourth letter.

40:55.714 --> 40:57.455
Riga, Monaco, Sarajevo, Tirana.

40:57.629 --> 40:59.413
The speed of light divided
by the speed of sound,

40:59.587 --> 41:01.633
divided by the speed of
the bus in the movie <i>Speed.</i>

41:03.330 --> 41:05.898
17,893.33333...

41:06.072 --> 41:09.510
Rounding up? 17,894 MPH.

41:09.684 --> 41:12.165
And, for all the marbles...

41:12.339 --> 41:14.515
Good. I lost mine.

41:14.689 --> 41:16.735
A rare lung disease,

41:16.909 --> 41:19.999
and the longest word
in the English dictionary.

41:20.652 --> 41:22.131
Um...

41:22.305 --> 41:25.613
Pneumonoultramicroscopic-
silicovolcanoconiosis!

41:26.484 --> 41:30.139
- Pap-pap!
- In the saggy flesh.

41:30.313 --> 41:32.402
But looking pretty good
for a hundred and ten.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.451
Oh, Grampy-poo!

41:40.846 --> 41:44.632
Where have you been
my entire life?

41:46.547 --> 41:48.549
Wait.

41:48.723 --> 41:50.943
Where have you been...
my entire life?

41:51.117 --> 41:57.123
Locked in a top-secret
prison for the last 50 years.

41:57.297 --> 42:00.561
Made it kind of hard
to send Christmas cards.

42:00.735 --> 42:02.215
Now...

42:02.389 --> 42:05.958
you're probably wondering
why I brought you here.

42:06.132 --> 42:07.525
You didn't bring me here!

42:07.699 --> 42:11.006
I used my unparalleled intellect
to track you down.

42:11.180 --> 42:15.097
Per the plan I concocted
with my unparalleled intellect.

42:15.271 --> 42:17.056
You'll see.

42:17.230 --> 42:19.798
I have the answer to everything.

42:21.408 --> 42:23.062
Come on, kiddo.

42:36.858 --> 42:38.817
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

42:38.991 --> 42:40.819
Someone tell me
this is some kind of

42:40.993 --> 42:43.125
concussion-induced nightmare.

42:43.299 --> 42:45.432
There's two Eggmen now?

42:45.606 --> 42:47.608
Double your villains,
double your fun!

42:47.782 --> 42:50.568
Two Robotniks
are way worse than one.

42:50.742 --> 42:51.743
Chest bump?

42:51.917 --> 42:52.744
No.

42:53.832 --> 42:55.921
Stone, why are you tied up?

42:56.095 --> 42:58.663
Do that on your own time.
You sicken me.

42:58.837 --> 43:01.230
You must be
the long-lost grandson.

43:01.404 --> 43:04.277
And you must be
another stinking hedgehog.

43:04.451 --> 43:06.496
So you're the one
behind all this.

43:06.671 --> 43:08.890
- The Shadow breakout.
- The attack on Walters.

43:09.064 --> 43:10.239
That musty old-man smell.

43:10.413 --> 43:12.372
How dare you insult me

43:12.546 --> 43:14.200
with your unsolicited
exposition!

43:14.374 --> 43:16.463
Shadow, get the key.

43:16.637 --> 43:17.638
Where is it?

43:17.812 --> 43:19.901
Ha! Good one, Hot Topic.

43:20.075 --> 43:22.164
Do you really think
we'd be that stupid

43:22.338 --> 43:24.384
to bring the key right to you?

43:24.558 --> 43:25.994
Yep, we're that stupid.

43:26.168 --> 43:28.344
GUN took everything from us.

43:28.518 --> 43:31.434
And now we are going
to take everything from them.

43:31.609 --> 43:32.871
With this.

43:33.045 --> 43:36.701
My masterpiece of malevolence...

43:36.875 --> 43:39.399
The Eclipse Cannon.

43:39.573 --> 43:42.663
<i>In exchange for my freedom,</i>

43:42.837 --> 43:44.970
<i>I gave GUN
the most powerful weapon</i>

43:45.144 --> 43:47.668
<i>mankind has ever seen,</i>

43:47.842 --> 43:50.410
<i>capable of delivering
a precision strike</i>

43:50.584 --> 43:51.977
<i>anywhere on Earth.</i>

43:53.413 --> 43:54.632
<i>Our first target:</i>

43:55.458 --> 43:57.112
<i>GUN Headquarters.</i>

43:57.286 --> 43:59.419
But firing a weapon
that powerful

43:59.593 --> 44:01.551
could threaten millions
of innocent lives!

44:01.726 --> 44:03.989
Yeah, tera-bite me.

44:04.163 --> 44:09.037
This is one of two keys required
to launch the Eclipse Cannon.

44:09.211 --> 44:11.518
The other is locked
inside GUN headquarters.

44:11.692 --> 44:13.563
Once we have both,

44:13.738 --> 44:16.566
I will take rightful control
of my weapon.

44:16.741 --> 44:18.525
I'm in.

44:25.488 --> 44:26.968
Holy crab!

44:27.142 --> 44:28.753
Spacious and crustaceous.

44:29.667 --> 44:30.842
Thank you so much

44:31.016 --> 44:32.670
for inspiring
this little adventure.

44:32.844 --> 44:35.020
It really worked out for me.

44:35.194 --> 44:38.153
And you wonder why
I have trust issues!

44:39.633 --> 44:41.809
Shadow, wait! Don't do this.

44:41.983 --> 44:43.376
I know you're hurting,

44:43.550 --> 44:46.074
but don't let that change
who you are inside.

44:46.248 --> 44:50.513
I've spent 50 years
reliving what they did to her.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.603
This is who I am inside.

44:59.609 --> 45:03.657
Uh, nice magic marble.
Real scary.

45:06.878 --> 45:08.880
That actually is real scary!

45:10.969 --> 45:12.448
It's a mini black hole!

45:12.622 --> 45:14.973
It's going to suck in
all the matter in this base!

45:20.239 --> 45:22.154
Fear not, friends.

45:22.850 --> 45:24.722
Even my teeth are muscles!

45:30.292 --> 45:32.773
Sonic, try to reach
one of my rings!

45:32.947 --> 45:34.166
Got one.

45:34.340 --> 45:36.559
Check this out. Trick shot!

45:40.259 --> 45:41.739
Come on.

45:43.001 --> 45:44.567
Come on.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.395
Come on.

45:48.006 --> 45:49.703
Come on!

45:59.104 --> 46:01.628
Yeah! Yes!

46:05.327 --> 46:06.328
Yikes.

46:07.634 --> 46:09.418
Somebody better call
Google Maps.

46:13.335 --> 46:17.470
I've spent years trying
to cleanse the cosmos

46:17.644 --> 46:21.300
of that spiny, blue speed freak.

46:21.474 --> 46:23.128
And you did it...

46:24.651 --> 46:26.479
in one afternoon.

46:26.653 --> 46:30.570
There's nothing we can't
destroy together, my boy.

46:30.744 --> 46:33.616
Charting route to GUN
Headquarters in London, sirs.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.880
ETA four hours.

46:36.054 --> 46:37.359
As the crab flies.

46:37.533 --> 46:39.884
By all accounts,
we're ahead of schedule.

46:40.841 --> 46:42.756
We should take this time

46:42.930 --> 46:44.932
to get to know
each other better.

46:45.106 --> 46:46.847
Wow. What?

46:47.587 --> 46:48.675
You mean...

46:48.849 --> 46:52.113
spend some qua-qua-quality time?

46:52.287 --> 46:57.031
You've waited for this
your whole life.

46:57.205 --> 47:03.516
How would you choose to spend one
perfect day with your new grand pal?

47:57.396 --> 48:00.703
Ooh!

48:39.525 --> 48:40.961
And done!

48:41.135 --> 48:43.877
- Masterpiece.
- Look at that. - Yay!

48:44.051 --> 48:47.489
It's really been great
having time to ourselves.

48:47.663 --> 48:50.101
Right. Absolutely.
I just feel so...

48:50.275 --> 48:51.667
relaxed, you know? Clearheaded.

48:51.841 --> 48:54.148
Mmm, look at all these
new interests we found.

48:54.322 --> 48:56.324
- I know, so many hobbies.
- So many!

48:56.498 --> 48:59.327
After the action and adventure
of the last few years,

48:59.501 --> 49:01.721
- well, I could get used to this.
- Same.

49:07.466 --> 49:09.816
Tom! Maddie!
We need your help on a super...

49:09.990 --> 49:12.819
- Knuckles, do you mind?
- Oh! Excuse me.

49:12.993 --> 49:14.429
Tom! Maddie! We need your help

49:14.603 --> 49:16.127
on a super-dangerous
top-secret mission!

49:16.301 --> 49:17.345
Hmm.

49:19.086 --> 49:20.740
- Thank God. Yeah, we're in.
- Let's go.

49:20.914 --> 49:23.134
Really? You're in?
Just like that?

49:23.308 --> 49:26.050
- Yes. It was getting so boring.
- without you guys here. - Yeah. So...

49:26.224 --> 49:27.877
No offense... boring. No, none taken.

49:28.052 --> 49:29.531
I mean, whatever crazy plan
you're cooking up,

49:29.705 --> 49:31.011
- the answer's yes.
- Yes.

49:31.185 --> 49:34.145
Great. But first things first:
What is that?

49:34.319 --> 49:35.798
Oh! This is...

49:35.973 --> 49:37.409
Li'l Tom!

49:37.583 --> 49:39.063
Isn't he great?

49:40.629 --> 49:42.849
I told you to get rid of
that. It's very creepy.

49:43.023 --> 49:44.198
I told him to get rid of you.

49:44.372 --> 49:45.765
Okay, that's, mmm...

49:45.939 --> 49:48.159
- crossing a line there.
- You are in so much trouble.

49:50.248 --> 49:52.990
Okay, this is it.
The belly of the beast.

49:53.164 --> 49:55.427
GUN Headquarters in London.

49:55.601 --> 49:58.560
Tom, we're finally gonna
get to see London together.

49:58.734 --> 50:00.693
Hey, I told you we'd
get there someday, baby.

50:00.867 --> 50:02.564
Okay. So here's the plan.

50:02.738 --> 50:04.784
<i>I run in superfast,</i>

50:04.958 --> 50:06.916
<i>fly over that water, no problem,</i>

50:07.091 --> 50:08.396
<i>and right when I get to the...</i>

50:09.789 --> 50:11.443
What just happened?

50:11.617 --> 50:12.966
Congratulations.

50:13.140 --> 50:15.142
You just got incinerated
by their energy shield.

50:15.316 --> 50:18.928
We'll need to shut it down by
planting a USB drive in their server room

50:19.103 --> 50:21.322
<i>that will give me full control
over it.</i>

50:21.496 --> 50:23.107
That's what we need you two for.

50:23.281 --> 50:24.978
Couple of badass spies,
that's what we are.

50:25.152 --> 50:26.675
Mr. And Mrs. Smith.

50:26.849 --> 50:28.503
<i>Once we disable the shield,</i>

50:28.677 --> 50:30.505
<i>you'll face the laser hall.</i>

50:32.464 --> 50:35.728
<i>These high-density bad boys
will cut you into tiny pieces.</i>

50:37.208 --> 50:39.732
<i>And cut those pieces
into even tinier pieces!</i>

50:39.906 --> 50:41.995
Once again...

50:42.169 --> 50:44.389
Can't we just get Tom Cruise
to do this?[Tails] Nope.

50:44.563 --> 50:48.175
<i>Because not even he
could break into... the vault.</i>

50:48.349 --> 50:49.785
<i>Why is it empty in there?</i>

50:49.959 --> 50:51.396
<i>Because we have no idea</i>

50:51.570 --> 50:53.050
<i>what's on the other side
of that door.</i>

50:53.224 --> 50:55.704
<i>To prevent the vault from ever
being accessed by a ring,</i>

50:55.878 --> 50:58.838
<i>all images and schematics have
been wiped from GUN's database.</i>

50:59.012 --> 51:01.058
So for the last leg
of this heist...

51:02.320 --> 51:04.278
we're going in blind.

51:08.978 --> 51:10.197
Sorry.

51:10.371 --> 51:11.894
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

51:12.069 --> 51:14.462
It sounds like this plan would
work a heck of a lot better

51:14.636 --> 51:18.162
if Sonic used the Master Emerald
to go Golden God mode

51:18.336 --> 51:19.554
to get the key.

51:20.642 --> 51:22.166
No way, Maddie.

51:22.340 --> 51:24.298
The Master Emerald is too
powerful to ever use again.

51:24.472 --> 51:26.779
We made a promise to each other
to keep it hidden.

51:26.953 --> 51:29.086
In a location
only Knuckles knows.

51:29.260 --> 51:31.436
As guardian
of the Master Emerald,

51:31.610 --> 51:34.482
anyone who tries to take
it away for any reason...

51:34.656 --> 51:36.963
will become a sworn enemy.

51:37.137 --> 51:38.878
Okay, okay! Sheesh!

51:39.052 --> 51:40.662
No need to get
all growly on me, buddy.

51:40.836 --> 51:43.970
You guys are always telling us
to make good choices.

51:44.144 --> 51:45.885
Well, this is the right choice.

51:46.059 --> 51:47.626
Okay.

51:47.800 --> 51:50.107
I guess we're going to...

52:05.687 --> 52:07.515
London, baby!

52:10.779 --> 52:13.304
GUN Headquarters is right there.

52:13.478 --> 52:17.438
Let me go in, get the key
and destroy anyone in my way!

52:17.612 --> 52:19.179
I want revenge.

52:19.353 --> 52:20.702
Patience, Shadow.

52:20.876 --> 52:23.140
Just let us handle this...

52:24.141 --> 52:27.448
and I promise
you'll have revenge

52:27.622 --> 52:31.365
on a scale you couldn't
possibly imagine.

52:31.539 --> 52:34.542
Come on, Granddaddy-O,
we've got...

52:34.716 --> 52:35.761
dirt to do!

52:35.935 --> 52:37.719
Suits.

52:37.893 --> 52:38.894
Right here, sir.

52:39.939 --> 52:41.810
Stone, babysit the hedgehog.

52:41.984 --> 52:44.422
Keep the crab on a low boil.

52:45.597 --> 52:47.903
It's time
for more family bonding.

52:52.691 --> 52:54.171
Come on, Shadow.

52:54.345 --> 52:58.262
Got fresh avocados in the crab.
We'll make guac.

53:00.002 --> 53:01.830
Revenge guac!

53:09.751 --> 53:13.799
Guys, are you ready for me yet?
I've been waiting here all day.

53:16.584 --> 53:19.413
Sonic,
we literally just started.

53:19.587 --> 53:21.807
Tom, Maddie,
are you in position and ready?

53:21.981 --> 53:24.113
- We were born ready.
- Let's do this.

53:24.288 --> 53:25.506
<i>Knuckles, how about you?</i>

53:25.680 --> 53:27.813
I have taken my perch
atop the giant clock.

53:27.987 --> 53:30.642
Now, where is this glass
I'm supposed to break?

53:30.816 --> 53:32.296
Actually, Knucks, your job

53:32.470 --> 53:34.776
is to "Break Glass
in Case of Emergency."

53:34.950 --> 53:36.474
Understood.

53:36.648 --> 53:39.868
I will shatter this glass
like the jaw of a vile foe.

53:40.042 --> 53:41.957
In case of emergency.

53:42.131 --> 53:44.830
<i>I will pulverize it like
the skull of a loathsome rival!</i>

53:45.004 --> 53:48.094
Just to be clear, the
"emergency" is the important part.

53:48.268 --> 53:49.922
The glass will beg for mercy

53:50.096 --> 53:52.403
under the shadow
of my mighty fist!

53:52.577 --> 53:54.013
Guys, remember, we're a team.

53:54.187 --> 53:55.536
- Let's focus.
- Please.

53:55.710 --> 53:56.885
<i>You know what? Let's move on.</i>

53:57.059 --> 53:58.887
All right,
everyone knows what to do.

53:59.061 --> 54:01.150
Tom and Maddie,
you guys plant the USB drive.

54:01.325 --> 54:03.849
I'll disable the traps.
Sonic will snag the launch key.

54:04.023 --> 54:05.764
And Knuckles, you stand by to...

54:05.938 --> 54:08.288
Break glass in case
of emergency.

54:08.462 --> 54:09.681
See? He gets it.

54:09.855 --> 54:11.204
Then we're all set.

54:11.378 --> 54:12.945
Hologram time.

54:14.512 --> 54:15.426
You go first.

54:17.558 --> 54:19.256
Tom, it's me, Rachel!

54:19.430 --> 54:21.258
Can you believe it?
We're both in London together.

54:21.432 --> 54:23.216
Have you met your sister?
Try again.

54:23.390 --> 54:24.435
Unless...

54:24.609 --> 54:26.393
you're not up for this mission.

54:26.567 --> 54:28.787
Yeah, maybe you want to be back
in Green Hills, baking sourdough.

54:28.961 --> 54:30.615
- Thomas Michael Wachowski!
- Gah!

54:30.789 --> 54:32.225
You brought aliens
to my wedding,

54:32.399 --> 54:34.227
punched out my husband
and buried me in an avalanche.

54:34.401 --> 54:36.316
Your day of reckoning
is at hand!

54:36.490 --> 54:37.491
Yeah, that's perfect.

54:37.665 --> 54:40.102
Okay, now for her better half.

54:41.887 --> 54:46.674
Ho-ho, my name is Randall,
and I am too much to handle!

54:46.848 --> 54:48.502
Welcome to the gun show!

54:48.676 --> 54:51.723
Baby, would you describe me
as jacked, juiced,

54:51.897 --> 54:54.116
or shredded?

54:54.291 --> 54:55.944
I would describe your head
as swollen.

54:56.118 --> 54:57.294
Let's get to work.

55:00.949 --> 55:02.603
Agent Randall Handel.

55:02.777 --> 55:05.432
I'm here to have lunch
with my lovely wife, Rachel.

55:05.606 --> 55:06.912
I'm sorry, Agent Handel,

55:07.086 --> 55:09.349
this facility's
currently locked down.

55:09.523 --> 55:11.133
Command-level clearance only.

55:11.308 --> 55:13.310
One minute.

55:14.267 --> 55:16.530
Tails... we have a problem here.

55:16.704 --> 55:19.577
Wow, they must have tightened
security after Shadow's escape.

55:19.751 --> 55:21.230
I got this.

55:22.275 --> 55:23.798
You must be new here.

55:23.972 --> 55:26.627
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Rachel.

55:26.801 --> 55:28.194
Rachel Gonnagetyoufired.

55:29.413 --> 55:31.110
Do you know what GUN stands for?

55:31.284 --> 55:33.678
Well, 'course. Guardian Units...

55:33.852 --> 55:36.420
Getting. Ultra. Nasty.

55:36.594 --> 55:39.074
Do you want me...

55:39.248 --> 55:41.163
to get ultra nasty?

55:42.077 --> 55:43.296
Nasty nasty?

55:43.470 --> 55:45.037
- No, ma'am.
- Okay, then.

55:45.211 --> 55:46.865
Then go ahead and take
those little sad fingers

55:47.039 --> 55:48.475
and start tippity
type-type-typing!

55:48.649 --> 55:51.435
Mm-hmm. That's right, go on.

55:52.653 --> 55:54.046
Sorry for the inconvenience,
ma'am.

55:54.220 --> 55:55.395
Mm-hmm.

55:56.178 --> 55:58.093
That's what I thought!

56:01.314 --> 56:03.751
My God, I love being Rachel!

56:13.979 --> 56:16.155
- Did it work?
- Oh, yeah.

56:16.808 --> 56:18.505
Oh! Ouch!

56:19.724 --> 56:22.161
Director Rockwell seeking
access to the server room.

56:22.335 --> 56:23.554
<i>Just one moment, ma'am.</i>

56:24.859 --> 56:27.732
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
It's her. It's the real her!

56:27.906 --> 56:29.560
- The incident in Colorado?
- We're still assessing.

56:29.734 --> 56:30.952
What do you mean,
we're still assessing?

56:31.126 --> 56:32.998
- What do we do?
- Quick, change faces!

56:33.172 --> 56:34.303
Okay. Did it work?

56:34.478 --> 56:36.480
Who am I? What's going on?

56:36.654 --> 56:39.047
Why are you looking at me like
that? What am I doing wrong?

56:39.657 --> 56:40.962
Ow!

56:41.615 --> 56:42.747
Aye-aye, Captain!

56:46.054 --> 56:49.231
"Aye-aye, Captain"?
Who are you, Popeye?

56:49.406 --> 56:51.146
- I panicked! I was panicking!
- Jeez!

56:51.320 --> 56:52.496
Get it together!

56:56.369 --> 56:57.805
Okay, Tails,
what are we looking for?

56:57.979 --> 57:01.330
<i>The security server is
in the 7th row, 23rd cabinet.</i>

57:01.505 --> 57:06.074
Are you guys finished yet?
This is taking forever.

57:06.248 --> 57:08.381
[Sonic] Uh-oh.

57:08.555 --> 57:10.601
Has the time come
to break the glass?

57:10.775 --> 57:12.646
Or at least break something?

57:12.820 --> 57:14.605
All right, hang tight, guys.
Maddie's about to insert the drive.

57:15.388 --> 57:16.389
Ready?

57:16.563 --> 57:17.738
<i>Three...</i>

57:17.912 --> 57:19.044
<i>two...</i>

57:19.218 --> 57:20.480
<i>one...</i>

57:22.047 --> 57:23.309
Go.

57:26.530 --> 57:27.531
It didn't work.

57:27.705 --> 57:28.880
Did you put it in the right way?

57:29.054 --> 57:31.535
- Try punching it.
- Do not try punching it.

57:31.709 --> 57:32.797
Oh!

57:32.971 --> 57:34.755
- Take it out.
- and blow on it. - Yes!

57:34.929 --> 57:36.801
Oh, come on, Tom.

57:36.975 --> 57:39.368
<i>There's absolutely no
scientific evidence to support...</i>

57:42.415 --> 57:43.808
Never mind. It worked!

57:43.982 --> 57:45.113
Little trick from the '90s.

57:45.287 --> 57:47.681
I mean, best decade ever. Right?

57:47.855 --> 57:49.640
I'm shutting down
the outside sensors now.

57:49.814 --> 57:51.163
Yes! Uh...

57:51.337 --> 57:53.644
Hold on. Is...

57:53.818 --> 57:55.428
there supposed to be
another USB drive here?

57:55.602 --> 57:58.126
One with a giant mustache on it?

57:58.300 --> 58:01.565
Oh, no. I've got two heat
signatures en route to the vault.

58:01.739 --> 58:03.088
Which can only mean...

58:09.529 --> 58:12.706
The Robotniks
have entered the chat.

58:13.707 --> 58:14.882
Wait.

58:15.056 --> 58:16.231
Poppyseed?

58:17.885 --> 58:19.365
Grand-geezer?

58:19.539 --> 58:20.975
<i>¿Dónde está?</i>

58:21.149 --> 58:22.890
I'm right here.

58:23.064 --> 58:24.631
If you weren't family,

58:24.805 --> 58:26.633
I could have gut you
like a pheasant.

58:26.807 --> 58:29.810
I mean, try to keep up.

58:33.248 --> 58:36.600
<i>And now back to
"La UÚltima Pasión."</i>

58:36.774 --> 58:38.166
<i>UÚltima Pasión...</i>

58:38.950 --> 58:41.169
can only belong to one.

58:41.343 --> 58:42.388
No.

58:43.389 --> 58:46.827
It can only belong... to Juan!

58:47.001 --> 58:49.395
Gabriella should kill them both.

58:49.569 --> 58:52.050
She's not a prize to be won.

58:52.224 --> 58:54.313
"Kill this. Murder that."

58:54.487 --> 58:57.882
You need to lighten up, Shadow.
We're about to rule the world.

58:58.056 --> 59:00.188
When we're done...

59:00.362 --> 59:03.104
there won't be
anything left to rule.

59:03.278 --> 59:05.890
That is dark. Even for you.

59:06.847 --> 59:08.414
What are you
and the professor up to?

59:08.588 --> 59:10.459
Hello! What's this?

59:10.634 --> 59:13.201
I knew I saw an outside signal!

59:13.375 --> 59:15.247
<i>Cheerio!</i>

59:15.421 --> 59:17.379
<i>I guess someone forgot to flush.</i>

59:38.357 --> 59:41.229
What now, my cunning cohort?

59:41.403 --> 59:42.927
Just a little teamwork!

59:50.848 --> 59:52.023
Hey...

59:52.676 --> 59:54.068
The lasers...

59:55.156 --> 59:57.768
don't seem to be
penetrating my suit.

59:59.117 --> 1:00:02.163
They're conforming to the
shape of my bodacious bod.

1:00:02.337 --> 1:00:03.774
Of course.

1:00:05.950 --> 1:00:07.604
I designed these suits
to create a field

1:00:07.778 --> 1:00:09.867
of laser-bending
thermal distortion.

1:00:10.041 --> 1:00:11.956
Wasn't sure it would work
till now.

1:00:12.130 --> 1:00:13.566
You're heartless, son.

1:00:13.740 --> 1:00:15.612
- Hmm!
- Rotten to the core.

1:00:15.786 --> 1:00:17.483
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm...

1:00:17.657 --> 1:00:18.876
so proud.

1:00:19.050 --> 1:00:21.400
So now we can just dance
right through.

1:00:24.011 --> 1:00:26.100
That sounds like a challenge.

1:01:11.798 --> 1:01:14.714
<i>♪ My finger is on the button ♪</i>

1:01:14.888 --> 1:01:16.063
<i>♪ Push the button ♪</i>

1:01:32.950 --> 1:01:34.908
The Robotniks are almost
at the vault!

1:01:35.082 --> 1:01:37.171
We're out of time. I'm going.

1:01:37.345 --> 1:01:38.477
No, Sonic!

1:01:38.651 --> 1:01:39.826
I haven't disabled
the traps yet!

1:01:41.915 --> 1:01:43.482
Too late!

1:01:43.656 --> 1:01:46.615
Look at me! I'm running
on the wrong side of the road!

1:01:49.793 --> 1:01:51.446
Well, I got to take in
the sights.

1:01:51.620 --> 1:01:53.666
Paul, John, George,
the other one!

1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:55.537
Loud American coming through!

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:57.148
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1:01:57.322 --> 1:01:58.758
'Ello, guv'nor!
Which way to Hogwarts?

1:01:58.932 --> 1:02:00.368
Hear ye, hear ye!

1:02:00.542 --> 1:02:02.719
Sonic the Hedgehog
wants a cuppa tea!

1:02:02.893 --> 1:02:04.546
Hold this for me, please.

1:02:05.809 --> 1:02:07.158
You're not gonna make it!

1:02:07.332 --> 1:02:08.333
I can make it.

1:02:11.858 --> 1:02:13.251
You're not gonna make it!

1:02:13.425 --> 1:02:14.600
I'm gonna make it.

1:02:16.341 --> 1:02:17.516
I'm not gonna make it.

1:02:17.690 --> 1:02:20.127
I'm not gonna make it!

1:02:24.741 --> 1:02:26.568
- Made it!
- Whoo!

1:02:28.266 --> 1:02:30.268
Excuse me. Coming through.
No time for autographs.

1:02:30.442 --> 1:02:31.486
Got to go, bye!

1:02:38.755 --> 1:02:41.366
Our destiny awaits.

1:02:42.454 --> 1:02:44.282
Stop right there, Roboscum!

1:02:44.456 --> 1:02:46.675
- Let's do this!
- Copy!

1:02:53.987 --> 1:02:55.554
Too slow, Eggmen.

1:02:55.728 --> 1:02:58.992
Now if you don't mind,
I've got to get that key.

1:02:59.166 --> 1:03:00.515
Whoa!

1:03:00.689 --> 1:03:02.691
My feet. Why can't I
use my beautiful feet?

1:03:02.866 --> 1:03:04.345
Heh-heh![Rockwell] Because...

1:03:04.519 --> 1:03:07.566
this vault is armed
with variable gravity.

1:03:09.133 --> 1:03:09.960
No kidding.

1:03:10.134 --> 1:03:11.918
Green goes up...

1:03:12.092 --> 1:03:14.268
and red takes you down... hard.

1:03:14.442 --> 1:03:15.617
Rockwell, listen to me.

1:03:15.792 --> 1:03:17.576
The Robotniks are planning to...

1:03:17.750 --> 1:03:19.665
Oh, they're planning on stealing
a second key, just like you are?

1:03:19.839 --> 1:03:21.232
Yes, I'm aware.

1:03:22.755 --> 1:03:25.279
I called it the second
Commander Walters was attacked.

1:03:25.453 --> 1:03:26.933
So...

1:03:27.107 --> 1:03:29.675
thank you for taking the bait

1:03:29.849 --> 1:03:31.329
and falling right into my trap.

1:03:31.503 --> 1:03:33.635
I don't believe this.

1:03:33.810 --> 1:03:35.420
I know, grandson.

1:03:35.594 --> 1:03:37.596
A woman in the military!

1:03:39.511 --> 1:03:40.947
Let's go.

1:03:42.035 --> 1:03:43.254
Go, positions!

1:03:43.428 --> 1:03:44.516
Full perimeter.

1:03:46.083 --> 1:03:47.388
Robotnik.

1:03:47.562 --> 1:03:49.826
Going full spandex, huh?
Who's the fossil?

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.134
That's my grandfather,
you dough-eating dimbecile.

1:03:54.308 --> 1:03:57.398
- Who are they?
- A couple of bleeding hearts,

1:03:57.572 --> 1:04:00.401
here to rescue
their emotional-support animals.

1:04:00.575 --> 1:04:02.360
Enough! It's over.

1:04:02.534 --> 1:04:06.103
The only way you're
leaving here is in handcuffs.

1:04:06.277 --> 1:04:07.974
There is no other way out.

1:04:08.148 --> 1:04:10.934
You know, there might be
one other way out.

1:04:11.108 --> 1:04:12.500
And what is that
supposed to mean?

1:04:12.674 --> 1:04:14.589
Hey, big guy,
I think it's time to...

1:04:15.764 --> 1:04:19.072
Break glass
in case of emergency!

1:04:26.210 --> 1:04:29.256
Ha! Nothing can stop
Team Knuckles!

1:04:29.430 --> 1:04:30.518
Open fire!

1:04:31.519 --> 1:04:33.391
Knuckles, turn this stuff off!

1:04:33.565 --> 1:04:34.871
- Hurry!
- On it.

1:04:36.481 --> 1:04:37.569
Uh-oh.

1:04:45.185 --> 1:04:47.535
Ha! See how you like it...

1:04:55.065 --> 1:04:57.110
- Can you move?
- No, not at all.

1:04:57.284 --> 1:04:59.721
- Tails, can you?
- No, I'm stuck.

1:04:59.896 --> 1:05:01.288
We might be here a while.

1:05:03.638 --> 1:05:05.902
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1:05:06.903 --> 1:05:08.339
Where's the key?

1:05:14.258 --> 1:05:15.476
Whoa!

1:05:15.650 --> 1:05:18.305
- What was that?
- We might have a problem.

1:05:19.959 --> 1:05:21.918
No, no, no, no!

1:05:42.634 --> 1:05:44.723
I'm moving.

1:05:45.506 --> 1:05:47.117
I'm moving!

1:05:50.294 --> 1:05:52.731
You go get it, grandson!

1:05:53.471 --> 1:05:54.515
Hey!

1:05:54.689 --> 1:05:56.517
Oh, whoa, whoa...

1:05:59.042 --> 1:06:00.913
No. No, no!

1:06:01.522 --> 1:06:03.220
I'm almost there!

1:06:06.049 --> 1:06:06.832
Whoa!

1:06:12.011 --> 1:06:13.578
Sonic!

1:06:26.634 --> 1:06:28.985
That was so not worth it!

1:06:29.986 --> 1:06:31.117
Ooh!

1:06:34.251 --> 1:06:35.992
- You okay?
- Yeah. You good?

1:06:36.166 --> 1:06:36.905
Sonic!

1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:38.907
Hey.

1:06:39.082 --> 1:06:42.302
Sonic, one,
concrete boulder, zero.

1:06:43.608 --> 1:06:44.913
Thanks for the save.

1:06:45.088 --> 1:06:46.611
Cutting it a little close,
don't you think?

1:06:48.047 --> 1:06:49.396
Secure the room!

1:06:51.398 --> 1:06:52.617
She's got the key.

1:06:55.359 --> 1:06:56.447
I got an idea.

1:07:05.673 --> 1:07:07.110
Commander Walters.

1:07:07.284 --> 1:07:08.372
Sir.

1:07:08.546 --> 1:07:10.156
You're... Still alive?

1:07:10.330 --> 1:07:13.116
I'll die before I let that key
fall into the wrong hands.

1:07:13.986 --> 1:07:15.379
Thanks for keeping it safe.

1:07:15.553 --> 1:07:17.033
I'll take it from here.

1:07:19.731 --> 1:07:21.559
That's an order,
Director Rockwell.

1:07:25.258 --> 1:07:27.913
Now, organize
the reinforcements.

1:07:29.262 --> 1:07:30.350
Yes, sir.

1:07:36.095 --> 1:07:38.315
Guys, guys, I got the key.
I repeat, I got the key.

1:07:38.489 --> 1:07:40.099
Now let's get out of here.

1:07:44.321 --> 1:07:46.584
Commander Walters.

1:07:46.758 --> 1:07:48.455
No, no. No. Wait!

1:08:02.730 --> 1:08:04.167
What?

1:08:04.341 --> 1:08:06.865
Tom! Everyone's clear!
Come on, let's go!

1:08:07.039 --> 1:08:08.910
You. What are you...

1:08:10.608 --> 1:08:11.652
Tom!

1:08:12.784 --> 1:08:14.829
Tom. Tom, what happened?

1:08:15.003 --> 1:08:16.527
Speak to me. Come on.

1:08:16.701 --> 1:08:18.877
Come on, it's gonna be okay.

1:08:19.051 --> 1:08:22.098
Please, please, please get up.
Hey, come on, please wake up.

1:08:22.272 --> 1:08:23.882
Wake up, wake up, come on.

1:08:24.578 --> 1:08:25.971
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

1:08:26.667 --> 1:08:28.104
Maria.

1:08:32.151 --> 1:08:33.848
What did you do?

1:08:36.068 --> 1:08:38.114
What I had to.

1:08:40.768 --> 1:08:42.466
Oh, my God. Tom!

1:08:45.686 --> 1:08:47.384
Help me up, kid.

1:08:50.213 --> 1:08:51.518
Freeze! Don't move!

1:08:51.692 --> 1:08:56.567
Any tricks up your sleeve,
Captain Grandtastic?

1:09:03.313 --> 1:09:05.358
We got what we came for.

1:09:06.098 --> 1:09:08.970
Great job, Shadow.

1:09:09.710 --> 1:09:12.583
We have both keys.

1:09:12.757 --> 1:09:15.542
So where's your little
science project?

1:09:16.935 --> 1:09:20.895
It's closer than you think,
my boy.

1:09:23.071 --> 1:09:24.595
Welcome...

1:09:24.769 --> 1:09:28.120
to my masterpiece!

1:09:31.036 --> 1:09:32.777
I must hand it to GUN.

1:09:32.951 --> 1:09:36.389
They built her
to my exact specifications.

1:09:36.563 --> 1:09:37.738
It's...

1:09:39.392 --> 1:09:40.959
remarkable!

1:09:41.133 --> 1:09:42.352
Mm-hmm.

1:09:42.526 --> 1:09:45.355
- Astounding!
- Yes.

1:09:46.486 --> 1:09:48.619
That's my genius grand-genome!

1:09:48.793 --> 1:09:52.405
And I have one more surprise.

1:09:54.886 --> 1:09:58.890
It's a new suit!

1:10:08.465 --> 1:10:09.292
Gee.

1:10:28.833 --> 1:10:31.227
<i>♪ I'm a chip Off the old block ♪</i>

1:10:31.401 --> 1:10:33.490
<i>♪ I'm a chip Off the old block ♪</i>

1:10:33.664 --> 1:10:36.449
<i>♪ I'm a chip off
The old block! ♪</i>

1:10:38.103 --> 1:10:40.018
What do you want, Stone?
I'm busy.

1:10:40.192 --> 1:10:43.195
Doctor, I have a bad feeling
about this.

1:10:43.369 --> 1:10:46.329
I don't think your grandfather's
been completely honest with us.

1:10:46.503 --> 1:10:48.200
It was something Shadow said.

1:10:48.983 --> 1:10:50.202
<i>There's more to their plan.</i>

1:10:51.638 --> 1:10:54.685
How dare you!

1:10:54.859 --> 1:10:57.644
You have been jealous
of my long-lost grand-Pop-Tart

1:10:57.818 --> 1:10:59.951
since the very beginning!

1:11:00.125 --> 1:11:02.780
I no longer require
your obsequious groveling.

1:11:02.954 --> 1:11:05.435
<i>Consider this your notice
of termination.</i>

1:11:05.609 --> 1:11:09.003
Your letter of reference
will be L for Loser.

1:11:09.177 --> 1:11:11.005
Of course,
I'll expect you to stay on

1:11:11.179 --> 1:11:12.659
until you've been
successfully cloned.

1:11:12.833 --> 1:11:16.315
But you and I are done!

1:11:16.489 --> 1:11:18.926
Like a blackened catfish dinner!

1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:22.365
Sir, it's too dangerous and
I'm not there to protect you.

1:11:22.539 --> 1:11:23.670
I already lost you once! I...

1:11:23.844 --> 1:11:25.977
Unsubscribe.
Blocked and reported.

1:11:27.195 --> 1:11:29.110
I can't lose you again.

1:11:35.552 --> 1:11:37.118
Do the honors...

1:11:37.858 --> 1:11:39.033
grandson.

1:11:40.948 --> 1:11:42.254
Here we go.

1:13:16.522 --> 1:13:18.263
It'll be okay, Sonic.

1:13:18.437 --> 1:13:20.091
It'll be okay?

1:13:20.265 --> 1:13:22.789
Tom is fighting for his life
and you think it'll be okay?

1:13:22.963 --> 1:13:26.184
The fox is simply trying
to comfort you.

1:13:26.358 --> 1:13:28.229
Comfort's not
what I need right now.

1:13:28.404 --> 1:13:31.537
I need to stop them.
By any means necessary.

1:13:31.711 --> 1:13:32.886
Wait, you don't mean...

1:13:33.060 --> 1:13:35.149
The Master Emerald.

1:13:35.323 --> 1:13:38.501
The Emerald must never be
wielded for vengeance.

1:13:38.675 --> 1:13:39.719
Not ever!

1:13:39.893 --> 1:13:41.547
We swore a sacred oath.

1:13:41.721 --> 1:13:43.680
Don't talk to me about oaths.
Not now!

1:13:43.854 --> 1:13:45.725
But you told Tom
using the Emerald

1:13:45.899 --> 1:13:47.335
wasn't the right choice.

1:13:47.510 --> 1:13:49.599
Well, now it's the only choice.

1:13:49.773 --> 1:13:51.557
And if neither of you
have the guts to help me,

1:13:51.731 --> 1:13:53.167
then I'll do it alone.

1:13:53.341 --> 1:13:55.431
But I thought the
three of us were a team.

1:13:55.605 --> 1:13:57.607
I thought that's what
made us special.

1:13:57.781 --> 1:13:59.565
I'm not asking you twice,
Knuckles.

1:14:00.436 --> 1:14:03.264
Where is the Master Emerald?

1:14:05.005 --> 1:14:08.356
Your heart is being consumed
by anger, hedgehog.

1:14:08.531 --> 1:14:11.577
You are in no condition
to make decisions right now.

1:14:11.751 --> 1:14:14.319
I know you're upset about Tom.
We all are.

1:14:14.493 --> 1:14:16.190
Last chance.

1:14:16.364 --> 1:14:18.976
Where... is it?

1:14:19.542 --> 1:14:21.065
Don't do this.

1:14:27.724 --> 1:14:30.683
Part of our oath
is to trust each other.

1:14:30.857 --> 1:14:33.077
And I must abide
by that promise,

1:14:33.251 --> 1:14:35.558
even if you have chosen
to break it.

1:14:35.732 --> 1:14:37.473
But heed this warning:

1:14:37.647 --> 1:14:40.998
The Master Emerald is guarded
by a fearsome warrior.

1:14:41.172 --> 1:14:43.348
And to seize
this ultimate power,

1:14:43.522 --> 1:14:45.437
you will have to go...

1:14:45.611 --> 1:14:47.657
through him.

1:14:49.136 --> 1:14:51.748
Okay, Wade...
all comes down to this.

1:14:52.488 --> 1:14:54.141
Last few seconds.

1:14:54.315 --> 1:14:55.447
Whipple down the ice.

1:14:55.621 --> 1:14:59.146
He shoots... he scores!

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:02.367
Wade Whipple
is a champion again!

1:15:08.286 --> 1:15:11.463
Oh, hey, Sonic. See my goal?
Pretty sick, right?

1:15:11.637 --> 1:15:13.465
I'm here for the Emerald.

1:15:13.639 --> 1:15:15.162
Look, Sonic, I'm sorry.

1:15:15.336 --> 1:15:17.513
I promised to guard this emerald
with my life.

1:15:17.687 --> 1:15:19.515
I will do whatever it takes...

1:15:20.646 --> 1:15:21.734
Well, I tried.

1:15:27.174 --> 1:15:28.175
Sonic!

1:15:32.092 --> 1:15:33.093
Too bright!

1:15:36.706 --> 1:15:39.752
<i>This is an urgent
national emergency broadcast.</i>

1:15:39.926 --> 1:15:42.363
<i>A spacecraft designed
by the agency GUN</i>

1:15:42.538 --> 1:15:45.453
<i>has been hijacked and launched
out of the River Thames.</i>

1:15:51.242 --> 1:15:54.288
<i>All residents are urged
to seek immediate shelter.</i>

1:16:16.354 --> 1:16:18.617
It's time, Shadow.

1:16:20.271 --> 1:16:24.362
Professor, is this really
what Maria would have wanted?

1:16:27.147 --> 1:16:30.498
The question isn't
what Maria would have wanted.

1:16:31.630 --> 1:16:33.632
It's what do they deserve.

1:16:34.633 --> 1:16:37.114
Remember what she meant to us.

1:16:38.985 --> 1:16:41.901
Remember what they took from us.

1:16:52.346 --> 1:16:53.391
Kids!

1:16:53.565 --> 1:16:55.480
We have to go, now!

1:17:00.703 --> 1:17:03.140
They want to take
Shadow away from us, Maria!

1:17:11.757 --> 1:17:14.455
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
Those are children.

1:17:14.630 --> 1:17:16.414
- We've got our orders, Walters!
- Stand down!

1:17:40.264 --> 1:17:41.482
Huh?

1:17:43.049 --> 1:17:44.137
Maria!

1:18:31.619 --> 1:18:34.622
Excuse me, Grand Paso Doble.

1:18:34.797 --> 1:18:37.756
What is that thermonuclear
gerbil doing?

1:18:37.930 --> 1:18:40.280
Infusing the core...

1:18:40.454 --> 1:18:41.934
with chaos energy.

1:18:42.108 --> 1:18:44.720
That's my little secret.

1:18:44.894 --> 1:18:47.505
The Eclipse Cannon
is about to turn this planet

1:18:47.679 --> 1:18:50.464
into a flaming pile of rubble,

1:18:50.638 --> 1:18:55.469
wiping out everything
in a 25,000-mile radius.

1:18:58.646 --> 1:19:00.823
Including us.

1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:06.002
What?

1:19:06.916 --> 1:19:10.006
We can't annihilate the Earth!

1:19:10.180 --> 1:19:14.619
- Hmm?
- By combining our genius, we can rule humanity.

1:19:14.793 --> 1:19:15.707
Together!

1:19:15.881 --> 1:19:18.971
Humanity is a failed experiment.

1:19:19.145 --> 1:19:21.365
If anyone should know that,
it's you.

1:19:23.106 --> 1:19:26.022
All your life, you've been
rejected by this world.

1:19:26.892 --> 1:19:28.546
You have nothing down there.

1:19:30.156 --> 1:19:32.202
No one who cares about you.

1:19:33.986 --> 1:19:35.553
But I have you now.

1:19:38.251 --> 1:19:39.644
We're family.

1:19:40.558 --> 1:19:42.168
We have each other.

1:19:43.648 --> 1:19:44.910
Oh, Ivo...

1:19:46.738 --> 1:19:48.435
you're no Maria.

1:19:51.787 --> 1:19:55.747
The moment I lost her,
my family was gone forever!

1:19:57.401 --> 1:19:59.142
The only way to give
Maria's life meaning

1:19:59.316 --> 1:20:01.579
is to destroy the world
that took her from me.

1:20:02.449 --> 1:20:04.582
So I'm burning it all down!

1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:08.455
It's done.

1:20:08.629 --> 1:20:10.936
Good work, Shadow.

1:20:11.110 --> 1:20:12.982
I'm prepping
the firing sequence.

1:20:13.156 --> 1:20:17.029
The weapon will be fully charged
in ten minutes.

1:20:20.990 --> 1:20:23.079
It's almost finished, Maria.

1:20:23.993 --> 1:20:26.343
You will have justice.

1:20:30.738 --> 1:20:32.044
What is that?

1:20:32.958 --> 1:20:35.918
Is GUN launching missiles at us?

1:20:36.092 --> 1:20:39.138
Impossible.
It's moving too fast.

1:20:42.359 --> 1:20:43.882
It's him.

1:20:52.369 --> 1:20:56.677
You hurt my family.
This ends now!

1:20:56.852 --> 1:20:58.549
Now you know my anger.

1:20:58.723 --> 1:21:01.595
The pain I've felt for 50 years.

1:21:01.769 --> 1:21:05.034
And you've made
the same choice I did.

1:21:05.208 --> 1:21:06.774
I'm nothing like you!

1:21:06.949 --> 1:21:08.037
We'll see.

1:21:15.871 --> 1:21:17.481
Show yourself, coward!

1:21:49.295 --> 1:21:50.949
You were right about one thing.

1:21:52.820 --> 1:21:55.171
This ends now.

1:22:21.762 --> 1:22:22.807
What's happening?

1:22:22.981 --> 1:22:24.113
Where are they?

1:22:25.157 --> 1:22:26.419
- Up there.
- Where?

1:22:26.593 --> 1:22:27.507
- Higher.
- Hmm?

1:22:29.248 --> 1:22:30.510
Left yourself open.

1:22:30.684 --> 1:22:32.469
Ivo! What are you doing?

1:22:32.643 --> 1:22:34.036
Thwarting your evil plan!

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:46.918
- Not the mustache!
- Agreed.

1:22:47.092 --> 1:22:49.790
Let go on three.
One, two, three!

1:22:54.970 --> 1:22:58.234
Oh... a nano-fist.

1:22:58.408 --> 1:23:02.107
I haven't seen that since I
hate-watched <i>Green Lantern</i> in 2011.

1:23:02.281 --> 1:23:04.240
I was saving it for Comic-Con.

1:23:04.414 --> 1:23:06.459
But now there won't
be a Comic-Con!

1:23:29.091 --> 1:23:32.137
Why are you alone?
Where are your friends?

1:23:34.009 --> 1:23:36.402
They tried to stop you,
didn't they?

1:23:36.576 --> 1:23:38.056
But you came anyway.

1:23:38.230 --> 1:23:40.667
Your anger was too much.

1:23:40.841 --> 1:23:43.583
What kind of hero
abandons his friends

1:23:43.757 --> 1:23:45.803
to pursue revenge?

1:23:45.977 --> 1:23:48.284
Abandons his family!

1:23:48.458 --> 1:23:51.069
Don't you dare talk
about my family.

1:23:51.243 --> 1:23:53.985
And here I thought
you cared for them.

1:23:54.159 --> 1:23:57.293
Especially the one...
What's his name?

1:23:57.467 --> 1:23:58.685
Tom?

1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:27.453
Go ahead. Finish it!

1:24:29.151 --> 1:24:31.501
What are you waiting for? Do it!

1:24:31.675 --> 1:24:34.243
I'm right here!

1:24:35.418 --> 1:24:37.550
You didn't let your pain
change who you are...

1:24:38.986 --> 1:24:40.031
in here.

1:24:48.474 --> 1:24:50.433
This is not who I am.

1:24:51.129 --> 1:24:52.783
What are you doing?

1:24:52.957 --> 1:24:55.829
You won. Take your revenge.

1:24:57.701 --> 1:24:59.833
There are no winners
with revenge.

1:25:13.151 --> 1:25:14.892
<i>Wow.</i>

1:25:15.066 --> 1:25:16.502
Look at all those stars.

1:25:17.982 --> 1:25:19.592
<i>They're like diamonds.</i>

1:25:21.855 --> 1:25:25.207
The last time I sat
beneath stars like this...

1:25:27.209 --> 1:25:28.775
I was with her.

1:25:30.342 --> 1:25:32.866
I've felt this pain for so long.

1:25:34.564 --> 1:25:36.261
It's all I know.

1:25:36.435 --> 1:25:38.655
When I lost Longclaw...

1:25:38.829 --> 1:25:40.526
I felt the same way.

1:25:42.311 --> 1:25:44.748
Did your pain eventually
go away?

1:25:44.922 --> 1:25:46.880
No.

1:25:47.054 --> 1:25:48.969
But in time,
I learned there's something

1:25:49.144 --> 1:25:51.450
even more powerful than pain.

1:25:51.624 --> 1:25:53.713
The love we felt for each other.

1:25:54.932 --> 1:25:56.760
That's what you need
to hold on to, Shadow.

1:25:56.934 --> 1:25:59.154
Maria might be gone,

1:25:59.328 --> 1:26:01.330
but your love
will always remain.

1:26:15.996 --> 1:26:20.000
"The light shines
even though the star is gone."

1:26:31.838 --> 1:26:33.753
This whole mess is my fault.

1:26:33.927 --> 1:26:36.756
I've been so blinded by rage,
I thought...

1:26:37.453 --> 1:26:39.237
I had no choice.

1:26:42.762 --> 1:26:45.156
You always have a choice.

1:26:50.117 --> 1:26:52.859
But making the right one
is never easy.

1:26:53.033 --> 1:26:54.731
One more thing I learned

1:26:54.905 --> 1:26:57.690
is that when you
really screw something up,

1:26:57.864 --> 1:26:59.344
you can't fix it on your own.

1:27:14.533 --> 1:27:16.187
Gotta go fast.

1:27:16.361 --> 1:27:18.711
Don't tell me you've
got a catchphrase.

1:27:18.885 --> 1:27:22.237
That's right, new hedgehog.
And everyone loves it.

1:27:37.991 --> 1:27:41.168
I... will... not... try...

1:27:41.343 --> 1:27:44.302
to stop... my...
elders... from...

1:27:44.476 --> 1:27:46.870
destroying... the... world!

1:27:52.528 --> 1:27:54.443
Playtime is over.

1:28:03.147 --> 1:28:05.367
There's no going back now.

1:28:09.545 --> 1:28:11.895
Set up defense.

1:28:13.853 --> 1:28:15.159
Damn you, autocorrect!

1:28:21.034 --> 1:28:22.079
Mantis!

1:28:24.037 --> 1:28:25.300
Oh!

1:28:28.694 --> 1:28:29.782
Whee!

1:28:31.871 --> 1:28:34.483
I'm right here, arach-nerd.

1:28:44.971 --> 1:28:47.713
That's what I call
mantis-scaping.

1:28:47.887 --> 1:28:50.325
That's elder abuse!

1:28:56.418 --> 1:28:59.638
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

1:28:59.812 --> 1:29:01.205
Shadow...

1:29:01.379 --> 1:29:03.990
I see you've chosen betrayal.

1:29:05.165 --> 1:29:07.820
And you were once
so useful to me.

1:29:23.532 --> 1:29:25.708
Ready to recycle some tin cans?

1:29:25.882 --> 1:29:27.492
Just try to keep up.

1:29:58.784 --> 1:30:00.177
Please, Grampsy,

1:30:00.351 --> 1:30:02.092
don't do this!

1:30:02.266 --> 1:30:04.355
Sorry, kiddo.

1:30:04.529 --> 1:30:07.750
Bring Your Grandkid to Work Day
is over.

1:30:13.930 --> 1:30:15.714
Any last words?

1:30:15.888 --> 1:30:18.587
Just one thing...

1:30:19.588 --> 1:30:21.677
that I never thought I'd say.

1:30:21.851 --> 1:30:23.330
What is it?

1:30:23.505 --> 1:30:25.985
"I love you"?

1:30:26.638 --> 1:30:27.944
No.

1:30:28.118 --> 1:30:30.033
It was something even better.

1:30:30.207 --> 1:30:32.296
But I'm not gonna say it if
that's the way you're gonna be.

1:30:32.470 --> 1:30:34.429
Okay. Bye.

1:30:47.311 --> 1:30:49.182
Grandchildren.

1:30:49.356 --> 1:30:52.969
All the fun
and none of the responsibility.

1:30:55.101 --> 1:30:57.887
Who said life was pointless?

1:30:58.670 --> 1:31:01.586
- Huh?
- Oh, right. You did.

1:31:07.418 --> 1:31:08.941
[Knuckles] Victory!

1:31:09.115 --> 1:31:11.466
Say what you want
about my granddad,

1:31:11.640 --> 1:31:13.468
he made one
hell of a bug zapper.

1:31:15.687 --> 1:31:17.515
We got to stop that laser!

1:31:17.689 --> 1:31:19.909
I knew there was something
I was forgetting.

1:31:30.485 --> 1:31:33.662
We're out of time.
The cannon is about to fire!

1:31:33.836 --> 1:31:35.054
Where are you?

1:31:35.228 --> 1:31:37.753
Oh, you know,
just making friends.

1:31:37.927 --> 1:31:39.624
They're all yours.

1:31:48.328 --> 1:31:49.852
Follow me!

1:31:55.945 --> 1:31:58.513
Now, this might hurt a little!

1:32:12.352 --> 1:32:15.138
So this was your plan?

1:32:15.312 --> 1:32:16.835
Yeah...

1:32:17.009 --> 1:32:20.491
Would someone mind shutting
down the giant death ray?

1:32:22.928 --> 1:32:24.756
We can't stop the cannon
from firing...

1:32:24.930 --> 1:32:27.019
But we can steer it away
from the Earth.

1:32:27.193 --> 1:32:29.544
- Coming around to starboard.
- Aye-aye, Doc.

1:32:33.504 --> 1:32:35.550
Here we go.

1:32:36.768 --> 1:32:38.596
[Robotnik] It's a little tight.

1:32:39.379 --> 1:32:41.599
Definitely not power steering.

1:32:47.518 --> 1:32:50.434
Keep... turning.

1:32:53.045 --> 1:32:54.873
Jump in anytime here, guys!

1:33:00.531 --> 1:33:04.361
Can't... hold... much... longer.

1:33:21.987 --> 1:33:23.119
Yes!

1:33:23.293 --> 1:33:25.556
I did it! I did it!

1:33:28.864 --> 1:33:30.561
- Oh!
- Ooh!

1:33:31.214 --> 1:33:32.345
Look what you did!

1:33:32.519 --> 1:33:35.131
- Hey, look down there!
- Sonic!

1:33:41.224 --> 1:33:43.313
Oh, Knuckles,
please tell me you have a...

1:33:43.487 --> 1:33:45.184
Last one.

1:33:45.358 --> 1:33:46.751
Let's make it count.

1:33:49.319 --> 1:33:51.364
Ready for a little base of ball?

1:33:52.409 --> 1:33:54.019
Deep breath.

1:33:54.193 --> 1:33:56.892
One... two... three!

1:34:18.740 --> 1:34:20.872
- Really!
- What's happening?

1:34:21.046 --> 1:34:23.527
The reactor core is overloading.

1:34:23.701 --> 1:34:26.051
It's only a matter of time
before it blows.

1:34:26.225 --> 1:34:27.966
So what does that mean
for Earth?

1:34:28.140 --> 1:34:30.795
A radioactive atmosphere.

1:34:30.969 --> 1:34:33.450
Rain that kills the crops
and melts your flesh.

1:34:33.624 --> 1:34:34.886
Other than that...

1:34:35.060 --> 1:34:36.714
We're not done here!

1:34:36.888 --> 1:34:38.803
You try to stabilize
the reactor.

1:34:38.977 --> 1:34:40.196
Buy me some time.

1:34:40.370 --> 1:34:42.415
I'll push the station
away from Earth

1:34:42.589 --> 1:34:44.026
before it explodes.

1:34:44.200 --> 1:34:48.204
This is our last chance
to do the right thing.

1:34:49.858 --> 1:34:52.469
Go with God

1:34:52.643 --> 1:34:54.863
stinking hedgehog.

1:34:56.125 --> 1:34:58.431
<i>Core integrity failing.</i>

1:35:07.614 --> 1:35:09.268
I've got you, Sonic!

1:35:42.606 --> 1:35:46.001
<i>Initializing
reactor core stabilizers.</i>

1:36:04.715 --> 1:36:07.413
This is Doctor Ivo Robotnik,

1:36:07.587 --> 1:36:10.329
dedicating my final livestream

1:36:10.503 --> 1:36:13.245
to one very special henchman:

1:36:13.855 --> 1:36:15.247
<i>Agent Stone.</i>

1:36:15.421 --> 1:36:17.641
No, no. Doctor, wait!

1:36:17.815 --> 1:36:20.209
<i>If I can't rule the world...</i>

1:36:21.210 --> 1:36:23.038
I might as well save it...

1:36:23.212 --> 1:36:26.345
for the one and only person
who ever cared about me.

1:36:26.519 --> 1:36:28.434
Don't do this, Doctor, please!

1:36:28.608 --> 1:36:32.221
Stone, you were more
than a sycophant to me.

1:36:35.093 --> 1:36:36.355
You were...

1:36:37.835 --> 1:36:39.358
a syco-friend.

1:36:44.929 --> 1:36:48.454
I'll miss your lattes
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

1:36:50.413 --> 1:36:52.284
I love the way you make 'em!

1:37:35.371 --> 1:37:39.201
So... I guess there's
only one thing left to say.

1:37:43.988 --> 1:37:45.468
It's been a real drag.

1:37:46.164 --> 1:37:47.644
Thanks for nothing.

1:38:06.228 --> 1:38:07.403
Sonic, look.

1:38:17.630 --> 1:38:19.502
Shadow and Robotnik.

1:38:19.676 --> 1:38:21.896
They sacrificed themselves...

1:38:22.070 --> 1:38:24.072
to save everyone.

1:38:24.811 --> 1:38:26.857
You always have a choice.

1:38:28.119 --> 1:38:30.861
Guys, I'm really sorry
for running off like that.

1:38:31.035 --> 1:38:32.645
I shouldn't have
left you behind.

1:38:34.430 --> 1:38:36.040
The truth is...

1:38:36.214 --> 1:38:38.869
you're the best teammates
a hedgehog could ever ask for.

1:38:40.610 --> 1:38:42.438
And the best friends.

1:38:42.612 --> 1:38:44.483
Can you ever forgive me?

1:38:48.574 --> 1:38:50.359
Team Sonic?

1:38:54.450 --> 1:38:57.061
How about just "team"?

1:39:05.374 --> 1:39:06.984
Goodbye, Doctor.

1:39:23.522 --> 1:39:25.829
Big finish.[Knuckles] Mmm!

1:39:27.352 --> 1:39:29.789
Now that's what I call teamwork.

1:39:29.964 --> 1:39:31.748
Okay! It's ready!

1:39:34.925 --> 1:39:36.579
Knuckles, how could you?

1:39:36.753 --> 1:39:38.581
Gotta be faster than that!

1:39:39.495 --> 1:39:40.583
Give me a break.

1:39:40.757 --> 1:39:42.063
Still moving a little slow
over here.

1:39:42.237 --> 1:39:44.021
- Donut Lord!
- Yay!

1:39:45.892 --> 1:39:48.547
Okay, Knuckles, that's...
I am having the love.

1:39:48.721 --> 1:39:50.071
I want the love!

1:39:50.245 --> 1:39:52.943
Aww... Get in here, Ozzy.

1:39:53.117 --> 1:39:54.814
It's great to be back together.

1:39:54.989 --> 1:39:56.816
We're stronger than ever.

1:39:56.991 --> 1:39:59.428
And nothing is gonna
stand in our way.

1:40:00.777 --> 1:40:04.607
Except that one piece
of unfinished business.

1:40:13.659 --> 1:40:16.662
And way out in front, to the
surprise of absolutely no one,

1:40:16.836 --> 1:40:18.012
it's the Blue Blur!

1:40:18.186 --> 1:40:19.926
Often imitated,
never duplicated,

1:40:20.101 --> 1:40:21.319
the one, the only...

1:40:22.407 --> 1:40:23.887
Let's do this!

1:40:24.061 --> 1:40:26.237
Yeah!

1:40:26.411 --> 1:40:29.501
All right, boys,
try and keep up.

1:42:25.922 --> 1:42:29.447
Sonic the Hedgehog
is Family Champion once again!

1:42:30.100 --> 1:42:31.145
Tails?

1:42:31.710 --> 1:42:33.234
Knuckles?

1:42:34.887 --> 1:42:37.847
Okay. Yeah, I overshot
the finish line.

1:42:46.769 --> 1:42:49.772
Okay, so how do I get back?

1:43:01.175 --> 1:43:02.263
Pro tip:

1:43:02.437 --> 1:43:03.655
If you're gonna take a shot

1:43:03.829 --> 1:43:05.962
at the fastest creature
in the universe...

1:43:08.312 --> 1:43:09.922
you'd better not miss.

1:43:13.752 --> 1:43:16.364
Um... I'm flattered
by the cosplay,

1:43:16.538 --> 1:43:18.235
but you got a few details wrong.

1:43:18.409 --> 1:43:21.282
I can't blame you, though.
It's hard to copy perfection.

1:43:31.379 --> 1:43:33.381
That's a neat trick.

1:43:45.306 --> 1:43:47.221
What? Who are you?

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.741
I'm right here.

00:00:01.915 --> 00:00:03.482
If you weren't family.

00:00:03.656 --> 00:00:05.484
I could have gut you
like a pheasant.

00:00:05.658 --> 00:00:08.661
I mean. try to keep up.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.451
<i>And now back to
"La UÚltima Pasión."</i>

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:17.017
<i>UÚltima Pasión...</i>

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:20.020
can only belong to one.

00:00:20.194 --> 00:00:21.239
No.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.678
It can only belong... to Juan!

00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:28.246
Gabriella should kill them both.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.901
She's not a prize to be won.

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:33.164
"Kill this. Murder that."

00:00:33.338 --> 00:00:36.733
You need to lighten up. Shadow.
We're about to rule the world.

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:39.039
When we're done...

00:00:39.213 --> 00:00:41.955
there won't be
anything left to rule.

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.741
That is dark. Even for you.

00:00:45.698 --> 00:00:47.265
What are you
and the professor up to?

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.310
Hello! What's this?

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:52.052
I knew I saw an outside signal!

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:54.098
<i>Cheerio!</i>

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:56.230
<i>I guess someone forgot to flush.</i>

00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:20.080
What now. my cunning cohort?

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:21.778
Just a little teamwork!

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:30.874
Hey...

00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:32.919
The lasers...

00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.619
don't seem to be
penetrating my suit.

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:41.014
They're conforming to the
shape of my bodacious bod.

00:01:41.188 --> 00:01:42.625
Of course.

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:46.455
I designed these suits
to create a field

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:48.718
of laser-bending
thermal distortion.

00:01:48.892 --> 00:01:50.807
Wasn't sure it would work
till now.

00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:52.417
You're heartless. son.

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:54.463
- Hmm!
- Rotten to the core.

00:01:54.637 --> 00:01:56.334
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm...

00:01:56.508 --> 00:01:57.727
so proud.

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:00.251
So now we can just dance
right through.

00:02:02.862 --> 00:02:04.951
That sounds like a challenge.

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.565
<i>♪ My finger is on the button ♪</i>

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:54.914
<i>♪ Push the button ♪</i>

00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:13.759
The Robotniks are almost
at the vault!

00:03:13.933 --> 00:03:16.022
We're out of time. I'm going.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.328
No. Sonic!

00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:18.677
I haven't disabled
the traps yet!

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.333
Too late!

00:03:22.507 --> 00:03:25.466
Look at me! I'm running
on the wrong side of the road!

00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:30.297
Well. I got to take in
the sights.

00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:32.517
Paul. John. George.
the other one!

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:34.388
Loud American coming through!

00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:35.999
Excuse me. Pardon me.

00:03:36.173 --> 00:03:37.609
'Ello. guv'nor!
Which way to Hogwarts?

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:39.219
Hear ye. hear ye!

00:03:39.393 --> 00:03:41.570
Sonic the Hedgehog
wants a cuppa tea!

00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:43.397
Hold this for me. please.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.009
You're not gonna make it!

00:03:46.183 --> 00:03:47.184
I can make it.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.102
You're not gonna make it!

00:03:52.276 --> 00:03:53.451
I'm gonna make it.

00:03:55.192 --> 00:03:56.367
I'm not gonna make it.

00:03:56.541 --> 00:03:58.978
I'm not gonna make it!

00:04:03.592 --> 00:04:05.419
- Made it!
- Whoo!

00:04:07.117 --> 00:04:09.119
Excuse me. Coming through.
No time for autographs.

00:04:09.293 --> 00:04:10.337
Got to go. bye!

00:04:17.606 --> 00:04:20.217
Our destiny awaits.

00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:23.133
Stop right there. Roboscum!

00:04:23.307 --> 00:04:25.526
- Let's do this!
- Copy!

00:04:32.838 --> 00:04:34.405
Too slow. Eggmen.

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:37.843
Now if you don't mind.
I've got to get that key.

00:04:38.017 --> 00:04:39.366
Whoa!

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.542
My feet. Why can't I
use my beautiful feet?

00:04:41.717 --> 00:04:43.196
Heh-heh![Rockwell] Because...

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.417
this vault is armed
with variable gravity.

00:04:47.984 --> 00:04:48.811
No kidding.

00:04:48.985 --> 00:04:50.769
Green goes up...

00:04:50.943 --> 00:04:53.119
and red takes you down... hard.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.468
Rockwell. listen to me.

00:04:54.643 --> 00:04:56.427
The Robotniks are planning to...

00:04:56.601 --> 00:04:58.516
Oh. they're planning on stealing
a second key. just like you are?

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.083
Yes. I'm aware.

00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:04.130
I called it the second
Commander Walters was attacked.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.784
So...

00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.526
thank you for taking the bait

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.180
and falling right into my trap.

00:05:10.354 --> 00:05:12.486
I don't believe this.

00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:14.271
I know. grandson.

00:05:14.445 --> 00:05:16.447
A woman in the military!

00:05:18.362 --> 00:05:19.798
Let's go.

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:22.105
Go. positions!

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:23.367
Full perimeter.

00:05:24.934 --> 00:05:26.239
Robotnik.

00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:28.677
Going full spandex. huh?
Who's the fossil?

00:05:28.851 --> 00:05:32.985
That's my grandfather.
you dough-eating dimbecile.

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.249
- Who are they?
- A couple of bleeding hearts.

00:05:36.423 --> 00:05:39.252
here to rescue
their emotional-support animals.

00:05:39.426 --> 00:05:41.211
Enough! It's over.

00:05:41.385 --> 00:05:44.954
The only way you're
leaving here is in handcuffs.

00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:46.825
There is no other way out.

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.785
You know. there might be
one other way out.

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:51.351
And what is that
supposed to mean?

00:05:51.525 --> 00:05:53.440
Hey. big guy.
I think it's time to...

00:05:54.615 --> 00:05:57.923
Break glass
in case of emergency!

00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:08.107
Ha! Nothing can stop
Team Knuckles!

00:06:08.281 --> 00:06:09.369
Open fire!

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.242
Knuckles. turn this stuff off!

00:06:12.416 --> 00:06:13.722
- Hurry!
- On it.

00:06:15.332 --> 00:06:16.420
Uh-oh.

00:06:24.036 --> 00:06:26.386
Ha! See how you like it...

00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:35.961
- Can you move?
- No. not at all.

00:06:36.135 --> 00:06:38.572
- Tails. can you?
- No. I'm stuck.

00:06:38.747 --> 00:06:40.139
We might be here a while.

00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:44.753
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:47.190
Where's the key?

00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:54.327
Whoa!

00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:57.156
- What was that?
- We might have a problem.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.769
No. no. no. no!

00:07:21.485 --> 00:07:23.574
I'm moving.

00:07:24.357 --> 00:07:25.968
I'm moving!

00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:31.582
You go get it. grandson!

00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:33.366
Hey!

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.368
Oh. whoa. whoa...

00:07:37.893 --> 00:07:39.764
No. No. no!

00:07:40.373 --> 00:07:42.071
I'm almost there!

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.683
Whoa!

00:07:50.862 --> 00:07:52.429
Sonic!

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.836
That was so not worth it!

00:08:08.837 --> 00:08:09.968
Ooh!

00:08:13.102 --> 00:08:14.843
- You okay?
- Yeah. You good?

00:08:15.017 --> 00:08:15.756
Sonic!

00:08:15.931 --> 00:08:17.758
Hey.

00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:21.153
Sonic. one.
concrete boulder. zero.

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:23.764
Thanks for the save.

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:25.462
Cutting it a little close.
don't you think?

00:08:26.898 --> 00:08:28.247
Secure the room!

00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:31.468
She's got the key.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.298
I got an idea.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.961
Commander Walters.

00:08:46.135 --> 00:08:47.223
Sir.

00:08:47.397 --> 00:08:49.007
You're... Still alive?

00:08:49.181 --> 00:08:51.967
I'll die before I let that key
fall into the wrong hands.

00:08:52.837 --> 00:08:54.230
Thanks for keeping it safe.

00:08:54.404 --> 00:08:55.884
I'll take it from here.

00:08:58.582 --> 00:09:00.410
That's an order.
Director Rockwell.

00:09:04.109 --> 00:09:06.764
Now. organize
the reinforcements.

00:09:08.113 --> 00:09:09.201
Yes. sir.

00:09:14.946 --> 00:09:17.166
Guys. guys. I got the key.
I repeat. I got the key.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.950
Now let's get out of here.

00:09:23.172 --> 00:09:25.435
Commander Walters.

00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:27.306
No. no. No. Wait!

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.018
What?

00:09:43.192 --> 00:09:45.716
Tom! Everyone's clear!
Come on. let's go!

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.761
You. What are you...

00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:50.503
Tom!

00:09:51.635 --> 00:09:53.680
Tom. Tom. what happened?

00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:55.378
Speak to me. Come on.

00:09:55.552 --> 00:09:57.728
Come on. it's gonna be okay.

00:09:57.902 --> 00:10:00.949
Please. please. please get up.
Hey. come on. please wake up.

00:10:01.123 --> 00:10:02.733
Wake up. wake up. come on.

00:10:03.429 --> 00:10:04.822
Wake up. wake up. wake up!

00:10:05.518 --> 00:10:06.955
Maria.

00:10:11.002 --> 00:10:12.699
What did you do?

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:16.965
What I had to.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.317
Oh. my God. Tom!

00:10:24.537 --> 00:10:26.235
Help me up. kid.

00:10:29.064 --> 00:10:30.369
Freeze! Don't move!

00:10:30.543 --> 00:10:35.418
Any tricks up your sleeve.
Captain Grandtastic?

00:10:42.164 --> 00:10:44.209
We got what we came for.

00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:47.821
Great job. Shadow.

00:10:48.561 --> 00:10:51.434
We have both keys.

00:10:51.608 --> 00:10:54.393
So where's your little
science project?

00:10:55.786 --> 00:10:59.746
It's closer than you think.
my boy.

00:11:01.922 --> 00:11:03.446
Welcome...

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.971
to my masterpiece!

00:11:09.887 --> 00:11:11.628
I must hand it to GUN.

00:11:11.802 --> 00:11:15.240
They built her
to my exact specifications.

00:11:15.414 --> 00:11:16.589
It's...

00:11:18.243 --> 00:11:19.810
remarkable!

00:11:19.984 --> 00:11:21.203
Mm-hmm.

00:11:21.377 --> 00:11:24.206
- Astounding!
- Yes.

00:11:25.337 --> 00:11:27.470
That's my genius grand-genome!

00:11:27.644 --> 00:11:31.256
And I have one more surprise.

00:11:33.737 --> 00:11:37.741
It's a new suit!

00:11:47.316 --> 00:11:48.143
Gee.

00:12:07.684 --> 00:12:10.078
<i>♪ I'm a chip Off the old block ♪</i>

00:12:10.252 --> 00:12:12.341

<i>♪ I'm a chip off

00:12:16.954 --> 00:12:18.869
What do you want. Stone?
I'm busy.

00:12:19.043 --> 00:12:22.046
Doctor. I have a bad feeling
about this.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.180
I don't think your grandfather's
been completely honest with us.

00:12:25.354 --> 00:12:27.051
It was something Shadow said.

00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:29.053
<i>There's more to their plan.</i>

00:12:30.489 --> 00:12:33.536
How dare you!

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.495
You have been jealous
of my long-lost grand-Pop-Tart

00:12:36.669 --> 00:12:38.802
since the very beginning!

00:12:38.976 --> 00:12:41.631
I no longer require
your obsequious groveling.

00:12:41.805 --> 00:12:44.286
<i>Consider this your notice
of termination.</i>

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.854
Your letter of reference
will be L for Loser.

00:12:48.028 --> 00:12:49.856
Of course.
I'll expect you to stay on

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.510
until you've been
successfully cloned.

00:12:51.684 --> 00:12:55.166
But you and I are done!

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.777
Like a blackened catfish dinner!

00:12:57.951 --> 00:13:01.216
Sir. it's too dangerous and
I'm not there to protect you.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.521
I already lost you once! I...

00:13:02.695 --> 00:13:04.828
Unsubscribe.
Blocked and reported.

00:13:06.046 --> 00:13:07.961
I can't lose you again.

00:13:14.403 --> 00:13:15.969
Do the honors...

00:13:16.709 --> 00:13:17.884
grandson.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.105
Here we go.

00:14:55.373 --> 00:14:57.114
It'll be okay. Sonic.

00:14:57.288 --> 00:14:58.942
It'll be okay?

00:14:59.116 --> 00:15:01.640
Tom is fighting for his life
and you think it'll be okay?

00:15:01.814 --> 00:15:05.035
The fox is simply trying
to comfort you.

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:07.080
Comfort's not
what I need right now.

00:15:07.255 --> 00:15:10.388
I need to stop them.
By any means necessary.

00:15:10.562 --> 00:15:11.737
Wait. you don't mean...

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:14.000
The Master Emerald.

00:15:14.174 --> 00:15:17.352
The Emerald must never be
wielded for vengeance.

00:15:17.526 --> 00:15:18.570
Not ever!

00:15:18.744 --> 00:15:20.398
We swore a sacred oath.

00:15:20.572 --> 00:15:22.531
Don't talk to me about oaths.
Not now!

00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:24.576
But you told Tom
using the Emerald

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.186
wasn't the right choice.

00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:28.450
Well. now it's the only choice.

00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:30.408
And if neither of you
have the guts to help me.

00:15:30.582 --> 00:15:32.018
then I'll do it alone.

00:15:32.192 --> 00:15:34.282
But I thought the
three of us were a team.

00:15:34.456 --> 00:15:36.458
I thought that's what
made us special.

00:15:36.632 --> 00:15:38.416
I'm not asking you twice.
Knuckles.

00:15:39.287 --> 00:15:42.115
Where is the Master Emerald?

00:15:43.856 --> 00:15:47.207
Your heart is being consumed
by anger. hedgehog.

00:15:47.382 --> 00:15:50.428
You are in no condition
to make decisions right now.

00:15:50.602 --> 00:15:53.170
I know you're upset about Tom.
We all are.

00:15:53.344 --> 00:15:55.041
Last chance.

00:15:55.215 --> 00:15:57.827
Where... is it?

00:15:58.393 --> 00:15:59.916
Don't do this.

00:16:06.575 --> 00:16:09.534
Part of our oath
is to trust each other.

00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:11.928
And I must abide
by that promise.

00:16:12.102 --> 00:16:14.409
even if you have chosen
to break it.

00:16:14.583 --> 00:16:16.324
But heed this warning:

00:16:16.498 --> 00:16:19.849
The Master Emerald is guarded
by a fearsome warrior.

00:16:20.023 --> 00:16:22.199
And to seize
this ultimate power.

00:16:22.373 --> 00:16:24.288
you will have to go...

00:16:24.462 --> 00:16:26.508
through him.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.599
Okay. Wade...
all comes down to this.

00:16:31.339 --> 00:16:32.992
Last few seconds.

00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:34.298
Whipple down the ice.

00:16:34.472 --> 00:16:37.997
He shoots... he scores!

00:16:38.171 --> 00:16:41.218
Wade Whipple
is a champion again!

00:16:47.137 --> 00:16:50.314
Oh. hey. Sonic. See my goal?
Pretty sick. right?

00:16:50.488 --> 00:16:52.316
I'm here for the Emerald.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.013
Look. Sonic. I'm sorry.

00:16:54.187 --> 00:16:56.364
I promised to guard this emerald
with my life.

00:16:56.538 --> 00:16:58.366
I will do whatever it takes...

00:16:59.497 --> 00:17:00.585
Well. I tried.

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:07.026
Sonic!

00:17:10.943 --> 00:17:11.944
Too bright!

00:17:15.557 --> 00:17:18.603
<i>This is an urgent
national emergency broadcast.</i>

00:17:18.777 --> 00:17:21.214
<i>A spacecraft designed
by the agency GUN</i>

00:17:21.389 --> 00:17:24.304
<i>has been hijacked and launched
out of the River Thames.</i>

00:17:30.093 --> 00:17:33.139
<i>All residents are urged
to seek immediate shelter.</i>

00:17:55.205 --> 00:17:57.468
It's time. Shadow.

00:17:59.122 --> 00:18:03.213
Professor. is this really
what Maria would have wanted?

00:18:05.998 --> 00:18:09.349
The question isn't
what Maria would have wanted.

00:18:10.481 --> 00:18:12.483
It's what do they deserve.

00:18:13.484 --> 00:18:15.965
Remember what she meant to us.

00:18:17.836 --> 00:18:20.752
Remember what they took from us.

00:18:31.197 --> 00:18:32.242
Kids!

00:18:32.416 --> 00:18:34.331
We have to go. now!

00:18:39.554 --> 00:18:41.991
They want to take
Shadow away from us. Maria!

00:18:50.608 --> 00:18:53.306
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
Those are children.

00:18:53.481 --> 00:18:55.265
- We've got our orders. Walters!
- Stand down!

00:19:19.115 --> 00:19:20.333
Huh?

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.988
Maria!

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.473
Excuse me. Grand Paso Doble.

00:20:13.648 --> 00:20:16.607
What is that thermonuclear
gerbil doing?

00:20:16.781 --> 00:20:19.131
Infusing the core...

00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:20.785
with chaos energy.

00:20:20.959 --> 00:20:23.571
That's my little secret.

00:20:23.745 --> 00:20:26.356
The Eclipse Cannon
is about to turn this planet

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.315
into a flaming pile of rubble.

00:20:29.489 --> 00:20:34.320
wiping out everything
in a 25.000-mile radius.

00:20:37.497 --> 00:20:39.674
Including us.

00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:44.853
What?

00:20:45.767 --> 00:20:48.857
We can't annihilate the Earth!

00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:53.470
- Hmm?
- By combining our genius. we can rule humanity.

00:20:53.644 --> 00:20:54.558
Together!

00:20:54.732 --> 00:20:57.822
Humanity is a failed experiment.

00:20:57.996 --> 00:21:00.216
If anyone should know that.
it's you.

00:21:01.957 --> 00:21:04.873
All your life. you've been
rejected by this world.

00:21:05.743 --> 00:21:07.397
You have nothing down there.

00:21:09.007 --> 00:21:11.053
No one who cares about you.

00:21:12.837 --> 00:21:14.404
But I have you now.

00:21:17.102 --> 00:21:18.495
We're family.

00:21:19.409 --> 00:21:21.019
We have each other.

00:21:22.499 --> 00:21:23.761
Oh. Ivo...

00:21:25.589 --> 00:21:27.286
you're no Maria.

00:21:30.638 --> 00:21:34.598
The moment I lost her.
my family was gone forever!

00:21:36.252 --> 00:21:37.993
The only way to give
Maria's life meaning

00:21:38.167 --> 00:21:40.430
is to destroy the world
that took her from me.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.433
So I'm burning it all down!

00:21:46.131 --> 00:21:47.306
It's done.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.787
Good work. Shadow.

00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:51.833
I'm prepping
the firing sequence.

00:21:52.007 --> 00:21:55.880
The weapon will be fully charged
in ten minutes.

00:21:59.841 --> 00:22:01.930
It's almost finished. Maria.

00:22:02.844 --> 00:22:05.194
You will have justice.

00:22:09.589 --> 00:22:10.895
What is that?

00:22:11.809 --> 00:22:14.769
Is GUN launching missiles at us?

00:22:14.943 --> 00:22:17.989
Impossible.
It's moving too fast.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.733
It's him.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:35.528
You hurt my family.
This ends now!

00:22:35.703 --> 00:22:37.400
Now you know my anger.

00:22:37.574 --> 00:22:40.446
The pain I've felt for 50 years.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.885
And you've made
the same choice I did.

00:22:44.059 --> 00:22:45.625
I'm nothing like you!

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.888
We'll see.

00:22:54.722 --> 00:22:56.332
Show yourself. coward!

00:23:28.146 --> 00:23:29.800
You were right about one thing.

00:23:31.671 --> 00:23:34.022
This ends now.

00:24:00.613 --> 00:24:01.658
What's happening?

00:24:01.832 --> 00:24:02.964
Where are they?

00:24:04.008 --> 00:24:05.270
- Up there.
- Where?

00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:06.358
- Higher.
- Hmm?

00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:09.361
Left yourself open.

00:24:09.535 --> 00:24:11.320
Ivo! What are you doing?

00:24:11.494 --> 00:24:12.887
Thwarting your evil plan!

00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:25.769
- Not the mustache!
- Agreed.

00:24:25.943 --> 00:24:28.641
Let go on three.
One. two. three!

00:24:33.821 --> 00:24:37.085
Oh... a nano-fist.

00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:40.958
I haven't seen that since I
hate-watched <i>Green Lantern</i> in 2011.

00:24:41.132 --> 00:24:43.091
I was saving it for Comic-Con.

00:24:43.265 --> 00:24:45.310
But now there won't
be a Comic-Con!

00:25:07.942 --> 00:25:10.988
Why are you alone?
Where are your friends?

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.253
They tried to stop you.
didn't they?

00:25:15.427 --> 00:25:16.907
But you came anyway.

00:25:17.081 --> 00:25:19.518
Your anger was too much.

00:25:19.692 --> 00:25:22.434
What kind of hero
abandons his friends

00:25:22.608 --> 00:25:24.654
to pursue revenge?

00:25:24.828 --> 00:25:27.135
Abandons his family!

00:25:27.309 --> 00:25:29.920
Don't you dare talk
about my family.

00:25:30.094 --> 00:25:32.836
And here I thought
you cared for them.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.144
Especially the one...
What's his name?

00:25:36.318 --> 00:25:37.536
Tom?

00:26:03.911 --> 00:26:06.304
Go ahead. Finish it!

00:26:08.002 --> 00:26:10.352
What are you waiting for? Do it!

00:26:10.526 --> 00:26:13.094
I'm right here!

00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:16.401
You didn't let your pain
change who you are...

00:26:17.837 --> 00:26:18.882
in here.

00:26:27.325 --> 00:26:29.284
This is not who I am.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.634
What are you doing?

00:26:31.808 --> 00:26:34.680
You won. Take your revenge.

00:26:36.552 --> 00:26:38.684
There are no winners
with revenge.

00:26:52.002 --> 00:26:53.743
<i>Wow.</i>

00:26:53.917 --> 00:26:55.353
Look at all those stars.

00:26:56.833 --> 00:26:58.443
<i>They're like diamonds.</i>

00:27:00.706 --> 00:27:04.058
The last time I sat
beneath stars like this...

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.626
I was with her.

00:27:09.193 --> 00:27:11.717
I've felt this pain for so long.

00:27:13.415 --> 00:27:15.112
It's all I know.

00:27:15.286 --> 00:27:17.506
When I lost Longclaw...

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.377
I felt the same way.

00:27:21.162 --> 00:27:23.599
Did your pain eventually
go away?

00:27:23.773 --> 00:27:25.731
No.

00:27:25.905 --> 00:27:27.820
But in time.
I learned there's something

00:27:27.995 --> 00:27:30.301
even more powerful than pain.

00:27:30.475 --> 00:27:32.564
The love we felt for each other.

00:27:33.783 --> 00:27:35.611
That's what you need
to hold on to. Shadow.

00:27:35.785 --> 00:27:38.005
Maria might be gone.

00:27:38.179 --> 00:27:40.181
but your love
will always remain.

00:27:54.847 --> 00:27:58.851
"The light shines
even though the star is gone."

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.604
This whole mess is my fault.

00:28:12.778 --> 00:28:15.607
I've been so blinded by rage.
I thought...

00:28:16.304 --> 00:28:18.088
I had no choice.

00:28:21.613 --> 00:28:24.007
You always have a choice.

00:28:28.968 --> 00:28:31.710
But making the right one
is never easy.

00:28:31.884 --> 00:28:33.582
One more thing I learned

00:28:33.756 --> 00:28:36.541
is that when you
really screw something up.

00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.195
you can't fix it on your own.

00:28:53.384 --> 00:28:55.038
Gotta go fast.

00:28:55.212 --> 00:28:57.562
Don't tell me you've
got a catchphrase.

00:28:57.736 --> 00:29:01.088
That's right. new hedgehog.
And everyone loves it.

00:29:16.842 --> 00:29:20.019
I... will... not... try...

00:29:20.194 --> 00:29:23.153
to stop... my...
elders... from...

00:29:23.327 --> 00:29:25.721
destroying... the... world!

00:29:31.379 --> 00:29:33.294
Playtime is over.

00:29:41.998 --> 00:29:44.218
There's no going back now.

00:29:48.396 --> 00:29:50.746
Set up defense.

00:29:52.704 --> 00:29:54.010
Damn you. autocorrect!

00:29:59.885 --> 00:30:00.930
Mantis!

00:30:02.888 --> 00:30:04.151
Oh!

00:30:07.545 --> 00:30:08.633
Whee!

00:30:10.722 --> 00:30:13.334
I'm right here. arach-nerd.

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:26.564
That's what I call
mantis-scaping.

00:30:26.738 --> 00:30:29.176
That's elder abuse!

00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:38.489
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

00:30:38.663 --> 00:30:40.056
Shadow...

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.841
I see you've chosen betrayal.

00:30:44.016 --> 00:30:46.671
And you were once
so useful to me.

00:31:02.383 --> 00:31:04.559
Ready to recycle some tin cans?

00:31:04.733 --> 00:31:06.343
Just try to keep up.

00:31:37.635 --> 00:31:39.028
Please. Grampsy.

00:31:39.202 --> 00:31:40.943
don't do this!

00:31:41.117 --> 00:31:43.206
Sorry. kiddo.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.601
Bring Your Grandkid to Work Day
is over.

00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:54.565
Any last words?

00:31:54.739 --> 00:31:57.438
Just one thing...

00:31:58.439 --> 00:32:00.528
that I never thought I'd say.

00:32:00.702 --> 00:32:02.181
What is it?

00:32:02.356 --> 00:32:04.836
"I love you"?

00:32:05.489 --> 00:32:06.795
No.

00:32:06.969 --> 00:32:08.884
It was something even better.

00:32:09.058 --> 00:32:11.147
But I'm not gonna say it if
that's the way you're gonna be.

00:32:11.321 --> 00:32:13.280
Okay. Bye.

00:32:26.162 --> 00:32:28.033
Grandchildren.

00:32:28.207 --> 00:32:31.820
All the fun
and none of the responsibility.

00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:36.738
Who said life was pointless?

00:32:37.521 --> 00:32:40.437
- Huh?
- Oh. right. You did.

00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:47.792
[Knuckles] Victory!

00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:50.317
Say what you want
about my granddad.

00:32:50.491 --> 00:32:52.319
he made one
hell of a bug zapper.

00:32:54.538 --> 00:32:56.366
We got to stop that laser!

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.760
I knew there was something
I was forgetting.

00:33:09.336 --> 00:33:12.513
We're out of time.
The cannon is about to fire!

00:33:12.687 --> 00:33:13.905
Where are you?

00:33:14.079 --> 00:33:16.604
Oh. you know.
just making friends.

00:33:16.778 --> 00:33:18.475
They're all yours.

00:33:27.179 --> 00:33:28.703
Follow me!

00:33:34.796 --> 00:33:37.364
Now. this might hurt a little!

00:33:51.203 --> 00:33:53.989
So this was your plan?

00:33:54.163 --> 00:33:55.686
Yeah...

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.342
Would someone mind shutting
down the giant death ray?

00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:03.607
We can't stop the cannon
from firing...

00:34:03.781 --> 00:34:05.870
But we can steer it away
from the Earth.

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:08.395
- Coming around to starboard.
- Aye-aye. Doc.

00:34:12.355 --> 00:34:14.401
Here we go.

00:34:15.619 --> 00:34:17.447
[Robotnik] It's a little tight.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.450
Definitely not power steering.

00:34:26.369 --> 00:34:29.285
Keep... turning.

00:34:31.896 --> 00:34:33.724
Jump in anytime here. guys!

00:34:39.382 --> 00:34:43.212
Can't... hold... much... longer.

00:35:00.838 --> 00:35:01.970
Yes!

00:35:02.144 --> 00:35:04.407
I did it! I did it!

00:35:07.715 --> 00:35:09.412
- Oh!
- Ooh!

00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:11.196
Look what you did!

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.982
- Hey. look down there!
- Sonic!

00:35:20.075 --> 00:35:22.164
Oh. Knuckles.
please tell me you have a...

00:35:22.338 --> 00:35:24.035
Last one.

00:35:24.209 --> 00:35:25.602
Let's make it count.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.215
Ready for a little base of ball?

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.870
Deep breath.

00:35:33.044 --> 00:35:35.743
One... two... three!

00:35:57.591 --> 00:35:59.723
- Really!
- What's happening?

00:35:59.897 --> 00:36:02.378
The reactor core is overloading.

00:36:02.552 --> 00:36:04.902
It's only a matter of time
before it blows.

00:36:05.076 --> 00:36:06.817
So what does that mean
for Earth?

00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:09.646
A radioactive atmosphere.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.301
Rain that kills the crops
and melts your flesh.

00:36:12.475 --> 00:36:13.737
Other than that...

00:36:13.911 --> 00:36:15.565
We're not done here!

00:36:15.739 --> 00:36:17.654
You try to stabilize
the reactor.

00:36:17.828 --> 00:36:19.047
Buy me some time.

00:36:19.221 --> 00:36:21.266
I'll push the station
away from Earth

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.877
before it explodes.

00:36:23.051 --> 00:36:27.055
This is our last chance
to do the right thing.

00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:31.320
Go with God

00:36:31.494 --> 00:36:33.714
stinking hedgehog.

00:36:34.976 --> 00:36:37.282
<i>Core integrity failing.</i>

00:36:46.465 --> 00:36:48.119
I've got you. Sonic!

00:37:21.457 --> 00:37:24.852
<i>Initializing
reactor core stabilizers.</i>

00:37:43.566 --> 00:37:46.264
This is Doctor Ivo Robotnik.

00:37:46.438 --> 00:37:49.180
dedicating my final livestream

00:37:49.354 --> 00:37:52.096
to one very special henchman:

00:37:52.706 --> 00:37:54.098
<i>Agent Stone.</i>

00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:56.492
No. no. Doctor. wait!

00:37:56.666 --> 00:37:59.060
<i>If I can't rule the world...</i>

00:38:00.061 --> 00:38:01.889
I might as well save it...

00:38:02.063 --> 00:38:05.196
for the one and only person
who ever cared about me.

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.285
Don't do this. Doctor. please!

00:38:07.459 --> 00:38:11.072
Stone. you were more
than a sycophant to me.

00:38:13.944 --> 00:38:15.206
You were...

00:38:16.686 --> 00:38:18.209
a syco-friend.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.305
I'll miss your lattes
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

00:38:29.264 --> 00:38:31.135
I love the way you make 'em!

00:39:14.222 --> 00:39:18.052
So... I guess there's
only one thing left to say.

00:39:22.839 --> 00:39:24.319
It's been a real drag.

00:39:25.015 --> 00:39:26.495
Thanks for nothing.

00:39:45.079 --> 00:39:46.254
Sonic. look.

00:39:56.481 --> 00:39:58.353
Shadow and Robotnik.

00:39:58.527 --> 00:40:00.747
They sacrificed themselves...

00:40:00.921 --> 00:40:02.923
to save everyone.

00:40:03.662 --> 00:40:05.708
You always have a choice.

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:09.712
Guys. I'm really sorry
for running off like that.

00:40:09.886 --> 00:40:11.496
I shouldn't have
left you behind.

00:40:13.281 --> 00:40:14.891
The truth is...

00:40:15.065 --> 00:40:17.720
you're the best teammates
a hedgehog could ever ask for.

00:40:19.461 --> 00:40:21.289
And the best friends.

00:40:21.463 --> 00:40:23.334
Can you ever forgive me?

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:29.210
Team Sonic?

00:40:33.301 --> 00:40:35.912
How about just "team"?

00:40:44.225 --> 00:40:45.835
Goodbye. Doctor.

00:41:02.373 --> 00:41:04.680
Big finish.[Knuckles] Mmm!

00:41:06.203 --> 00:41:08.640
Now that's what I call teamwork.

00:41:08.815 --> 00:41:10.599
Okay! It's ready!

00:41:13.776 --> 00:41:15.430
Knuckles. how could you?

00:41:15.604 --> 00:41:17.432
Gotta be faster than that!

00:41:18.346 --> 00:41:19.434
Give me a break.

00:41:19.608 --> 00:41:20.914
Still moving a little slow
over here.

00:41:21.088 --> 00:41:22.872
- Donut Lord!
- Yay!

00:41:24.743 --> 00:41:27.398
Okay. Knuckles. that's...
I am having the love.

00:41:27.572 --> 00:41:28.922
I want the love!

00:41:29.096 --> 00:41:31.794
Aww... Get in here. Ozzy.

00:41:31.968 --> 00:41:33.665
It's great to be back together.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.667
We're stronger than ever.

00:41:35.842 --> 00:41:38.279
And nothing is gonna
stand in our way.

00:41:39.628 --> 00:41:43.458
Except that one piece
of unfinished business.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.513
And way out in front. to the
surprise of absolutely no one.

00:41:55.687 --> 00:41:56.863
it's the Blue Blur!

00:41:57.037 --> 00:41:58.777
Often imitated.
never duplicated.

00:41:58.952 --> 00:42:00.170
the one. the only...

00:42:01.258 --> 00:42:02.738
Let's do this!

00:42:02.912 --> 00:42:05.088
Yeah!

00:42:05.262 --> 00:42:08.352
All right. boys.
try and keep up.

00:44:04.773 --> 00:44:08.298
Sonic the Hedgehog
is Family Champion once again!

00:44:08.951 --> 00:44:09.996
Tails?

00:44:10.561 --> 00:44:12.085
Knuckles?

00:44:13.738 --> 00:44:16.698
Okay. Yeah. I overshot
the finish line.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:28.623
Okay. so how do I get back?

00:44:40.026 --> 00:44:41.114
Pro tip:

00:44:41.288 --> 00:44:42.506
If you're gonna take a shot

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.813
at the fastest creature
in the universe...

00:44:47.163 --> 00:44:48.773
you'd better not miss.

00:44:52.603 --> 00:44:55.215
Um... I'm flattered
by the cosplay.

00:44:55.389 --> 00:44:57.086
but you got a few details wrong.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.133
I can't blame you. though.
It's hard to copy perfection.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:12.232
That's a neat trick.

00:45:24.157 --> 00:45:26.072
What? Who are you?

WEBVTT

01:36.406 --> 01:37.656
"Thalapathy"

01:41.198 --> 01:42.323
"Thalapathy"

01:44.156 --> 01:45.281
"His entry spells power"

01:45.323 --> 01:47.239
"Who is our master?
Commander...!"

02:11.534 --> 02:13.075
Mother

02:16.867 --> 02:18.242
'Appa...!'

02:28.659 --> 02:30.200
'Let's kill this boy also, partner'

02:30.242 --> 02:33.242
If we burn all the evidence
we will be the prime suspects

02:33.284 --> 02:35.617
'We need a witness
to speak in our favor'

02:35.659 --> 02:37.034
All that is fine

02:37.075 --> 02:40.784
Just like his father, what if he also
makes trouble insisting on being truthful?

02:41.075 --> 02:42.575
Let's find out right away

02:42.909 --> 02:44.825
Hey boy
What's your name?

02:45.354 --> 02:46.937
- Bhavani
- Huh?

02:47.909 --> 02:48.825
Bhavani

02:48.867 --> 02:50.492
How did your parents die?

02:53.450 --> 02:55.492
They were burnt to death
in a gas explosion

02:55.534 --> 02:57.159
[loud laughter]

02:59.534 --> 03:01.117
He sure knows to survive, I say

03:01.200 --> 03:02.909
After we use him as a witness

03:02.950 --> 03:05.659
...let us complain against him
for stealing our union funds

03:05.700 --> 03:07.284
'His father is Lorry Union leader'

03:07.325 --> 03:10.034
If we claim his son stole union cash
will anyone believe that story?

03:10.075 --> 03:11.992
Sudden show of mercy, huh?

03:12.075 --> 03:13.992
He's so young, that's why

03:14.034 --> 03:15.992
Hey boy, listen

03:16.950 --> 03:19.784
I'll send you to a place where boys
like you are well looked after

03:19.825 --> 03:21.617
Will you go there?

03:23.867 --> 03:26.909
'Govt Juvenile Observation Home
Nagercoil, Kallakurichi'

03:28.825 --> 03:31.950
'That boy shouldn't sleep
even one night in peace'

03:31.992 --> 03:33.867
I've given you more than
what you asked

03:33.909 --> 03:34.992
Thank you, brother

03:35.034 --> 03:38.409
If there's any kind of foul play
Esakki will hunt you down and kill you

03:38.450 --> 03:40.034
- Keep an eye
- I'll take care, bro

03:46.284 --> 03:47.409
'Hey! Come'

03:47.992 --> 03:49.742
'What are you glaring at him for?'

03:53.617 --> 03:56.742
Hey! You want the luxury of sleep, huh?

04:01.534 --> 04:02.659
What are you looking at?

04:02.700 --> 04:03.992
Wipe it

04:04.034 --> 04:05.325
Wipe my boots

04:07.200 --> 04:08.825
Pickle you to pieces, rascal!

04:12.575 --> 04:14.409
'All of you, move aside'

04:27.117 --> 04:29.700
Hey you! Can't hit you more than this

04:30.117 --> 04:31.117
Standing

04:31.159 --> 04:33.034
Standing so still
least bit affected!

04:33.075 --> 04:35.867
You are hitting me mercilessly
because someone is paying you

04:35.950 --> 04:39.075
I have to pay you much more
to make you stop hitting me

04:39.807 --> 04:41.948
I am penniless
Hit me all you want

04:42.012 --> 04:43.596
When I have the money

04:43.621 --> 04:45.038
I'll call you then

04:53.398 --> 04:54.981
[phone ringing]

05:00.390 --> 05:01.765
- Who is this?
- 'Brother'

05:01.807 --> 05:03.765
'That boy Bhavani has escaped from jail'

05:03.807 --> 05:06.098
Scumbag! Is this why
I'm spending so lavishly?

05:06.973 --> 05:10.057
I'll deal with you in person
Find him before daybreak

05:11.307 --> 05:12.307
Scuzzbag!

05:26.098 --> 05:27.390
'Don't worry, anna'

05:27.432 --> 05:28.890
I won't harm you

05:28.973 --> 05:32.515
'If I had wanted to, I could have easily
slit your neck when you were asleep'

05:32.598 --> 05:35.765
But I can't be on the run
throughout my life

05:35.890 --> 05:38.265
I came here to request you
to let me lead a normal life

05:38.307 --> 05:39.557
I don't understand

05:42.223 --> 05:43.432
Let me live my own life

05:43.515 --> 05:45.807
What do I gain by releasing you, huh?

05:45.973 --> 05:48.057
Give me a chance
for just this 1 week

05:48.223 --> 05:51.057
I'll give you half of
what I earn this week

05:51.098 --> 05:52.723
'Whichever week I don't pay you'

05:52.765 --> 05:54.890
...stab me on that same day
at that same spot

05:55.182 --> 05:57.182
Fine, I'll take a chance on you

05:57.376 --> 05:59.376
This week is yours, go

06:02.223 --> 06:05.723
How much do you usually pay for a lorry
to cross the check post without a permit?

06:05.765 --> 06:08.598
Only if you cough up Rs 1000 per lorry
you'll be allowed to pass

06:08.640 --> 06:10.348
I'll get the permit slip

06:10.390 --> 06:12.057
Rs 1000 is yours to keep

06:12.265 --> 06:13.973
I want Rs 100 per lorry

06:14.307 --> 06:16.015
If the policemen hassle us?

06:18.890 --> 06:20.390
That's my responsibility

06:29.932 --> 06:32.432
What, I say?
What do you want?

06:44.973 --> 06:47.098
'2002-2003
Register'

06:55.807 --> 06:57.307
Go...go

06:59.515 --> 07:00.765
Move...move

07:01.598 --> 07:02.640
Come, quick

07:02.682 --> 07:04.140
Hey! Wait...wait

07:04.848 --> 07:06.015
Hurry up

07:10.973 --> 07:13.473
If you want the permit slip in your hand

07:13.598 --> 07:15.723
I must get Rs 500 per lorry

07:17.390 --> 07:18.390
Got it?

07:41.557 --> 07:42.640
Whether I'm here or not

07:42.682 --> 07:45.307
...ensure the boys get
their share of booze and fag

07:49.973 --> 07:51.348
'Govt Reformatory'

08:20.057 --> 08:22.682
In a way, only we are
responsible for all this, partner

08:22.765 --> 08:26.015
When we killed his father
we should have burnt him to ashes too

08:26.223 --> 08:31.432
Now he has the gall to contest as head
in the Lorry Drivers' Union Election

08:32.640 --> 08:34.557
How did he amass
this much wealth, bro?

08:35.598 --> 08:39.265
Logu, do you know how many
lorries run under his control?

08:39.932 --> 08:42.182
On top of it, he owns a meat factory

08:42.223 --> 08:43.682
He is into exports too

08:43.890 --> 08:46.640
All this is common news, partner

08:46.973 --> 08:49.265
These boys in the reformatory
for juvenile delinquents

08:49.307 --> 08:52.057
'He uses them to do something
That's where the money flows in'

08:52.098 --> 08:55.057
Some even say he plays proxy
to a minister to launder his money

08:55.265 --> 08:58.182
If he wins this year's Union election

08:59.098 --> 09:02.223
...he will stoop to any level
to avenge his father's murder

09:02.765 --> 09:05.432
Doesn't make sense to spare him
beyond this stage, partner

09:17.973 --> 09:19.265
Talk of the devil!

09:19.307 --> 09:20.723
Close his chapter

09:42.432 --> 09:45.015
Hello, my dear boy
Hindu, Muslim, Christian

09:45.057 --> 09:47.473
You seem to have the charms
of all the Gods around your neck

09:47.515 --> 09:49.265
Each sect endorses
a particular God

09:49.348 --> 09:51.348
One God will save me
when I'm in danger

09:51.432 --> 09:52.723
Minimum guarantee

09:52.765 --> 09:53.807
Philosophy?

09:54.473 --> 09:59.140
Is this the same chap who pleaded
when he was 17 to spare his life?

10:01.682 --> 10:03.765
We need to discuss something
very important with you

10:03.807 --> 10:06.015
You were paying us
on a weekly basis all these years

10:06.057 --> 10:07.348
You can stop it

10:07.473 --> 10:10.473
Instead you can sell all your assets

10:10.515 --> 10:12.932
'Go and earn a living
somewhere outside India'

10:13.223 --> 10:15.223
I felt the same and
wanted to tell you next week

10:15.265 --> 10:16.765
'For how long?
That too every week'

10:16.807 --> 10:19.098
How can I pay tax to you
to ensure my life is not at risk?

10:19.140 --> 10:21.223
That's why I've decided
to stop payment

10:22.432 --> 10:25.640
That decision isn't yours to take, scumbag!

10:25.723 --> 10:27.682
'Just zip your lips
and obey our orders'

10:27.723 --> 10:29.473
I will do only what I feel is right

10:29.515 --> 10:30.682
Hey...dai!

10:31.015 --> 10:33.348
I am well aware of
how dirty your hands are

10:33.682 --> 10:36.015
Making those boys surrender
for the crimes you commit

10:36.057 --> 10:38.598
'Instigating them to kill
We know about all your offenses'

10:38.682 --> 10:41.182
Don't show off your temerity
Just tuck your tail and scoot

10:41.598 --> 10:44.140
Otherwise you will meet your death
in our hands, watch it

10:44.182 --> 10:46.182
[mocking laughter]

10:47.057 --> 10:48.390
[imitating laughter]

10:48.432 --> 10:50.682
Look around you
This is my area

10:50.723 --> 10:51.890
'If I set my heart on it'

10:51.932 --> 10:53.598
Only your lorry will move from here

10:53.640 --> 10:54.682
Not you

10:54.723 --> 10:58.848
I think you are unable to differentiate
working for money and for gratitude?

10:58.890 --> 11:00.765
Shall I show you a sample?

11:04.265 --> 11:07.182
Listen! We have an important
work to do, come here

11:07.973 --> 11:09.432
'He is calling us, come'

11:11.015 --> 11:13.265
- 'Bhavani, da
- Why is he calling us suddenly?'

11:15.682 --> 11:19.432
Whoever kills these 3 men
in this spot will be rewarded

11:19.682 --> 11:20.973
With a prize money

11:22.390 --> 11:23.765
2 million

11:23.890 --> 11:26.015
[burst of amused laughter]

11:28.598 --> 11:30.890
'Do you realize where you are
and what you are blabbering?'

11:30.932 --> 11:32.765
You think I work for anna
with money as motive?

11:32.807 --> 11:34.307
We go back a long way, da

11:34.348 --> 11:36.390
- 3 million
- If you raise it 50%?

11:36.432 --> 11:38.390
- 'He is like my own brother'
- 4 million

11:38.432 --> 11:40.765
Why are you keeping quiet
when he's so arrogant, bro?

11:40.807 --> 11:41.890
Just say 'yes'
I'll kill him-

11:41.932 --> 11:43.015
5 million!

11:44.932 --> 11:47.015
- How dare you rattle off?
- 6 million

11:47.057 --> 11:48.515
Hey! Kill him now

11:48.557 --> 11:51.015
Wait...let us hear our brother out!!

11:51.811 --> 11:53.186
7 million

11:53.348 --> 11:54.973
Wait...wait, bro

11:55.015 --> 11:57.890
I'll go up to the gate and
make sure no one enters this area

11:57.932 --> 11:59.682
- 8 million
- Whaaaat?

11:59.723 --> 12:00.890
Move aside

12:04.390 --> 12:06.307
Then shall we lock
the deal for 8 million?

12:06.348 --> 12:07.598
- Okay, bro
- Are you ready?

12:07.640 --> 12:10.390
We will divide 8 million equally
I'll deal with these 3 men

12:15.348 --> 12:18.598
Now do you know the difference
between greed and gratitude?

12:20.223 --> 12:21.515
Bro, chopper

12:27.973 --> 12:29.140
I don't need this

12:29.432 --> 12:30.932
I'll give you 2 minutes

12:30.973 --> 12:32.473
Kill me if you can

12:34.682 --> 12:35.848
And save yourself

12:52.223 --> 12:53.265
Hey!

12:55.765 --> 12:56.807
Hey!

13:31.307 --> 13:32.348
These boys?

13:32.723 --> 13:33.807
Yes, sir

13:35.182 --> 13:37.723
Post mortem matches the crime scene?

13:37.807 --> 13:39.348
They have done a neat job, sir

13:39.390 --> 13:42.057
Not knowing to drive
they ran over a man

13:42.098 --> 13:43.348
You expect me to buy this?

13:43.390 --> 13:44.973
'Whom are you trying to trick?'

13:45.015 --> 13:47.057
Sir, I'm not a professional driver

13:47.098 --> 13:49.265
I thought I'll try my hand
But turned out fatal

13:49.307 --> 13:50.682
- Right?
- Yes, sir

13:51.848 --> 13:54.265
- 'Do they have a past history?'
- Yes, sir

13:54.307 --> 13:55.765
Pickpocket case, 511

13:55.807 --> 13:58.223
Then 6 months they were in
a Govt reformatory

13:58.265 --> 14:00.390
Now they are in IPC 302
Punished for murder

14:00.432 --> 14:01.765
Is this a reformatory?

14:01.807 --> 14:03.515
Or a criminal training center?

14:03.723 --> 14:06.973
Why do you need this reformatory
that turns a thief into a murderer?

14:07.307 --> 14:09.848
- Call the Observation home staff
- Okay, sir

14:09.890 --> 14:11.432
Sir, he's calling you

14:12.886 --> 14:15.223
Good afternoon, sir
I am the superintendent here

14:15.265 --> 14:18.182
Forget the introduction, when do you
intend employing a regular master?

14:18.223 --> 14:21.140
The boys drive away
any master we appoint

14:21.182 --> 14:23.932
Actually scared of them,
no teacher wants to take up this post

14:23.973 --> 14:25.265
But how can you run a school?

14:25.307 --> 14:27.098
'Not one teacher so far, huh?'

14:27.473 --> 14:29.182
Shocking and shameful!

14:30.103 --> 14:33.436
If there's no master to teach
or guide the students

14:33.478 --> 14:35.353
'...how will they reform, huh?'

14:35.403 --> 14:38.570
'I have personally seen
30-40 cases like this here'

14:39.088 --> 14:40.973
'Superintendent, I'm passing a Govt order'

14:41.015 --> 14:44.557
'Send it to all private, Govt schools
and colleges, to every single institution'

14:44.598 --> 14:45.848
Whole of Tamil Nadu

14:46.015 --> 14:48.432
'You'll find a master
for sure, understand?'

14:48.640 --> 14:49.973
Type out the order

14:57.848 --> 15:00.807
"They call me master
Changes will happen faster"

15:07.432 --> 15:08.515
"His entry spells power"

15:08.557 --> 15:09.890
"Who is our master?
Commander...!"

15:09.932 --> 15:12.890
'St Jeffery College is a truly renowned
educational institution in Chennai'

15:12.932 --> 15:14.890
'Alumni of this college
have carved a name'

15:14.932 --> 15:18.973
'In cinema, politics, advertising and
are celebrities in their own might'

15:19.015 --> 15:21.432
This college has molded innumerable VIPs

15:21.473 --> 15:27.223
'Students are very eager to make this
a very memorable reunion'

15:27.265 --> 15:29.557
Do you want to know why?
Come along with me

15:32.473 --> 15:33.848
Hi...Ramya

15:34.057 --> 15:35.765
- Hi, nice to meet you
- Same here

15:35.807 --> 15:37.390
I've spoken to you over the phone

15:37.432 --> 15:38.640
- Oh! That was you?
- Yeah

15:38.682 --> 15:39.926
Okay...okay

15:39.952 --> 15:42.119
- What's your full name?
- Charulatha Prasad

15:42.145 --> 15:44.687
Come, let me introduce you to everyone

15:44.723 --> 15:47.640
- This college has a decorum
- Students are capable of doing it

15:47.682 --> 15:50.765
Their plan is to ruin our image when
the minister arrives as our chief guest

15:50.807 --> 15:53.348
'If this issue leaks,
your college reputation is at stake'

15:53.390 --> 15:55.515
You want to take further action

15:55.557 --> 15:57.765
- Do so after the minister leaves
- This is well planned

15:57.807 --> 15:59.723
'Sri, stop this cat & mouse game'

15:59.765 --> 16:02.140
- You had better confess the truth
- Trust me, sir

16:02.182 --> 16:03.932
- Isn't JD responsible?
- No, sir

16:03.973 --> 16:05.307
I swear, no, sir

16:05.348 --> 16:07.598
Then who is the culprit?
Your father...?

16:07.932 --> 16:09.765
Everyone knows about Savitha's trauma

16:09.807 --> 16:12.075
I know how those 2 scumbags
sexually harassed her-

16:12.127 --> 16:13.210
Hey! Mind your words

16:13.252 --> 16:14.668
Spit that gum first

16:16.890 --> 16:17.807
I said throw it out

16:17.848 --> 16:19.723
I'll trash it as soon as
it loses its sweetness

16:19.765 --> 16:20.848
Don't act smart

16:21.504 --> 16:23.390
The two noble souls
who sexually harassed her

16:23.432 --> 16:24.973
You suspended them for 1 week

16:25.015 --> 16:27.390
Knowing it was inadequate
we even complained to the police

16:27.432 --> 16:29.848
But they took us for a ride
without taking any action

16:29.926 --> 16:32.182
Only then we knew Aadith's dad
is a rich businessman

16:32.223 --> 16:34.640
I think he has planned
to send them off to Canada

16:34.760 --> 16:36.468
That's why I took the boys

16:36.494 --> 16:38.327
'...to his house
to find out his plan'

16:40.489 --> 16:42.780
'Hello, sir, they haven't
left the house as yet'

16:42.822 --> 16:44.072
'I think they are still inside'

16:44.114 --> 16:46.780
'But it's evident they have
hatched a plot to escape'

16:46.822 --> 16:49.489
'Strangers keep walking into their house'

16:49.572 --> 16:51.905
'Sir, I can hear their voices
I think they are coming out'

16:51.947 --> 16:53.489
- 'Take care, son
- Don't worry, pa'

16:53.530 --> 16:55.947
- Be safe
- I'll call as soon as I reach

16:55.989 --> 16:57.405
'This is the duo'

16:57.489 --> 16:58.864
'Call after you reach the airport'

16:58.905 --> 17:00.155
Go...go...go

17:00.739 --> 17:01.864
Let's follow them

17:04.030 --> 17:06.072
Both of them have left home, sir

17:06.114 --> 17:08.489
Aadith and Rahul are in a taxi
They just crossed Ashok Nagar

17:08.530 --> 17:10.822
'Along with our boys
I am following them, sir'

17:10.864 --> 17:12.447
- Where are you, bro?
- 'At a signal'

17:12.488 --> 17:14.696
- Which signal?
- Jafferkhanpet

17:14.739 --> 17:15.905
Ask him the bus #

17:16.239 --> 17:17.405
- Which bus?
- '70 V'

17:17.489 --> 17:18.447
Bus #, bro?

17:18.489 --> 17:19.780
70, V

17:19.822 --> 17:21.864
It's coming close to you
Waiting at the signal now

17:21.905 --> 17:23.239
'Bro...look this side'

17:23.280 --> 17:24.822
I've spotted you
Come on, hurry up

17:24.864 --> 17:26.364
'Look, it's that bus'

17:26.405 --> 17:27.572
Quick!

17:31.989 --> 17:33.572
- 'Get in'
- Move

17:33.614 --> 17:35.447
Both of them got into bus # 70 V, sir

17:35.489 --> 17:37.905
'Bus # TN 01 AN 1184'

17:37.947 --> 17:40.155
'Bus has crossed Jafferkhanpet signa-'

17:40.864 --> 17:42.405
Why did he cut my call?

17:44.864 --> 17:47.322
"Got the man with the plan right here"

17:47.405 --> 17:49.614
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"

17:49.655 --> 17:51.780
[mobile ringing]

17:51.989 --> 17:54.280
"Yeah, clap for me, man, right here"

17:54.364 --> 17:56.822
"Got the man with the plan right here"

17:56.864 --> 17:59.114
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"

17:59.209 --> 18:01.584
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"

18:01.614 --> 18:03.864
"Yeah, clap for me, man, right here"

18:05.864 --> 18:07.905
"Hey! No matter what they say"

18:07.947 --> 18:09.447
"Master the blaster"

18:10.572 --> 18:12.697
"Hey! No matter what they do"

18:12.739 --> 18:14.197
"Mr Master the Blaster"

18:14.239 --> 18:15.280
"Riddim"

18:15.322 --> 18:17.364
"Hey! No matter what they say"

18:17.447 --> 18:18.489
"Master the blaster"

18:18.530 --> 18:19.989
"Yeah! Master the blaster"

18:20.030 --> 18:22.197
"Hey! No matter what they do"

18:22.239 --> 18:23.572
"Mr Master the Blaster"

18:23.614 --> 18:25.614
"Got the man with the plan right here"

18:25.655 --> 18:27.405
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"

18:27.447 --> 18:30.322
"Repeat!
Livin' up and sippin on beer"

18:30.405 --> 18:32.739
"Yeah, clap for me man, right here"

18:32.822 --> 18:35.197
"Got the man with the plan right here"

18:35.239 --> 18:36.989
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"

18:37.030 --> 18:39.947
"Repeat!
Livin' up and sippin on beer"

18:39.989 --> 18:42.447
"Yeah, clap for me, man, right here"

18:42.489 --> 18:43.947
"Sound the alarm"

18:44.822 --> 18:48.989
"Yeah! Give it up for my man JD
settin' fire to the screen"

18:57.919 --> 18:59.127
No problem at all, bro

18:59.169 --> 19:00.460
I've informed our boys

19:00.502 --> 19:02.085
They are inside the airport

19:02.127 --> 19:04.460
Don't worry at all
All loopholes covered

19:08.002 --> 19:09.210
"He spells power boldly"

19:09.252 --> 19:10.627
"Who is he?
Thalapathy!"

19:37.044 --> 19:38.460
Come, let's go

19:39.419 --> 19:40.419
Not you

19:40.460 --> 19:42.335
- Come
- Hey!

19:43.006 --> 19:44.215
Throw him out

19:50.585 --> 19:51.585
Who is that?

19:51.981 --> 19:53.147
Professor

19:57.085 --> 19:59.210
'Bro, get up
Come...come'

19:59.335 --> 20:00.669
Hurry up

20:03.252 --> 20:05.085
'Hey driver, don't stop the bus'

20:05.127 --> 20:06.502
Go...go...keep going

20:06.585 --> 20:07.960
'Don't stop, keep moving'

20:10.877 --> 20:11.960
[amused snigger]

20:24.502 --> 20:25.669
'Stop...stop'

20:25.710 --> 20:26.835
'Stop, man'

20:26.877 --> 20:28.835
'Let's get off
Come soon'

20:39.169 --> 20:41.210
'They got down from the bus and ran'

20:41.252 --> 20:42.502
Thank god he came in his bike

20:42.544 --> 20:44.169
- It wasn't him
- Sorry, sir, he came

20:44.710 --> 20:45.752
Sir, come

20:46.127 --> 20:48.794
'In all this confusion
they ran into the Metro station'

20:49.460 --> 20:50.835
Give me the token

20:51.669 --> 20:53.127
Come fast

20:53.794 --> 20:55.002
'Get in, quick'

21:30.669 --> 21:31.752
Looks cool, eh?

21:31.794 --> 21:35.127
I never got a chance to take a Metro train
from when it started operating

21:36.294 --> 21:37.419
Thanks, boys

21:39.119 --> 21:40.119
Hey...!

21:40.544 --> 21:42.544
I plan to stab a master here

21:43.377 --> 21:45.002
Brave hearts, continue the ride

21:45.044 --> 21:46.544
Fainthearted, alight

21:46.960 --> 21:48.127
Girls...girls

21:48.210 --> 21:49.335
I'll collect it later

21:49.377 --> 21:51.335
'If you move a bit,
I can go there and watch'

21:51.377 --> 21:52.419
Thanks, sir

21:54.585 --> 21:56.002
[smug chuckle]

22:48.978 --> 22:49.853
What?

23:01.536 --> 23:05.869
How are college students and
'dhoti' clad politicians connected?

23:13.252 --> 23:15.127
Airport is close by

23:15.169 --> 23:16.833
Catch an auto or something and go

23:16.880 --> 23:18.796
Don't wait here
Hurry up

23:23.252 --> 23:25.502
They rushed out and
got into a share auto

23:25.544 --> 23:28.210
Turned out to be our friend
Jameel anna's auto, I got in too!

23:28.252 --> 23:30.794
'Easy-peasy that's where they got caught'

23:37.127 --> 23:39.210
- Escape to Canada, right?
- Yes, sir

23:39.252 --> 23:42.002
'Friends encircled and took them
to the police station, right?'

23:42.044 --> 23:43.169
Yes, sir

23:43.627 --> 23:45.585
So you were responsible
for everything

23:45.627 --> 23:48.294
- Yes, sir
- JD had nothing to do with this?

23:48.335 --> 23:49.960
We swear, nothing at all, sir

23:50.002 --> 23:51.044
'Sir'

23:51.085 --> 23:53.710
Those 2 boys swear
your teacher JD was behind this

23:53.752 --> 23:55.919
- These students are lying
- Of course I know, sir

23:55.960 --> 23:57.210
JD is the culprit

23:57.252 --> 23:59.294
- Who is JD?
- 'He is playing up with their support'

23:59.335 --> 24:01.585
- I'll tell you, long story
- 'One day he'll get caught'

24:01.627 --> 24:02.794
'That will be his doomsday'

24:02.835 --> 24:04.169
Minister has arrived

24:04.210 --> 24:06.294
If you are ready, we can
escort him to the auditorium

24:06.335 --> 24:07.460
Come...come

24:07.502 --> 24:08.877
Sir, you please sit

24:09.085 --> 24:11.335
- I'll be back in 10 minutes
- I'll wait

24:11.377 --> 24:12.877
- Serve him tea
- Carry on

24:12.919 --> 24:14.210
2 minutes, sir
I'll be right back

24:14.252 --> 24:15.585
Not picking your call, huh?

24:15.627 --> 24:17.210
It's ringing but he isn't picking

24:17.252 --> 24:19.919
Same-same when student
and now as master also?

24:19.960 --> 24:22.252
Shut up, da
Vanathi, didn't you try?

24:22.377 --> 24:23.585
I asked the students

24:23.627 --> 24:25.460
- What did they say?
- He has been suspended

24:25.502 --> 24:28.419
If you had told us earlier, we could
have gone in person and brought him

24:28.460 --> 24:30.335
He must be very busy, try again

24:30.377 --> 24:32.752
'We relish the 'rajma' happil-'

24:32.794 --> 24:35.085
[mobile ringing]

24:35.127 --> 24:37.419
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"

24:37.460 --> 24:39.919
"Yeah, clap for me, man, right here"

24:39.960 --> 24:41.960
Uncle, he's our Principal
Anbiah Samuel

24:42.002 --> 24:43.752
Welcome, sir
This is our vice principal

24:46.794 --> 24:47.919
'Ramya?'

24:47.960 --> 24:50.544
If that student is such a troublemaker

24:50.585 --> 24:52.669
...why not just dismiss him?

24:52.710 --> 24:55.669
Then he should have
got dismissed 20 years ago!

24:55.924 --> 24:57.049
I don't get it

24:57.835 --> 24:59.044
JD isn't a student, my dear

24:59.085 --> 25:00.085
Professor!

25:00.127 --> 25:02.710
- Whaaat?
- Dean of student affairs

25:03.377 --> 25:05.044
'First of all
we welcome you all'

25:05.085 --> 25:07.085
'Good morning one and all present here'

25:07.127 --> 25:10.085
'Our honorable chief guest
Manavai R Gauthaman'

25:10.127 --> 25:12.627
'Respected dignitaries on the dais'

25:12.669 --> 25:13.710
'What happened?'

25:26.835 --> 25:29.960
Sir, students are refusing
to come from the back stage

25:31.085 --> 25:33.210
It seems you said this function
won't go on without JD?

25:33.252 --> 25:35.627
Then what, sir? We kept
telling you he is not to blame

25:35.669 --> 25:37.169
'You've suspended him for 2 weeks'

25:37.210 --> 25:39.710
Any other day it's fine, sir
This alumni meet is only for him

25:39.752 --> 25:42.335
How can he not be here, sir?
Nothing will happen without him

25:42.377 --> 25:44.252
Are you the human rights activist?

25:45.835 --> 25:47.085
Just you wait!

25:47.127 --> 25:49.585
Sir, the minister has been
waiting for a long time

25:49.627 --> 25:51.919
- Please bear with us
- He cancelled so many appointments

25:51.960 --> 25:54.710
- Start the program
- I'll talk to them and join you

25:57.710 --> 26:00.794
Om Shanti! Om Shanti!
Peace in speech and spirit

26:00.835 --> 26:03.085
- Call JD
- You suspended him and asking me to call?

26:03.127 --> 26:05.335
- You call him
- I don't know his #

26:05.377 --> 26:06.377
Call him, dude

26:06.419 --> 26:08.085
Call before he changes his mind

26:09.419 --> 26:11.710
[humming a song]

26:12.252 --> 26:14.169
[mobile ringing]

26:14.544 --> 26:17.169
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"

26:17.577 --> 26:19.661
Hello...huh...JD

26:20.210 --> 26:22.627
This is Principal...Samuel here

26:22.669 --> 26:24.127
JD sir is fast asleep

26:24.169 --> 26:25.127
Call later

26:25.169 --> 26:26.585
Principal Anbiah Samuel

26:26.627 --> 26:29.627
Anbu, your name can mean love but
he won't get up to hear your loving words

26:29.669 --> 26:32.419
- Guzzled down 3 or 4 bottles
- 'Can you wake him up or not?'

26:33.044 --> 26:34.210
No chance, love

26:37.627 --> 26:38.544
Hey!

26:38.920 --> 26:40.004
He's drunk

26:41.127 --> 26:42.127
What can I do?

26:42.169 --> 26:44.794
Will you ask your Education Minister
to wait for half an hour?

26:44.835 --> 26:46.085
We'll go and get him

26:47.044 --> 26:48.127
- Whaat?
- Do it

26:52.624 --> 26:54.541
- What, da?
- Not budging an inch

26:59.585 --> 27:01.044
Is this how you drum-roll?

27:01.085 --> 27:03.002
Getting paid right?
Bump it, fellows

27:07.335 --> 27:08.960
Rock & roll, man

27:09.044 --> 27:10.835
This is it
This is what we want

27:10.919 --> 27:12.585
Ready, da
Come on, da

27:12.669 --> 27:14.585
"Master is coming, move aside"

27:19.627 --> 27:21.127
Hey stop...stop

27:22.252 --> 27:23.710
Lift him

27:24.627 --> 27:26.794
Heave-ho!

27:44.085 --> 27:45.127
Speed up!

27:52.002 --> 27:53.960
- Sir, good morning
- Good morning

27:54.002 --> 27:55.127
Tea, sir

28:06.252 --> 28:09.085
"The moment our bro steps in
it's like an atom bomb exploding"

28:16.127 --> 28:18.960
- Did they really invite me?
- Sir, why this doubt?

28:19.002 --> 28:20.627
'I swear they asked you to come'

28:21.835 --> 28:23.460
Bro, beat the drum

28:34.678 --> 28:35.970
"Master coming!"

28:36.004 --> 28:37.004
'Move aside!'

28:41.377 --> 28:42.752
'Rock & roll!'

28:48.127 --> 28:50.960
"Deliberately if you make trouble"

28:51.044 --> 28:53.877
"It will boomerang on you centuple"

28:53.960 --> 28:56.669
"If you jeer or sneer at us"

28:56.721 --> 28:59.471
"Mind you, you'll be limbless"

29:01.827 --> 29:02.869
'Zazzorific!'

29:04.627 --> 29:05.835
Aiyo!

29:09.710 --> 29:11.377
"Tell topsy turvy
Yell curvy scurvy"

29:21.419 --> 29:23.044
"Rock & roll
Heart & soul"

29:32.252 --> 29:34.835
"Split their ears, no matter
Scare them to scatter"

29:45.752 --> 29:46.794
'Move aside'

30:01.788 --> 30:02.913
Aiyo!

30:30.127 --> 30:33.252
"The second our bro steps in
it's like an atom bomb exploding"

30:47.002 --> 30:49.585
"Hit the drum harder
Scare them to scatter"

30:59.127 --> 31:01.044
"Master, coming"

31:02.127 --> 31:03.794
Bent double, sir?

31:03.960 --> 31:05.585
- Where is the ID card?
- I have it, sir

31:05.627 --> 31:07.252
- First wear it and go inside
- Done

31:15.252 --> 31:17.877
'We are all soaked in celebration mode'

31:20.252 --> 31:21.252
Let's go

31:25.210 --> 31:27.835
- 'Sit with us, da'
- Is he a professor?

31:28.044 --> 31:29.210
Suspended professor

31:29.252 --> 31:30.544
'What is his name?'

31:30.585 --> 31:31.627
'JD'

31:33.210 --> 31:34.169
Start the program

31:34.210 --> 31:35.794
Sir, 1 minute
Let me speak

31:35.835 --> 31:36.835
Sir-

31:37.169 --> 31:38.544
Give this to JD sir

31:39.919 --> 31:41.377
'I've attended
many college functions'

31:41.419 --> 31:43.669
- Wear your ID card
- 'Witnessed many gatherings'

31:43.710 --> 31:46.044
'But I've never seen a crowd like this'

31:46.377 --> 31:48.377
Because the entire crowd here

31:48.669 --> 31:50.669
More than the anchor of the show

31:50.710 --> 31:52.627
'They are celebrating
the man seated below'

31:52.669 --> 31:54.127
'It is no mean achievement'

31:54.169 --> 31:56.752
'If he is getting this kind of
reception among students'

31:56.794 --> 32:00.210
'Then he must be a dedicated
and focused professor'

32:00.252 --> 32:01.544
'If he himself is like this...'

32:01.585 --> 32:03.710
- 'Imagine his students'
- Why try all these gimmicks?

32:03.752 --> 32:05.127
'Must be good as gold'

32:05.794 --> 32:08.002
'First give this man
a big round of applause'

32:09.169 --> 32:11.252
To get a professor like him

32:11.544 --> 32:13.460
You and your college
must be truly blessed

32:13.502 --> 32:14.934
Your eyes are red
Wear this shade

32:14.986 --> 32:16.861
'This most revered master'

32:16.903 --> 32:19.986
'I would like him to come up
to the dais and say a few words'

32:21.252 --> 32:22.294
'I am calling you, sir'

32:22.335 --> 32:23.335
Please come

32:24.882 --> 32:26.216
Come up and speak

32:26.919 --> 32:28.835
Hey...! Where are you going?

32:28.877 --> 32:30.794
Wait, let me tell a mini story

32:30.835 --> 32:32.335
Did you look at your shoes?

32:33.044 --> 32:34.794
Instead of being humiliated, sit down

32:34.835 --> 32:36.210
If you get up once more-

32:36.252 --> 32:38.169
Please take your seat

32:40.127 --> 32:41.294
JD is our-

32:42.460 --> 32:45.585
Management and staff
are completely against JD

32:45.856 --> 32:47.731
But students celebrate him

32:48.478 --> 32:49.561
I don't get this

32:49.919 --> 32:52.377
He has gone out of his way
for students' welfare

32:52.419 --> 32:54.085
Students revere him as their true hero

32:54.127 --> 32:56.210
Reason enough for
the management to dislike him

32:56.252 --> 32:58.919
Secondly after 6:00 p.m
our hero will be totally sloshed!

33:05.877 --> 33:07.627
- 'Sorry
- Sorry, guys'

33:29.710 --> 33:30.877
Hello, sir

33:31.585 --> 33:32.835
Good morning, sir

33:40.085 --> 33:41.085
Careful, sir

33:44.877 --> 33:46.210
- Sorry...sorry
- It's okay

33:48.960 --> 33:49.960
Hi...hi

33:50.002 --> 33:51.544
Your classroom is at that end

33:51.585 --> 33:53.044
Oh! Good morning

33:53.085 --> 33:55.919
'What is his flashback sob story
to get sloshed every day?'

33:55.960 --> 33:57.085
Don't ask him that alone

33:57.127 --> 34:00.210
If he gets a gullible idiot, he'll reel off
a Mani Ratnam classic as his own!

34:00.252 --> 34:02.960
Fell head over heels, chased her
in the college, bus, everywhere

34:03.002 --> 34:07.169
She also reciprocated and one day
we were happily sitting in a coffee shop

34:07.210 --> 34:08.294
Her father walked in!

34:08.335 --> 34:10.710
- Aiyo! Did you get caught?
- Wait, akka

34:10.752 --> 34:11.960
Her father's name

34:12.002 --> 34:13.210
Mr Chandramouli!

34:13.252 --> 34:15.169
We were both neighbors
in Rainbow Colony

34:15.210 --> 34:17.085
I was in 8G
She was in 7G

34:17.127 --> 34:18.252
India is here

34:18.960 --> 34:20.669
America is right here

34:20.877 --> 34:24.585
I took my guitar and left, my love for
Anjalai was as strong as 1000 elephants!

34:24.627 --> 34:26.752
We climbed up straight to
the top of the mountain

34:26.794 --> 34:29.169
We decided to jump
counting 1 to 5

34:29.210 --> 34:31.669
My bad luck, I got stuck
in a tree and escaped death

34:32.002 --> 34:33.044
What, da?

34:33.210 --> 34:35.169
Her head hit a boulder and she died

34:35.210 --> 34:37.419
- That's a Kamal classic...don't bug me
- Hey...listen

34:37.460 --> 34:38.919
Too much filmy imagination

34:39.710 --> 34:41.419
Okay, which department is he in?

34:41.460 --> 34:44.210
He studied in this same college
He finished M.Phil Psychology here

34:44.252 --> 34:46.752
'Now he teaches
Personality Development'

34:46.794 --> 34:49.002
May I request you all to please stand up?

34:49.981 --> 34:52.689
I said...stand...up

34:52.746 --> 34:56.037
Now I intend checking
if your mind and body are focused

34:56.127 --> 34:57.335
We are hearing

34:58.746 --> 34:59.871
But not listening

34:59.897 --> 35:03.200
Students don't listen to their teachers
Teachers don't listen to their students

35:03.252 --> 35:04.294
Now

35:04.335 --> 35:05.585
RUN

35:06.002 --> 35:07.710
Run...run...run

35:07.752 --> 35:08.794
WATER!

35:10.012 --> 35:11.178
Electricity...!

35:13.127 --> 35:17.085
Children don't listen to their parents
Parents don't listen to their children

35:17.127 --> 35:18.252
And finally

35:18.419 --> 35:20.536
No one listens to the people!

35:20.587 --> 35:23.462
Whatever I tell you now
repeat it verbatim

35:23.512 --> 35:24.512
But

35:24.939 --> 35:26.189
Do just the opposite

35:26.335 --> 35:27.919
Jump in

35:27.960 --> 35:29.585
Jump left

35:29.627 --> 35:31.585
Jump right
Dai...dai...!

35:31.627 --> 35:33.002
Now on the starboard

35:33.720 --> 35:35.012
Faster...faster...faster

35:35.054 --> 35:37.471
Now close your eyes and freeze

35:43.294 --> 35:44.794
Class disperse

35:46.463 --> 35:47.713
Getting late for my class

35:47.754 --> 35:49.545
- We'll meet at lunch
- Okay, sure

35:54.794 --> 35:56.169
'Let me repeat this'

35:56.210 --> 35:58.627
That scoundrel Bhavani is
responsible for all this

35:58.669 --> 36:02.002
He finished off his opponents contesting
in our Union election one by one

36:02.044 --> 36:03.960
I know his history A to Z

36:04.002 --> 36:07.210
Gurumurthy, whether these people
understand it or not, hope you do

36:08.044 --> 36:10.044
I have been saying this
right from the beginning

36:10.085 --> 36:11.085
Who endorsed my view?

36:11.127 --> 36:13.752
With the help of juveniles
he is into all criminal activities

36:13.794 --> 36:15.002
Has the cat got your tongue?!

36:15.044 --> 36:17.627
- Tell them
- Yov! We know this alread-

36:29.252 --> 36:30.419
Vanakkam, anna

36:31.585 --> 36:32.877
Damn you!

36:32.999 --> 36:35.124
Are you such a big shot, huh?

36:35.658 --> 36:38.366
If you kill him, will you get his post?

36:38.564 --> 36:40.356
- Let me see
- No, bro

36:40.413 --> 36:42.663
Why are you so mad at me?
I'm like a brother to you

36:42.720 --> 36:44.053
Whatever it is
let's talk it over

36:44.087 --> 36:45.920
Any need for me to talk to you?

36:45.970 --> 36:47.053
I'll close your chapter!

36:47.103 --> 36:48.145
Get the car ready

36:48.193 --> 36:50.193
Bro, will a problem
be solved if we fight?

36:50.252 --> 36:52.544
Will murder solve the problem?
Let's discuss it amicably

36:52.585 --> 36:56.210
I'll use the same juvenile delinquents
you use as tool to finish you off!

36:56.252 --> 36:57.210
Want to wait and watch?

36:57.252 --> 36:59.085
I'm like one of them
You watched me grow

36:59.127 --> 37:01.044
- Wait, bro
- You peed in your pants scared of me

37:01.085 --> 37:02.585
You think you're my equal now?

37:02.627 --> 37:04.294
Whatever it is, let's talk it over

37:04.335 --> 37:06.710
I am much younger than you
But pay heed to my words

37:06.752 --> 37:07.877
Don't go, br-

37:08.502 --> 37:09.627
'Oh my God!'

37:09.752 --> 37:11.085
Gone, anna?

37:11.169 --> 37:12.919
'Catch that lorry driver'

37:18.960 --> 37:20.085
So sad!

37:20.127 --> 37:21.210
You were eye witnesses

37:21.252 --> 37:22.752
What did I do?

37:22.794 --> 37:25.210
If I had walked out talking to him
I would've shared his fate

37:25.252 --> 37:27.210
Impossible for a human
to time this so perfectly

37:27.252 --> 37:29.044
I pray to all Gods thrice daily

37:29.085 --> 37:31.252
So God has saved me
and punished him

37:31.460 --> 37:32.877
'He was a good soul!'

37:35.502 --> 37:38.085
To conduct Students' election
in our college this year

37:38.127 --> 37:42.960
University Grants Commission has granted
permission, but I opposed it strictly

37:43.044 --> 37:47.377
That's why for a mere formality
I need all your opinions

37:47.919 --> 37:49.835
Why we don't want election

37:49.877 --> 37:51.127
For the records

37:51.710 --> 37:53.585
I somehow feel it is unnecessary, sir

37:53.627 --> 37:54.919
'Semester is fast approaching'

37:54.960 --> 37:57.044
'In the current scenario
why do we need an election?'

37:57.085 --> 37:59.333
'Sir, if this is happening
some other issues will create'

37:59.373 --> 38:01.832
- I don't think they are fit for elections
- Exactly

38:01.960 --> 38:03.752
'In my honest opinion, no'

38:03.794 --> 38:06.210
'I have no issues with
the day college students'

38:06.252 --> 38:08.419
'I am a little apprehensive
about the evening batch'

38:08.460 --> 38:09.710
Thanks, Ramya

38:09.752 --> 38:10.835
Charulatha, your opinion?

38:10.877 --> 38:14.002
It's only been 2 weeks
since I joined, sir

38:14.127 --> 38:16.752
So if I voice my opinion
I don't know if it will be right

38:16.794 --> 38:18.377
Come on, what's there?

38:19.419 --> 38:20.710
- No, sir
- Hey!

38:20.752 --> 38:23.044
- Why is JD sir keeping quiet?
- That's right?

38:23.127 --> 38:25.960
- He'll wait to get a good point
- 'I don't think election is a good idea'

38:26.002 --> 38:29.460
Sir, to be on the safe side
ask JD his opinion

38:32.377 --> 38:34.627
'JD, tell us your opinion'

38:39.794 --> 38:41.877
What is your opinion, JD?

38:41.919 --> 38:44.085
- What day was yesterday?
- Thursday

38:44.127 --> 38:45.752
Thursday is his day off, da

38:45.794 --> 38:47.794
- 'Professor JD'
- He would have been piss drunk

38:47.835 --> 38:50.252
- Come...come
- Hey! Careful

38:51.002 --> 38:52.127
'JD...?'

38:53.835 --> 38:55.210
SIR!

38:55.252 --> 38:56.377
Emergency, sir

38:56.419 --> 38:57.460
What are you doing here?

38:57.502 --> 38:59.377
Let me give this phone to Rosie madam

38:59.419 --> 39:01.210
Her husband fell off his bike

39:01.252 --> 39:02.502
'What the hell are you doing?'

39:02.544 --> 39:03.585
I will expel you

39:03.627 --> 39:06.210
- Let her just talk to him
- What happened, Abdul?

39:06.419 --> 39:07.419
'Wake up, sir'

39:07.460 --> 39:08.919
Don't switch off your phone

39:08.960 --> 39:10.044
Talk to him

39:10.169 --> 39:11.669
- Poor husband
- 1 minute, sir

39:11.710 --> 39:14.044
They are objecting to elections
Support us, sir

39:14.585 --> 39:15.669
- Sorry, sir
- Get out

39:15.710 --> 39:17.252
- Useless fellow!
- Thank you, sir

39:18.710 --> 39:21.127
JD, what is your opinion
about conducting elections?

39:21.169 --> 39:23.669
Election is essential, that's all

39:24.294 --> 39:27.085
- I thought as much
- 'He will say something meaningless, sir'

39:27.127 --> 39:30.960
If we announce a students' election
all of them will be thinking of only that

39:31.002 --> 39:33.752
Not one of them will study
nor will anyone attend any class

39:33.794 --> 39:37.210
Correct, what will they learn
by conducting students' election?

39:37.710 --> 39:39.502
Why encourage politics in college?

39:40.044 --> 39:41.294
Matthew sir

39:41.752 --> 39:43.377
What is 'politics', sir?

39:43.710 --> 39:45.377
Sir, I don't wish to talk to you

39:45.877 --> 39:47.460
Is that so?
But I wish to speak

39:47.502 --> 39:48.502
I'm coming

39:51.502 --> 39:52.544
Sir

39:53.335 --> 39:56.085
First a student should know
'politics' means service

39:56.127 --> 39:59.752
Only if our students learn about election,
canvassing, leadership in college

39:59.794 --> 40:02.877
...they will have an awareness about
state, central elections for the future

40:02.919 --> 40:05.710
College students are our first time voters

40:06.127 --> 40:07.502
Only if (s)he is allowed to think

40:07.544 --> 40:09.710
A new leader will emerge
for the next generation

40:09.752 --> 40:12.502
To mould as a good leader
or to choose the right leader

40:12.544 --> 40:14.669
...they will acquire
both tact and discretion

40:14.710 --> 40:16.002
For someone to-

40:16.319 --> 40:18.944
They will stick posters all over
and spoil the walls with graffiti

40:18.970 --> 40:20.887
Then claim ownership
over the walls and fight

40:20.913 --> 40:23.038
Doesn't all this happen
in normal elections?

40:23.118 --> 40:24.118
Sit down, sir

40:25.044 --> 40:27.877
Aren't these normal issues
that crop up in general elections?

40:27.919 --> 40:30.335
So can we decide to
abolish elections in our country?

40:30.377 --> 40:33.752
'We have grown up with this culture of
poster, banner, fanfare, still follow it'

40:33.794 --> 40:37.169
If students should know
the do's and don'ts of poster etc

40:37.210 --> 40:39.252
...we must conduct
elections in college

40:39.419 --> 40:41.085
Only then he will be
a good example outside

40:41.127 --> 40:45.252
'If our culture of bribing with 'biriyani'
booze and big bucks should change'

40:45.377 --> 40:47.752
...students should know
the ins and outs of politics

40:47.835 --> 40:48.835
Okay

40:49.210 --> 40:50.919
Let's assume what you're saying is right

40:50.960 --> 40:55.877
Who is responsible if students resort
to violence or damage college property?

40:55.919 --> 40:58.002
Sir, nothing of that sort will happen

40:58.044 --> 41:00.752
If you are proved wrong
will you leave this college?

41:00.835 --> 41:02.877
Will you resign, huh?

41:03.377 --> 41:04.710
We'll see if it happens

41:04.919 --> 41:07.127
Then you be the presiding officer

41:07.210 --> 41:08.877
And conduct this election

41:09.210 --> 41:11.085
If any problem crops up

41:11.127 --> 41:13.585
Sign an affidavit
you will leave this college

41:19.544 --> 41:22.585
Coming June 25th
Students' elections

41:22.669 --> 41:24.419
[loud cheering]

41:26.335 --> 41:29.127
I haven't seen him conduct
an election as a master

41:29.169 --> 41:31.919
'But I've seen him
do the same as a student'

41:36.502 --> 41:37.544
Pccht!

41:41.169 --> 41:42.460
Shake your hands

41:48.169 --> 41:50.127
This is the wall of democracy

41:50.169 --> 41:51.835
Your rules & regulations

41:56.085 --> 41:58.044
'Gym facilities free for all students'

41:58.127 --> 42:00.627
'Meat will be served for all in the hostel'

42:00.752 --> 42:04.377
Good orators have become able leaders
You should speak up more boldly, Savi

42:04.419 --> 42:06.919
'Instead of finding faults
with your rival and campaigning'

42:06.960 --> 42:09.085
'...ask for votes
listing your reforms'

42:09.835 --> 42:12.335
Tear every single poster, dude

42:12.377 --> 42:15.335
Posters and banners should be stuck
or erected in their allocated places

42:15.377 --> 42:17.544
'Even if there's a small brawl
among the students'

42:17.585 --> 42:19.002
'...election will be canceled'

42:20.252 --> 42:22.960
You pull back and fire

42:23.002 --> 42:24.002
Cheers!

42:24.044 --> 42:26.210
'Our total strength is 5500 students, sir'

42:26.252 --> 42:28.544
We have divided them into 10 categories

42:28.919 --> 42:29.960
What is this column?

42:30.002 --> 42:32.544
That is religion & caste category

42:32.960 --> 42:34.335
Let's avoid that

42:34.377 --> 42:36.794
Only if we delete it here

42:36.835 --> 42:39.002
It won't tag along with us terribly

42:41.502 --> 42:44.585
Hey! How much longer do you intend
drinking like this and roaming around?

42:44.669 --> 42:46.377
Why yell at me
for no reason?

42:46.419 --> 42:48.752
Will I yell at you
if you are steady on your feet?

42:50.585 --> 42:52.710
- I am sober
- Is that so?

42:54.210 --> 42:56.044
Hit an arrow
anywhere on this board

42:56.085 --> 42:57.919
I'll agree you are
sober and steady

42:58.169 --> 43:00.169
Machi, aim for the bull's eye

43:10.627 --> 43:12.460
Rs 1 lakh to students
in each department

43:12.502 --> 43:14.044
Cheers!

43:14.794 --> 43:17.335
'I have a fair amount of
experience in counselling'

43:17.377 --> 43:21.210
If you can tell me the reason
I can do my level best to help you

43:21.252 --> 43:24.085
Earlier on...when I was jobless

43:25.377 --> 43:27.877
I was hanging around
in a tiles company in Rajasthan

43:27.919 --> 43:29.252
- Oh!
- At that time

43:29.287 --> 43:31.996
A girl lost her bag in the train

43:32.419 --> 43:34.919
I found it and sent it to her

43:35.044 --> 43:37.252
She liked me for the effort I took

43:38.085 --> 43:41.960
She and I became pen pals and
we built a 'Fort of love' just for us

43:43.085 --> 43:45.627
Then when she knew
I was in Rajasthan

43:45.669 --> 43:47.419
For my sake that girl
took extra pains

43:47.460 --> 43:51.335
Embroidered, knitted
a sweater and sent it to me

43:51.377 --> 43:52.960
Sweater in Rajasthan!

43:55.252 --> 43:56.419
True that?

44:05.585 --> 44:07.585
'Whenever you have a problem
and you come to me'

44:07.627 --> 44:09.669
'Even if it's midnight
I'll be there for you'

44:09.710 --> 44:12.710
Why should we create problems
and end up in the police station?

44:12.752 --> 44:14.252
Beverages free in the canteen

44:14.710 --> 44:16.377
Aqua training access free

44:16.419 --> 44:19.710
You will have campus interviews
You'll leave the college with a job in hand

44:19.752 --> 44:21.710
Above all give this serious thought

44:21.752 --> 44:23.794
Do you want to be ruled by a girl?

44:23.835 --> 44:25.460
Or revel in a boy's leadership?

44:29.210 --> 44:32.294
Hey! That isn't even my glass

44:32.335 --> 44:35.002
Some other chap has relished
a drink and gone, madcap!

44:35.044 --> 44:36.169
How dare you!

44:36.877 --> 44:38.544
1 'JD' please

44:56.919 --> 44:59.335
'3rd round of votes
have been counted'

44:59.585 --> 45:02.252
'We have started counting
for the 4th round'

45:05.377 --> 45:06.252
Sir...?

45:06.294 --> 45:07.502
'4th round, sir'

45:07.627 --> 45:09.419
Results are due any moment

45:10.127 --> 45:11.627
I'm scared, sir

45:16.085 --> 45:18.335
Are you Satyaraj acting
as Amavasai in 'Amaidhi Padai'?

45:18.377 --> 45:19.502
4th round it seems

45:19.544 --> 45:20.585
Pah!

45:20.752 --> 45:24.752
'Most awaiting election results
are going to be declared very soon'

45:28.627 --> 45:31.752
'Fourth and final election results
are going to be declared'

45:32.585 --> 45:35.294
Bhargav 2588 votes

45:35.377 --> 45:37.877
'Savitha 2648 votes'

45:37.960 --> 45:40.377
'Savitha won the election by 60 votes'

45:43.127 --> 45:44.585
[loud cheering]

45:57.419 --> 45:59.252
Congratulations, chairperson

45:59.460 --> 46:02.627
Sir, I think they have already
started creating a ruckus there

46:02.669 --> 46:04.085
Sir, what do we do now?

46:04.127 --> 46:06.877
Why do you still ask me?
She's the captain of your ship

46:06.919 --> 46:09.085
Chairman, tell us what to do?

46:10.585 --> 46:11.544
'Sir'

46:11.585 --> 46:16.002
To avoid all these unnecessary confusion
I'm thinking of talking to Bhargav directly

46:16.419 --> 46:17.460
Look at that!

46:17.710 --> 46:19.044
By all means go and talk

46:19.169 --> 46:20.419
But go alone

46:21.585 --> 46:22.669
Madam

46:22.794 --> 46:26.002
Don't dilly-dally, scratch your head,
crack your knuckles and keep looking back

46:26.044 --> 46:27.752
Don't dawdle and
do 'instalment' walk

46:27.794 --> 46:29.044
Forward march!

46:31.710 --> 46:34.669
Sir, will you give me your bracelet?

46:35.002 --> 46:35.919
Why?

46:35.960 --> 46:37.002
Please give, sir

46:37.044 --> 46:38.127
'Dude, play that song'

46:38.788 --> 46:43.497
"Look! We must lead a life like that bird
Without a care in the world"

46:43.529 --> 46:47.988
"We should go on a dancing spree
like the waves here in glee"

46:48.038 --> 46:52.455
"Under the same sky spacious
On the same land so precious"

46:52.504 --> 46:57.087
"Under the same sky endless
On our Motherland peerless"

46:57.252 --> 47:01.002
"Let's sing in unity our song
of what is our right all along"

47:01.044 --> 47:02.502
I want to talk to you

47:02.585 --> 47:05.877
If she comes offering a truce
I'll break the bones on her face

47:05.960 --> 47:08.252
[song from 'Aayirathil Oruvan']

47:09.585 --> 47:11.335
- Bro, tell me
- 'What happened?'

47:11.377 --> 47:12.752
Your son lost, bro

47:13.044 --> 47:13.919
What?

47:13.960 --> 47:15.669
Bhargav...er-

47:16.085 --> 47:17.794
I came to congratulate

47:18.044 --> 47:21.919
Winning by just 60 votes
is no big victory at all

47:22.544 --> 47:26.002
Er...is there any rule in college
there should be only 1 chairman?

47:26.085 --> 47:28.919
You take over day college
and I'll handle evening college

47:29.960 --> 47:31.377
Okay, bye

47:32.583 --> 47:33.585
Congrats

47:34.210 --> 47:36.210
I extended my hand
even on nomination day

47:36.252 --> 47:37.835
You didn't want to shake hands

47:40.710 --> 47:42.377
At least let it be truce now?

47:43.669 --> 47:45.919
I don't think it's safe
for her to go alone

47:45.960 --> 47:47.669
Shall I go and check, sir?

47:56.585 --> 47:57.835
'Let's shake hands'

47:59.002 --> 48:00.544
- Okay
- How ridiculous

48:00.585 --> 48:02.127
He has patched up happily

48:02.327 --> 48:04.077
'He is shaking hands
with that girl who won'

48:04.127 --> 48:05.127
'Let me talk to him'

48:05.169 --> 48:06.169
1 minute, bro

48:06.210 --> 48:07.210
'Bhargav brother'

48:08.377 --> 48:11.252
Dad, there's no problem
I spoke to that girl

48:11.294 --> 48:13.460
She even asked me to be
the chairman for Day college, pa

48:13.544 --> 48:16.627
'You got a sudden desire to
beg a post from her, huh?'

48:16.752 --> 48:19.710
It isn't what you think, pa
I'll come in person and explain

48:22.377 --> 48:24.669
- Bro
- 'Pack him home in our car now'

48:24.710 --> 48:25.752
Okay, bro

48:25.794 --> 48:27.530
'If he refuses to go, threaten him'

48:27.572 --> 48:30.364
- 'Rough up that female who defeated him'
- I'll handle it

48:31.419 --> 48:33.669
I'll explain to my dad
Please don't create a ruckus

48:33.710 --> 48:36.669
He has given me permission
to scar even your face, bro

48:36.710 --> 48:37.960
First get inside

48:38.252 --> 48:39.710
But please don't hurt that girl

48:39.752 --> 48:41.585
Sir, he wasn't nasty to me

48:41.627 --> 48:43.335
I shook hands and he said okay

48:43.919 --> 48:45.002
That's all

48:45.044 --> 48:46.460
Celebrations are done

48:46.835 --> 48:48.627
Hey! Catch

48:48.669 --> 48:49.710
Wear these IDS

48:49.752 --> 48:51.752
- Where's the booth?
- 1st floor, bro

48:51.835 --> 48:52.919
'Hurry up'

48:54.960 --> 48:56.752
Clear up all this mess
and then celebrate

48:56.794 --> 49:01.044
Sir, evening college students are
planning to burn down the booth

49:10.669 --> 49:12.377
- Who is he?
- Professor, bro

49:12.419 --> 49:14.169
- What, da?
- That wasn't a proper election

49:14.210 --> 49:17.002
- We demand re-election or re-counting
- Election is over, that's all

49:17.085 --> 49:19.044
- Burn down the booth
- Which department are you?

49:19.085 --> 49:20.835
- Come here
- Stop this idle talk

49:20.877 --> 49:23.002
I'll kill you
I'll break all your teeth!

49:23.044 --> 49:24.502
- Sri, quiet!
- 'Give that bottle'

49:24.544 --> 49:25.710
- Wait
- Sir...!

49:27.710 --> 49:29.919
- Sir, let go
- 'Shut up, all of you'

49:30.669 --> 49:31.835
I'm trying to make peace-

49:31.877 --> 49:33.544
Siiiiir
Move aside

49:33.585 --> 49:36.419
Evening college chairman candidate
Bhargav wants to talk to you, sir

49:36.460 --> 49:38.085
'My dad didn't listen to me'

49:38.127 --> 49:41.002
He has sent 50-60 Party riff-raffs
to bash up everyone in college

49:41.044 --> 49:44.460
'They have merged with the students
Ensure our college students are safe, sir'

49:49.252 --> 49:50.919
On the starboard!

49:50.960 --> 49:53.377
- 'Why are all of them spinning?
- What are they doing?'

49:53.419 --> 49:55.502
Now close your eyes and freeze

49:55.585 --> 49:57.585
'What is this?
Tell us, bro'

49:57.627 --> 49:59.169
'Sticking to the wall like glue?'

49:59.210 --> 50:00.210
Move forward

50:00.252 --> 50:01.794
'They are doing just the opposite'

50:01.835 --> 50:03.044
'Wait, don't go'

50:07.669 --> 50:10.085
Send all the girls home safe

50:10.248 --> 50:12.123
- Sir?
- Just do as I say

50:12.627 --> 50:14.544
Hey! Take all of them
through the back door

50:14.585 --> 50:16.085
Go...go...fast

50:16.127 --> 50:17.127
'Go now'

50:40.460 --> 50:41.794
SAVITHA, YOU GO!

50:42.710 --> 50:44.419
Hey! That's the girl

50:44.460 --> 50:45.502
'Grab her'

50:51.127 --> 50:52.127
Savitha

50:55.085 --> 50:56.419
Hey...hey!

51:01.794 --> 51:02.835
Hey!

51:06.223 --> 51:07.514
Are you okay?

51:12.960 --> 51:14.377
Go in...quick

51:18.210 --> 51:20.710
Sir, students are all out of control

51:26.210 --> 51:27.419
Let me go

51:27.460 --> 51:29.377
- Take your hands off
- Sir...sir

51:29.419 --> 51:30.794
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF!

51:34.335 --> 51:37.044
How dare you manhandle girls!

51:57.460 --> 51:58.585
Master...!

52:20.794 --> 52:23.085
Nothing major, just a nail scratch

52:23.127 --> 52:26.085
Dai! Meeting is being held in the library

52:26.127 --> 52:27.460
Is everyone safe, da?

52:27.502 --> 52:28.752
'I have checked all the groups'

52:28.794 --> 52:29.794
They have texted me

52:29.835 --> 52:33.044
The entire riot has been recorded
in our college CCTV cameras

52:33.085 --> 52:34.585
Is he behaving like a professor?

52:34.627 --> 52:37.169
Excuse me, ma'am, you are
talking about damage of property

52:37.210 --> 52:39.794
Rowdies got together and
bashed up 4-5 of our girls

52:39.877 --> 52:41.835
What could all the teachers do?

52:41.877 --> 52:44.044
- No one came to stop them
- Stop it, Charu

52:44.169 --> 52:46.710
It isn't even 1 month
since you joined this college

52:46.752 --> 52:47.877
Just keep quiet

52:48.585 --> 52:51.210
What the hell are they discussing?

52:51.335 --> 52:52.377
I'll be back

52:52.919 --> 52:54.085
I'll talk to JD

52:54.127 --> 52:56.044
Then we will take a call

52:56.085 --> 52:59.169
If he intends coming back
we are resigning, sir

52:59.210 --> 53:01.585
'WTH is this meeting in aid of?'

53:01.669 --> 53:05.085
Sir, I have already given
a commitment I'll resign

53:05.127 --> 53:06.502
I'm just leaving this college

53:06.544 --> 53:08.210
JD, just wait in the car

53:08.252 --> 53:09.669
- 'I need to talk to you'
- Sir...?

53:09.710 --> 53:10.919
I said 'wait'

53:14.169 --> 53:15.335
'I understand'

53:15.377 --> 53:17.252
If they need to know your worth

53:18.002 --> 53:19.544
A gap is essential

53:21.252 --> 53:22.919
Your decision is correct

53:23.127 --> 53:25.085
You wanted a break for 3 months?

53:25.169 --> 53:26.502
I have okayed it

53:28.085 --> 53:29.210
When did I ask?

53:34.669 --> 53:36.127
Isn't this your signature?

53:38.460 --> 53:39.460
Sir

53:40.127 --> 53:41.419
Carbon copy, sir

53:41.460 --> 53:42.919
Oh! Come on, JD

53:43.835 --> 53:46.669
Haven't you opted for a break
of 3 months, intending to teach?

53:46.710 --> 53:48.960
Teach? In which college?

53:49.960 --> 53:51.002
College?

53:51.377 --> 53:53.544
As you have mentioned
Observation Home

53:54.377 --> 53:56.252
Sir, don't play the fool

53:56.294 --> 53:57.710
What will I do there?

53:57.794 --> 53:59.210
I didn't sign this

54:01.085 --> 54:03.544
Maybe after 6:00 p.m?

54:07.585 --> 54:09.210
After 6:00 p.m

54:09.502 --> 54:10.669
Good chance

54:10.960 --> 54:11.960
See

54:12.752 --> 54:15.585
JD, you're losing control on yourself

54:18.919 --> 54:22.669
If there's any issue in the election
didn't you agree to resign your job?

54:23.252 --> 54:25.419
That means you have
something on your mind

54:26.127 --> 54:27.794
Fine, sir, I'll go

54:28.335 --> 54:30.335
Think...I have many 'well' wishers here

54:30.377 --> 54:32.044
This must be their handiwork

54:32.627 --> 54:34.585
It's okay, I need a change too, I'll go

54:34.669 --> 54:38.210
'Inspector is waiting at your place
to explain the job you'll be undertaking'

54:40.252 --> 54:41.502
'That means'

54:42.544 --> 54:43.752
- Needhimani
- Bro?

54:43.835 --> 54:45.419
You didn't pass on any information?

54:45.460 --> 54:46.752
No, bro

54:48.752 --> 54:50.960
Then whatever lawyer sir
and I spoke in the union office

54:51.002 --> 54:53.960
- How did the police get to hear?
- That's what puzzles me, bro

54:56.127 --> 54:58.335
You know this music director Anirudh?

54:58.877 --> 55:01.044
He has composed a new film song

55:01.210 --> 55:02.752
Shall we listen?

55:06.085 --> 55:07.460
- Listen
- 'Bro'

55:07.835 --> 55:10.752
'Bhavani has fixed the date
You are his next target'

55:10.835 --> 55:13.252
'He has decided to kill you too
by framing it on those boys'

55:13.294 --> 55:14.877
What do you say, bigamist?

55:15.544 --> 55:18.044
At least is this your voice
or will you claim its mimicry?

55:18.127 --> 55:20.335
- Bro
- Did you call me, Bhavani?

55:22.002 --> 55:25.752
Make sure the boys are supplied
their regular dose of drinks and drugs

55:26.085 --> 55:28.585
Whether they get
3 square meals a day or not

55:29.502 --> 55:31.710
Booze and dope should flow steadily

55:31.752 --> 55:33.627
Okay, Bhavani
I'll see to it

55:35.377 --> 55:36.377
Where was I?

55:36.419 --> 55:39.252
You got me married and how
can you make my wife a widow?

55:39.919 --> 55:41.169
- Tell me, bro
- Wait

55:41.210 --> 55:44.002
I'm choking with emotion
hearing your sentimental speech

55:48.252 --> 55:49.710
Why are you jerking?

55:50.127 --> 55:53.627
I had tucked the knife in my waist
What if it pierces me in the wrong place?

55:54.169 --> 55:56.877
- Not that
- Suppose an enemy kills us

55:56.919 --> 55:59.669
Doesn't matter if they say
'that's how Bhavani died a noble death'

55:59.710 --> 56:03.169
If they say, 'he had tucked a knife
that stabbed him in a wrong spot'

56:03.210 --> 56:04.502
Does that sound good?

56:04.544 --> 56:06.085
- No
- No, right?

56:06.169 --> 56:07.252
Won't sound good

56:07.335 --> 56:09.210
- Lean back comfortably
- Don't, bro

56:09.252 --> 56:10.919
- Is that a show of respect?
- Yes, bro

56:10.960 --> 56:13.877
How is it over the phone
all this 'bro' kinship is missing?

56:13.919 --> 56:15.127
What is this?

56:15.627 --> 56:17.210
- Lean back
- No, bro

56:17.460 --> 56:19.585
Won't you comply with
your bro's death wish for you?

56:19.630 --> 56:21.671
Lean back...sit...sit...sit!

56:21.736 --> 56:22.903
LEAN BACK!

56:32.627 --> 56:33.919
Dai Gopal!

56:35.294 --> 56:36.794
- Hey
- 'Yes, bro'

56:37.752 --> 56:38.752
Tell me, bro

56:38.794 --> 56:41.502
Ask Das to pick 2 boys
10-15 years old to surrender

56:41.585 --> 56:42.669
- Okay, bro
- Go

56:42.710 --> 56:43.710
Bro...?

56:43.752 --> 56:46.752
A new master has been recruited
for our reformatory it seems

56:46.877 --> 56:48.669
- Okay...so?
- I don't know if you know

56:48.710 --> 56:50.335
I thought I should inform you

56:50.377 --> 56:52.335
A teacher is bound to be appointed

56:52.377 --> 56:55.502
All of you are giving a build up
as if it is Breaking News!

56:55.710 --> 56:58.169
Dispose this body and
ask someone to drive this truck

56:58.210 --> 56:59.419
Okay, bro

57:00.627 --> 57:03.502
"Creep like a lioness, make no sound"

57:03.544 --> 57:06.502
"Slide like a snake, over sun baked ground"

57:06.544 --> 57:07.794
[song 'Rise Up']

57:07.960 --> 57:09.919
Sir, can we switch off that cacophony!

57:09.960 --> 57:12.210
Then shall I wear my coolers?!

57:12.669 --> 57:15.585
"Twist like a hurricane, bend and sway"

57:15.627 --> 57:18.794
"Break like a wave, wash the filth away"

57:25.580 --> 57:30.169
Sir, college students are bound by
certain protocols of parents and society

57:30.210 --> 57:32.335
But those juvenile boys there
lack all that discipline

57:32.377 --> 57:35.794
Their age and their activities
have no connection whatsoever

57:39.752 --> 57:42.335
'Not even a single inmate
is human or humane'

57:42.960 --> 57:44.002
'Beasts'

57:44.419 --> 57:45.460
'Kabaddi'

57:45.585 --> 57:46.585
'Demons'

57:46.627 --> 57:47.835
'Kabaddi'

57:47.877 --> 57:51.335
'They know our law is lenient
to their habitual crimes'

57:51.377 --> 57:54.627
'They use it to their advantage
breaking laws as reckless criminals'

57:55.627 --> 57:56.960
'That's why, I'm telling you, sir'

57:57.002 --> 58:00.169
Don't bend backwards to reform them
in those 3 months you are assigned there

58:02.294 --> 58:05.085
Aren't you wondering
whether to go there or not?

58:05.939 --> 58:06.981
'Sir...?'

58:07.642 --> 58:08.684
'Sir...!'

58:09.960 --> 58:11.710
'Is our hero in dream world?'

58:12.460 --> 58:14.294
Sir, check if that's your phone?

58:15.044 --> 58:16.127
Bro...bro

58:17.044 --> 58:18.294
'Wake up, bro'

58:19.002 --> 58:19.960
Not mine

58:20.002 --> 58:21.210
Oh! Anna's phone

58:21.481 --> 58:23.772
That's no problem, sir
I don't mind going

58:24.044 --> 58:25.710
- I can handle them
- 'Sir'

58:26.127 --> 58:28.294
So have you decided you're going?

58:40.544 --> 58:41.585
Here

58:43.169 --> 58:44.210
Das...?

58:45.044 --> 58:47.335
That teacher will be here tomorrow

58:47.377 --> 58:49.169
Despite knowing about this place

58:49.210 --> 58:51.169
...if he is ready to set foot here

58:51.377 --> 58:52.960
Don't underestimate him

58:53.127 --> 58:54.627
First let him land up

58:54.669 --> 58:56.127
After he steps in here

58:56.460 --> 58:58.710
Let's see if he lasts here
even for half an hour

59:09.335 --> 59:11.210
You should be in there by 10'o clock

59:11.252 --> 59:14.294
If you freshen up
I can take you in my car

59:16.335 --> 59:17.460
In that vehicle?

59:17.710 --> 59:19.002
- Yes
- Okay, you go

59:19.044 --> 59:20.879
- I'll take you safe-
- I'll shower and come

59:20.928 --> 59:21.928
Okay, bro

59:24.794 --> 59:27.210
Life is a pain, hmmm?

59:30.544 --> 59:31.627
3 months

59:46.127 --> 59:48.335
If he comes in and
starts taking a lesson

59:48.377 --> 59:50.335
...ask all of them
to fling these at him

59:51.710 --> 59:52.710
Das

1:00:09.960 --> 1:00:13.002
"Ooooh yeah
You know who it is!"

1:00:15.710 --> 1:00:18.002
"If I'm doin' somethin"

1:00:21.169 --> 1:00:23.877
"Boy...I like to do it well"

1:00:27.544 --> 1:00:29.835
"And when I'm in the zone"

1:00:33.294 --> 1:00:35.960
"Aint nobody stoppin' me"

1:00:36.460 --> 1:00:38.960
"Ooooh yeah"

1:00:40.752 --> 1:00:43.502
"You know who it is"

1:00:47.710 --> 1:00:50.960
Das, look at his stride and beard!
Doesn't look like a master

1:00:51.002 --> 1:00:52.666
Doesn't carry a book or a cane

1:00:52.712 --> 1:00:54.504
He looks so local
Rough & tough

1:00:55.502 --> 1:00:57.377
Let the lamb loiter
Then we can slaughter

1:01:05.169 --> 1:01:07.044
"Oooooh yeah"

1:01:07.085 --> 1:01:08.460
"Master"

1:01:09.294 --> 1:01:11.294
"They call me...master"

1:01:12.127 --> 1:01:14.127
"You know me...master"

1:01:15.544 --> 1:01:17.460
"I'm master the blaster"

1:01:18.627 --> 1:01:19.919
"Master"

1:01:20.752 --> 1:01:22.752
"They call me...master"

1:01:23.627 --> 1:01:25.710
"You know me...master"

1:01:26.919 --> 1:01:29.127
"I'm master the blaster"

1:01:30.877 --> 1:01:33.835
"If you step foot in our place
it is trespassing into our space"

1:01:33.877 --> 1:01:36.627
"We will hassle you to the root
Master, change your route"

1:01:36.669 --> 1:01:39.377
"As carefree boys we roam
in this Observation Home"

1:01:39.419 --> 1:01:42.002
"Tears in our eyes ready
if you ask us to study"

1:01:42.044 --> 1:01:44.585
"Don't take lessons in life
Or ask us to drop our knife"

1:01:44.627 --> 1:01:47.335
"Your lame advice is of no use
We don't want your views"

1:01:47.377 --> 1:01:48.544
"Sir, don't take-"

1:01:49.032 --> 1:01:51.365
Why did you stop singing?
It was such a peppy song

1:01:53.544 --> 1:01:54.710
Wow!

1:01:54.794 --> 1:01:56.835
Song...sketch

1:01:56.877 --> 1:01:59.252
Looks like a bunch of talented boys

1:01:59.382 --> 1:02:00.507
Not bad at all

1:02:01.669 --> 1:02:03.835
Are you setting out to play?

1:02:03.877 --> 1:02:05.252
Why?
What's wrong?

1:02:05.294 --> 1:02:08.627
I don't interfere in the likes
or dislikes of anyone, boss

1:02:08.669 --> 1:02:11.044
Whoever wants to play, go ahead
Want to sit here, be my guest

1:02:11.085 --> 1:02:13.210
'I am allergic to the sun
I'll sit right here'

1:02:13.919 --> 1:02:15.044
Should I teach now?

1:02:15.085 --> 1:02:17.419
- No...no
- We want to play

1:02:17.981 --> 1:02:19.022
Very good

1:02:19.210 --> 1:02:22.544
- 'I must catch up on Amazon, Netflix'
- Shall we give the letter now, brother?

1:02:22.710 --> 1:02:25.085
'I hate the sight of
this classroom, bench'

1:02:25.127 --> 1:02:27.627
- 'I will throw all this out'
- Not now, I'll tell you

1:02:27.919 --> 1:02:32.085
Don't indulge in all this graffiti
on the board, bathroom walls

1:02:32.127 --> 1:02:34.585
You focus on your work
and I'll stick to my job

1:02:34.877 --> 1:02:35.752
Deal?

1:02:35.794 --> 1:02:38.127
We thought of chasing you away
if you took lessons today

1:02:38.169 --> 1:02:39.794
You are unique, master

1:02:39.835 --> 1:02:41.002
He seems to be one of us

1:02:41.044 --> 1:02:43.002
Turned out I'm quite jobless

1:02:43.044 --> 1:02:44.460
Why waste time sitting?

1:02:44.731 --> 1:02:49.106
Why is this place so dirty
and stinking to high heaven?

1:02:49.169 --> 1:02:52.794
We celebrate 10 festivals a year
and 20 birthdays of leaders

1:02:52.835 --> 1:02:55.460
You don't clean up this place
and celebrate on any occasion?

1:02:55.502 --> 1:02:56.710
'Celebrate' means?

1:02:57.294 --> 1:02:58.919
That means-

1:02:58.960 --> 1:02:59.960
Have a blast, huh?

1:03:00.002 --> 1:03:01.085
Right

1:03:01.127 --> 1:03:02.085
Rock on

1:03:02.127 --> 1:03:04.710
We have no idea of day or date
You and your ideas!

1:03:05.210 --> 1:03:06.377
So simple

1:03:06.460 --> 1:03:08.460
Some of you were singing
when I entered, right?

1:03:08.502 --> 1:03:10.460
- Who were they?
- I sang

1:03:10.525 --> 1:03:12.525
What the four of you just sang

1:03:12.567 --> 1:03:14.692
If 40 of you sing in chorus

1:03:14.783 --> 1:03:16.158
That's celebration

1:03:17.671 --> 1:03:20.046
Come with me
I'll show you

1:03:28.544 --> 1:03:29.710
Beat it

1:03:38.377 --> 1:03:42.710
"Let me sing a 'kutti' story
Pay attention, listen to me"

1:03:43.877 --> 1:03:45.544
Why singing in English, bro?

1:03:45.585 --> 1:03:47.210
Just listen, bro

1:03:47.585 --> 1:03:52.085
"Let me sing a short story
Pay attention, listen to me"

1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:56.660
"If you want, take it or else
no need tension, leave it, baby"

1:03:56.835 --> 1:04:02.710
"Life is very short, buddy
Always be happy"

1:04:04.710 --> 1:04:08.419
"100s of problems will come & go"

1:04:08.502 --> 1:04:11.502
"Chill a bit, bro"

1:04:13.419 --> 1:04:14.627
Together, man

1:04:14.710 --> 1:04:19.377
"Let me sing a mini story
Pay attention, listen to me"

1:04:19.627 --> 1:04:24.044
"If you want, take it or else
no tension, leave it, baby"

1:04:24.127 --> 1:04:29.835
"Life is very short, 'nanba'
Always be happy"

1:04:31.127 --> 1:04:35.877
"Problems in many designs will come and go"

1:04:35.919 --> 1:04:38.960
"Chillax and relax, bro"

1:04:40.491 --> 1:04:42.366
No tension, baby

1:04:56.127 --> 1:05:00.294
"If you race at a zip zap zoom speed
concentration is a must indeed"

1:05:00.335 --> 1:05:05.210
"If you crawl at a slow pace
to be steady is a must always"

1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:14.294
"Oh! Anger always misery, baby"

1:05:14.335 --> 1:05:18.877
"Stand united as friends, powerful, buddy"

1:05:18.919 --> 1:05:23.169
"Haters are gonna hate but ignore calmly"

1:05:23.460 --> 1:05:27.627
"Delete negativity totally, baby"

1:05:28.127 --> 1:05:32.335
"Focus on what you dream
and don't worry, mApi"

1:05:32.377 --> 1:05:36.710
"Positivity will lift you, baby"

1:05:37.335 --> 1:05:43.210
"Life is very short, buddy
Always be happy"

1:05:45.169 --> 1:05:52.002
"Very many problems will come and go
Don't be tense, chill a bit, bro"

1:05:54.002 --> 1:05:55.044
Students

1:05:55.460 --> 1:05:59.877
"Let me sing a 'kutti' story
Pay attention, listen to me"

1:06:00.002 --> 1:06:04.669
"If you want, take it or else
no need tension, leave it, baby"

1:06:04.794 --> 1:06:10.252
"Life is very short, buddy
Always be happy"

1:06:11.585 --> 1:06:16.002
"Problems in many a hue will come and go"

1:06:16.502 --> 1:06:19.252
"Take a break, bro"

1:06:21.044 --> 1:06:22.710
No tension, baby

1:06:50.669 --> 1:06:55.085
"Hard work too is necessary
Smart work also is compulsory"

1:06:55.169 --> 1:06:59.877
"Self motivation
Isn't it your reflection?"

1:06:59.919 --> 1:07:04.294
"You need education
Plus total dedication"

1:07:04.335 --> 1:07:08.502
"Try self evaluation
for validation"

1:07:08.710 --> 1:07:13.127
"Don't be the person spreading hatred, mApi"

1:07:13.294 --> 1:07:17.752
"To talk behind one's back is so crappy"

1:07:17.794 --> 1:07:22.085
"Always be polite and just don't be nasty"

1:07:22.335 --> 1:07:26.710
"You be the reason to make someone happy"

1:07:27.002 --> 1:07:32.669
"Life is very short, buddy
Always be happy"

1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:41.752
"Many problems will come and go
Put your feet up, bro"

1:07:43.794 --> 1:07:44.919
One last time

1:07:45.169 --> 1:07:49.669
"Let me sing a 'kutti' story
Pay attention, listen to me"

1:07:49.752 --> 1:07:54.169
"If you want, take it or else
no need tension, leave it, baby"

1:07:54.419 --> 1:07:59.710
"Life is very short, buddy
Always be happy"

1:08:01.377 --> 1:08:06.044
"Problems in many designs will come and go"

1:08:06.169 --> 1:08:09.710
"Breathe a bit easy, bro"

1:08:11.502 --> 1:08:13.627
"That was my 'kutti' story"

1:08:13.669 --> 1:08:15.919
"How was my short story"

1:08:16.002 --> 1:08:18.169
"That was my Lilliput story"

1:08:18.210 --> 1:08:21.835
"How was my 'kutti' story?"

1:08:27.794 --> 1:08:29.169
Go...go...go

1:08:34.241 --> 1:08:35.325
Master

1:08:36.919 --> 1:08:38.669
- Bro
- 'He's asleep, da?'

1:08:38.939 --> 1:08:40.189
Quick, wake him up

1:08:40.650 --> 1:08:41.650
Sir

1:08:42.345 --> 1:08:43.470
Sir

1:08:44.085 --> 1:08:45.169
Sir?

1:08:45.210 --> 1:08:47.419
- Put the letter in his pocket
- He is sleeping, bro

1:08:47.460 --> 1:08:48.794
Just do it

1:08:53.877 --> 1:08:54.919
Hey!

1:08:54.960 --> 1:08:56.794
Who is that tickling me?

1:08:57.752 --> 1:09:00.252
I can hear footsteps, we'll talk
to him over the phone tonight

1:09:00.294 --> 1:09:01.377
Come away

1:09:02.044 --> 1:09:03.710
We shouldn't get caught

1:09:09.294 --> 1:09:12.460
Thank God, only another 89 days left

1:09:12.710 --> 1:09:13.835
Go home

1:09:33.044 --> 1:09:35.127
[whistling]

1:09:40.127 --> 1:09:41.794
Hello, stop

1:09:42.419 --> 1:09:44.460
I noticed just now

1:09:44.502 --> 1:09:47.377
Don't know who played this prank
Why are you riding a cycle?

1:09:47.419 --> 1:09:48.794
I can drop you in my car

1:09:48.835 --> 1:09:50.460
That's alright
I can manag-

1:09:50.502 --> 1:09:54.044
I was hoping at least
you will bring about a change

1:09:54.085 --> 1:09:55.835
Why? It's all going smooth

1:09:55.877 --> 1:09:57.502
The boys are having fun

1:09:58.166 --> 1:10:00.583
We are submerged in problems

1:10:00.627 --> 1:10:03.169
Half the boys are drowning
in a sea of drugs

1:10:03.669 --> 1:10:05.794
Whatever they get
they readily use as weapons

1:10:05.835 --> 1:10:08.169
Everyday some boy or the other
twists his arm or ankle

1:10:08.210 --> 1:10:10.877
Why tell me all these tales?
Am I the police or what?

1:10:11.044 --> 1:10:12.544
I'm just a teacher here

1:10:12.585 --> 1:10:14.377
Sir, you don't understand

1:10:14.460 --> 1:10:17.127
The police will nab the criminals
Court will punish them

1:10:17.169 --> 1:10:18.335
To guide these boys

1:10:18.377 --> 1:10:20.169
To sift and sieve right from wrong

1:10:20.210 --> 1:10:22.460
We are not equipped, sir
They need a master like you

1:10:22.502 --> 1:10:25.210
First understand this is
a reformatory for juvenile delinquents

1:10:25.585 --> 1:10:27.419
'The boys have got into a fist-fight, sir'

1:10:27.460 --> 1:10:30.002
'I am unable to control them
Whoever is out there, come in, sir'

1:10:30.044 --> 1:10:31.710
Yov! Wait, man
I am coming in now

1:10:31.835 --> 1:10:34.794
First close A block and
ensure others don't make it worse

1:10:38.335 --> 1:10:40.169
He isn't picking the phone, da

1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:42.877
'What happened, bro?'

1:10:42.919 --> 1:10:45.169
'I tried 10-15 times
He isn't picking my call'

1:10:45.210 --> 1:10:47.002
'Try again, bro'

1:11:18.169 --> 1:11:19.627
'He isn't picking our call'

1:11:19.752 --> 1:11:22.377
'Do you remember Charu akka's #?'

1:11:23.002 --> 1:11:24.419
'Call her, bro'

1:11:24.627 --> 1:11:25.627
'Hurry up'

1:11:27.627 --> 1:11:30.252
Manikandan speaking, akka
You saw me in the Observation Home

1:11:30.294 --> 1:11:31.377
Someone is coming

1:11:31.419 --> 1:11:33.085
- Switch off the phone
- 'Hello...hello?'

1:11:33.127 --> 1:11:34.377
'Can you hear me?'

1:11:34.419 --> 1:11:35.585
Go, anna

1:12:15.335 --> 1:12:16.544
Enjoy the 'biriyani'

1:12:17.710 --> 1:12:18.919
'Anna...?'

1:12:19.502 --> 1:12:21.669
- We don't want
- Why?

1:12:21.710 --> 1:12:23.127
Not hungry

1:12:23.585 --> 1:12:24.627
Is that so?

1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:27.544
He asked you to eat, right?

1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:32.137
Half baked nutcase!

1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:37.252
How much we have suffered,
starving in this same spot, moron

1:12:39.866 --> 1:12:41.158
Get me some water

1:12:42.710 --> 1:12:44.043
Bro, I'm scared-

1:12:44.085 --> 1:12:46.377
Lucky to get a leg piece in a 'biriyani'

1:12:49.335 --> 1:12:51.002
You can even kill someone

1:12:51.377 --> 1:12:52.877
But not rob him of food

1:12:53.710 --> 1:12:54.918
Go on, eat

1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:03.085
Water

1:13:05.127 --> 1:13:06.127
Enough

1:13:11.418 --> 1:13:13.793
They took my phone, bro
knowing very well it was mine

1:13:18.793 --> 1:13:20.168
Whom did you call?

1:13:20.210 --> 1:13:21.585
No one, bro

1:13:23.191 --> 1:13:24.233
Don't know

1:13:24.460 --> 1:13:25.710
Tell me the truth

1:13:26.002 --> 1:13:27.168
I don't know, bro

1:13:27.210 --> 1:13:29.127
Ma...master, bro

1:13:29.377 --> 1:13:30.543
Who?

1:13:30.627 --> 1:13:32.377
The master who joined duty

1:13:32.460 --> 1:13:34.960
- Master, huh?
- He's a boozer, bro

1:13:35.085 --> 1:13:37.335
You don't have to take him
seriously at all, bro

1:13:40.002 --> 1:13:40.960
Why, 'master'?

1:13:41.002 --> 1:13:42.877
My father died
when I was a kid

1:13:42.918 --> 1:13:45.710
Couldn't bear the hunger
I stole and got caught

1:13:45.866 --> 1:13:48.033
They piled cases on me

1:13:48.081 --> 1:13:50.915
And sent me to this
Ju...Juvenile Home, bro

1:13:51.023 --> 1:13:52.648
We are being released tomorrow

1:13:52.681 --> 1:13:56.556
But he is asking me to surrender
for a murder case, bro

1:13:56.627 --> 1:14:00.210
If my mother gets to know this
she will die of shock, bro

1:14:01.783 --> 1:14:05.824
If you had called me
instead of calling that master

1:14:05.923 --> 1:14:07.548
I'm emotional by nature you see

1:14:07.597 --> 1:14:10.056
I would have assigned
someone else to surrender

1:14:10.460 --> 1:14:12.835
Not wanting to surrender
isn't a mistake on your part

1:14:12.877 --> 1:14:14.960
But you wanted to sneak
our internal information

1:14:15.002 --> 1:14:16.543
Isn't that a grave mistake?

1:14:17.793 --> 1:14:20.085
Grown-up boy, you tell me
What you did was wrong or not?

1:14:20.127 --> 1:14:22.168
- Yes, it was wrong
- So I am right?

1:14:24.085 --> 1:14:25.752
Enough of eating 'biriyani'

1:14:25.793 --> 1:14:28.168
I'll take it
You've had enough

1:14:28.210 --> 1:14:29.418
Here, take this

1:14:29.460 --> 1:14:31.793
Aren't we both very young, bro?

1:14:31.835 --> 1:14:34.793
Think of us as your younger brother
and please forgive us this time

1:14:34.835 --> 1:14:37.960
My dear, only boys like you
should not be pardoned

1:14:38.002 --> 1:14:41.127
They pardoned me
Look how it has shaped me

1:14:41.543 --> 1:14:42.752
How do we deal with this?

1:14:42.793 --> 1:14:45.710
We won't repeat this, bro
We won't snitch to anyone

1:14:47.030 --> 1:14:50.197
Listen, you can be scared
of anyone in this world

1:14:50.374 --> 1:14:52.457
But if death knocks at our door

1:14:52.650 --> 1:14:54.983
...even if it is Lord Yama
you shouldn't be scared

1:14:56.793 --> 1:14:58.252
I'll give you 2 minutes

1:14:58.540 --> 1:15:01.998
Kill me and then save
your brother and yourself

1:15:04.127 --> 1:15:07.002
What were you doing
when these kids stole your phone?

1:15:07.043 --> 1:15:08.877
On top of it you have
this stuck up attitude!

1:15:08.918 --> 1:15:10.627
- Go away
- I won't leave you

1:15:10.668 --> 1:15:12.252
Listen to me
Just run away

1:15:12.293 --> 1:15:13.585
- Run outside
- I won't go

1:15:13.627 --> 1:15:15.793
Mess up all my orders
Only plus is your voice!

1:15:15.877 --> 1:15:16.877
I won't go

1:15:16.918 --> 1:15:18.793
You have only 1 minute left

1:15:18.835 --> 1:15:19.835
Decide fast

1:15:19.877 --> 1:15:20.877
Go away from here

1:15:20.918 --> 1:15:23.335
I won't leave you alone

1:15:32.793 --> 1:15:34.043
'What are you doing?'

1:15:34.460 --> 1:15:35.668
'Don't, bro'

1:15:36.884 --> 1:15:38.800
This is what I expected from you!

1:15:40.002 --> 1:15:41.210
Clear out

1:15:41.293 --> 1:15:42.877
I won't leave you

1:15:51.835 --> 1:15:54.168
Annaaaa...!

1:15:55.460 --> 1:15:57.418
Wake up, bro
Get up

1:15:57.460 --> 1:15:59.960
I'm constable Arumugam
Get up, bro

1:16:00.002 --> 1:16:02.668
School starts only at 10'o clock
Why are you waking me-

1:16:02.710 --> 1:16:04.960
We have a problem on hand
Inspector wants to see you

1:16:05.002 --> 1:16:06.835
Why should I meet the inspector?

1:16:06.877 --> 1:16:09.335
Get up, you are sleeping
not realizing it's an emergency

1:16:09.377 --> 1:16:10.752
Okay, I'll get up

1:16:10.793 --> 1:16:12.668
Don't shake me up like a rattle!

1:16:13.127 --> 1:16:14.335
Go, I'll follow

1:16:15.874 --> 1:16:17.082
'I will come'

1:16:18.627 --> 1:16:21.835
"You say you heard a rumor"

1:16:23.627 --> 1:16:25.627
"And it's time I let you know"

1:16:25.788 --> 1:16:27.038
Start the car, quick

1:16:54.460 --> 1:16:59.710
"If delinquents like us lament in pain
will our voice be heard; or is it in vain?"

1:17:00.460 --> 1:17:01.752
'Not too sure, sir'

1:17:01.793 --> 1:17:03.835
'I think they were here
for less than a year'

1:17:04.668 --> 1:17:09.752
"2 innocent boys here
Lost their lives so dear"

1:17:09.793 --> 1:17:13.085
"To reside here or hang by a rope
One and the same without hope"

1:17:13.127 --> 1:17:15.002
'What are you gawking at, huh?'

1:17:15.181 --> 1:17:16.264
Yov! Who are you?

1:17:16.293 --> 1:17:17.502
- Get out
- Sir...sir

1:17:17.585 --> 1:17:19.043
He is our class master

1:17:19.127 --> 1:17:22.002
Oh! You are that master, huh?
First I have to interrogate you

1:17:22.043 --> 1:17:23.335
What did you do?

1:17:23.377 --> 1:17:24.835
This has never happened before

1:17:24.877 --> 1:17:26.335
Did you hit any of the boys?

1:17:26.377 --> 1:17:27.335
Tell me

1:17:27.377 --> 1:17:29.210
Can't you hear me?
Answer, man

1:17:30.668 --> 1:17:32.960
Sir, what is this?

1:17:33.002 --> 1:17:34.752
Not here, I need to
take him for inquiry

1:17:34.835 --> 1:17:36.835
'Get him into our police jeep'

1:17:36.877 --> 1:17:40.127
'Search all the rooms in case
they left any suicide note'

1:17:40.210 --> 1:17:44.668
"We want to reform given a choice
We are good-for-nothing boys"

1:17:45.168 --> 1:17:51.460
"If delinquents like us lament in pain
will our voice be heard; or is it in vain?"

1:17:55.335 --> 1:18:00.960
"If good-for-nothing louts wail
will our voice make justice prevail?"

1:18:03.293 --> 1:18:05.752
'N2 Police Station
Vadaseri'

1:18:14.585 --> 1:18:17.127
Bhavani, can we come with you?

1:18:17.668 --> 1:18:19.918
He has asked me to come
by myself, I can handle it

1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:22.627
What about...that master
who is in police custody?

1:18:25.174 --> 1:18:27.549
I came out of the reformatory 15 years ago

1:18:27.668 --> 1:18:29.585
Reason I've been patient
for the past 5 years

1:18:29.627 --> 1:18:33.293
I wanted to kill these 3 men and
become the president of the Drivers' union

1:18:33.408 --> 1:18:36.199
2 men are dead and gone
This is the last one to go down

1:18:36.233 --> 1:18:37.566
He has sent for me

1:18:38.002 --> 1:18:39.377
Is he my priority?

1:18:40.085 --> 1:18:41.668
Or is this master important?

1:18:41.710 --> 1:18:42.877
He's only important

1:18:43.043 --> 1:18:45.252
- What shall we do with this master?
- I'll handle him

1:18:45.293 --> 1:18:47.168
- Sure?
- No problem

1:18:47.210 --> 1:18:49.085
- Shall I go now?
- I'll go

1:18:50.127 --> 1:18:51.335
Let's go

1:18:57.627 --> 1:18:58.918
Come with me

1:19:06.918 --> 1:19:07.960
Where are you going?

1:19:08.002 --> 1:19:10.418
- 2 minutes, sir
- Quick, sir will be here anytime

1:19:10.585 --> 1:19:12.585
'Are you the mother of
those 2 boys who died?'

1:19:12.627 --> 1:19:14.502
- 'Yes, sir
- Is that so?'

1:19:14.627 --> 1:19:15.960
'Give him all the details'

1:19:16.002 --> 1:19:17.418
Boozed upto your brow, huh?

1:19:17.460 --> 1:19:20.127
- 'Sit outside
- Okay, sir'

1:19:20.918 --> 1:19:23.085
If someone is calling you
10 times from the same #

1:19:23.127 --> 1:19:25.418
...won't it occur to you
it may be a serious problem?

1:19:25.460 --> 1:19:27.668
No, Ch...Charu

1:19:28.085 --> 1:19:29.460
Why are you staring so blankly?

1:19:29.502 --> 1:19:32.293
I was a volunteer in an NGO
before I took up this post here

1:19:32.877 --> 1:19:36.418
Based on a complaint I went
for inspection to that Observation Home

1:19:36.710 --> 1:19:39.085
That's how I befriended those 2 boys

1:19:40.043 --> 1:19:43.043
They told me about the injustice
in that reformatory

1:19:43.127 --> 1:19:45.877
But I couldn't take
any legal action

1:19:45.918 --> 1:19:47.168
So many vile threats

1:19:47.210 --> 1:19:49.960
The only reason I shifted to Chennai
was to handle such cases myself

1:19:50.002 --> 1:19:53.502
I needed to be financially secure
So I took up this lecturer's post

1:19:54.085 --> 1:19:57.668
When you defended the students
my faith was recharged

1:19:58.168 --> 1:20:01.168
I was convinced this flawed system
could be changed for the better

1:20:03.543 --> 1:20:05.460
I forged your signature for this post

1:20:05.502 --> 1:20:07.918
Even for your job
I was the one who applied

1:20:08.043 --> 1:20:09.668
Even the founder is aware of this

1:20:09.710 --> 1:20:11.877
Now I feel that was a big mistake

1:20:13.793 --> 1:20:17.752
If you hadn't come here
at least those 2 boys would be alive

1:20:19.377 --> 1:20:21.335
Now both of them have left us

1:20:21.418 --> 1:20:23.210
How can you defend yourself, sir?

1:20:28.043 --> 1:20:31.877
See, I had no idea whatsoever
No one told me anything

1:20:31.918 --> 1:20:34.043
When have you been
sober enough to understand?

1:20:34.085 --> 1:20:37.168
Have you ever realized anytime
who is talking to you?

1:20:41.043 --> 1:20:43.168
I have my share of personal problems

1:20:43.210 --> 1:20:45.043
I am unable to come out of it

1:20:45.793 --> 1:20:46.918
I can't

1:20:47.627 --> 1:20:48.835
...cry

1:20:49.585 --> 1:20:52.585
I can't cry, I can't sleep
at night either, that's why

1:20:55.543 --> 1:20:56.710
I drink

1:20:56.793 --> 1:21:00.335
I swear I never thought
it would be this horrific

1:21:00.768 --> 1:21:03.143
Oh! You can never cry, right?

1:21:03.710 --> 1:21:05.710
'I can't understand
Tell me without crying'

1:21:05.752 --> 1:21:06.752
Charu, where are yo-

1:21:06.793 --> 1:21:09.793
- Were your boys into drugs?
- I never thought I would see them dead

1:21:09.835 --> 1:21:12.627
This is the lady who gave birth
to those boys who are dead now

1:21:12.668 --> 1:21:14.085
I had reassured her

1:21:14.127 --> 1:21:15.293
A master will come

1:21:15.335 --> 1:21:17.335
'He will save your boys'

1:21:17.960 --> 1:21:22.293
Both my sons are very fond of each other
They stick together like glue

1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:25.460
My eldest told me
just last week

1:21:25.502 --> 1:21:29.085
'Let my younger brother study
I'll find some job to support us'

1:21:29.127 --> 1:21:31.127
'A master was coming he said'

1:21:31.168 --> 1:21:33.793
He was sure they will be rescued

1:21:33.918 --> 1:21:35.877
But no one came

1:21:36.050 --> 1:21:39.092
'My entire lineage has snapped'

1:21:39.585 --> 1:21:41.377
Yov! Where are you?

1:21:41.543 --> 1:21:42.710
Hurry up

1:21:43.418 --> 1:21:44.710
'Listen to him'

1:21:44.835 --> 1:21:46.085
Bring your wife

1:21:46.293 --> 1:21:48.793
- Yov! Come here
- You can go

1:21:49.210 --> 1:21:50.877
'He has gone back to his old ways'

1:21:50.918 --> 1:21:52.710
- Sir
- Who are they?

1:21:53.127 --> 1:21:55.418
She is that master's colleague it seems

1:21:55.460 --> 1:21:57.460
Pack them all off and
move that master to the cell

1:21:57.502 --> 1:21:58.460
Okay, sir

1:21:58.502 --> 1:22:00.793
Yov! Clear the other cases
out of the station

1:22:00.835 --> 1:22:01.835
Okay, sir

1:22:01.877 --> 1:22:03.502
'What will I do now?'

1:22:04.293 --> 1:22:05.918
'How will I live without them?'

1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:07.710
'Even now you're so hard hearted?'

1:22:07.752 --> 1:22:10.002
Your eyes won't shed tears
till the day you die

1:22:10.181 --> 1:22:11.418
Get even more sloshed

1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:13.918
'Why are you lamenting here?
Shut up now'

1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:15.210
I said shut up

1:22:15.710 --> 1:22:18.668
Do I have to repeat myself?
Clear this place now, madam

1:22:18.710 --> 1:22:19.793
Clear out

1:22:20.002 --> 1:22:21.127
Come with me, sir

1:22:21.877 --> 1:22:22.960
I swear-

1:22:23.002 --> 1:22:25.460
Come along, sir
Standing rooted to the spot

1:22:25.502 --> 1:22:27.543
I swear I didn't expect any of this

1:22:27.585 --> 1:22:30.585
Don't forget you are also responsible
for the death of those 2 boys

1:22:30.627 --> 1:22:32.293
Convey my apologies to their mother

1:22:32.335 --> 1:22:34.918
You are taking undue advantage
of the respect I'm giving you

1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:37.293
Don't make me lose my temper
Stand right there

1:22:37.668 --> 1:22:40.127
I sacrificed my children
in such an awful unjust way

1:22:40.168 --> 1:22:41.752
'Hey! Come here'

1:22:42.043 --> 1:22:45.043
Sir, get some repellent
Mosquitoes are lifting us midair!

1:22:52.168 --> 1:22:53.293
'Go inside'

1:23:19.460 --> 1:23:21.043
Listen, Bhavani

1:23:21.127 --> 1:23:25.293
Only you and I are left to contest
the Lorry Drivers' Union election

1:23:25.377 --> 1:23:27.043
I have to win unopposed

1:23:27.085 --> 1:23:28.627
'Looks like it may rain'

1:23:28.668 --> 1:23:30.460
Can we have tea
and then discuss?

1:23:39.543 --> 1:23:40.752
[sniffles]

1:23:57.710 --> 1:24:00.418
'Master, my name is Sabari'

1:24:00.572 --> 1:24:02.322
'My elder brother is Manikandan'

1:24:02.355 --> 1:24:06.314
'He stole from a bakery for my sake
because I was starving'

1:24:06.710 --> 1:24:10.460
'But they foisted some other case
on us and brought us here'

1:24:10.752 --> 1:24:12.752
'Everything is wrong here, master'

1:24:13.043 --> 1:24:14.877
'They thrash us mercilessly'

1:24:14.918 --> 1:24:17.043
'They stuff some powder into our mouths'

1:24:17.627 --> 1:24:21.460
'Immediately even our teeth
start shivering, master'

1:24:21.835 --> 1:24:24.127
'Don't know if it is day or night'

1:24:24.918 --> 1:24:28.002
'We put up with all this
thinking it is for a short period'

1:24:28.043 --> 1:24:29.668
'Now when we are
about to be released'

1:24:29.710 --> 1:24:32.210
'...they want us to surrender
for some other murder case'

1:24:32.642 --> 1:24:35.377
'Otherwise they are threatening
to kill our mother, master'

1:24:35.418 --> 1:24:40.002
'Charu akka assured us you will come
and be our savior, rescue us'

1:24:40.869 --> 1:24:42.543
'Please save us, master'

1:24:43.127 --> 1:24:44.627
'Our poor mother'

1:24:44.668 --> 1:24:46.275
'She is all alone'

1:24:46.342 --> 1:24:48.092
'Crying nonstop daily'

1:24:48.501 --> 1:24:50.584
'I can't cry anymore, master'

1:24:50.918 --> 1:24:53.585
'Please, brother
Rescue us from this hell'

1:24:53.858 --> 1:24:55.900
'I am begging you, anna'

1:25:16.252 --> 1:25:17.252
Go ahead

1:25:18.210 --> 1:25:19.710
I told you, Bhavani

1:25:19.918 --> 1:25:21.210
I want to win unopposed

1:25:21.293 --> 1:25:23.668
I called you here
to arrive at a compromise

1:25:23.710 --> 1:25:25.418
But still I can't trust you

1:25:26.377 --> 1:25:31.085
You'll take any kind of cruel measure
using those juvenile delinquents

1:25:31.252 --> 1:25:36.168
Should I step out of my house daily
with fear in every breath I exhale?

1:25:38.168 --> 1:25:39.127
That is why-

1:25:39.168 --> 1:25:42.168
Did you call me here
planning to kill me?

1:25:44.502 --> 1:25:45.627
You-

1:25:45.710 --> 1:25:47.835
You call someone
with a plan to kill him

1:25:47.877 --> 1:25:50.585
Treat him royally like a guest
and offer him hot tea

1:25:50.627 --> 1:25:53.668
You're the only man who
asked me for permission to kill

1:25:53.710 --> 1:25:55.710
Instead you could have-

1:25:55.752 --> 1:25:59.293
Putting you on a pedestal, I wanted to
fix an auspicious day to finish you off

1:25:59.335 --> 1:26:01.585
I need my brain examined!

1:26:03.710 --> 1:26:05.210
'Hey! Wait'

1:26:06.043 --> 1:26:07.793
I'll give you 2 minutes

1:26:09.306 --> 1:26:12.347
Kill me and then save
your men and yourself

1:26:34.252 --> 1:26:35.502
'Hurry up'

1:26:37.668 --> 1:26:40.085
Do you need an army
to bash up 1 man?

1:26:40.418 --> 1:26:41.752
Open the door first

1:27:23.752 --> 1:27:25.502
Hey, he is a master
Watch your blows

1:27:25.543 --> 1:27:26.793
You have only 10 minutes

1:27:26.835 --> 1:27:28.543
Come out without too much damage

1:27:29.710 --> 1:27:31.043
Turn the other way

1:27:34.335 --> 1:27:35.627
Murali, come

1:27:35.668 --> 1:27:37.002
Switch it off and come

1:28:01.710 --> 1:28:04.168
Even if you are reborn
pray I don't set eyes on you!

1:28:04.210 --> 1:28:05.835
Don't, Bhavani

1:28:15.752 --> 1:28:17.335
Wonder what their plan is!

1:28:17.939 --> 1:28:21.230
Master, my boss has
given you a bus ticket

1:28:21.293 --> 1:28:23.627
'Luxury bus
Air-condition sleeper'

1:28:23.668 --> 1:28:26.127
Leave tonight, you'll reach
your hometown in the morning

1:28:26.710 --> 1:28:27.793
Got it into your head?

1:28:27.835 --> 1:28:29.752
'If you stubbornly refuse'

1:28:29.793 --> 1:28:31.627
You saw the 2 boys
hanging from the roof?

1:28:31.668 --> 1:28:33.210
You'll be next

1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:35.460
I'm talking to you

1:28:35.502 --> 1:28:37.168
Is that a love letter in your hand?

1:28:39.210 --> 1:28:41.335
Sabari, Manikandan

1:28:41.418 --> 1:28:43.752
[reading under his breath]

1:28:44.168 --> 1:28:48.168
Refusing to surrender in the murder case
and ended up dead, those 2 tramps-

1:29:35.210 --> 1:29:37.752
Sir, the noise is too loud

1:29:39.293 --> 1:29:40.793
Ignore, we'll handle it

1:30:18.210 --> 1:30:19.960
Sir, the noise is ear-splitting

1:30:20.710 --> 1:30:22.210
- Go in and check
- Okay

1:30:42.085 --> 1:30:44.418
'Stab him and rip him apart'

1:30:51.002 --> 1:30:52.043
Sir?

1:30:52.377 --> 1:30:55.043
They may kill that master
Please come here, sir

1:31:03.210 --> 1:31:04.460
Hey Soundar!

1:31:09.085 --> 1:31:10.710
Open the damn door

1:31:21.168 --> 1:31:22.543
Soundar

1:31:43.127 --> 1:31:44.835
- Tell me
- BHAVANI!

1:31:45.835 --> 1:31:47.877
The master-

1:31:55.210 --> 1:31:56.627
Who are you?

1:31:57.002 --> 1:31:59.168
Who is behind this?
What is your motive?

1:31:59.210 --> 1:32:02.543
Why do you use these innocent boys?
I don't know any of this

1:32:03.752 --> 1:32:05.210
But I will find out

1:32:05.918 --> 1:32:08.877
'Hiding behind these young boys and
framing them, neck deep in crime'

1:32:08.918 --> 1:32:11.085
I will catch those sissy fellows

1:32:12.460 --> 1:32:15.543
I'll hunt high and low, find you
and stand right in front of you

1:32:16.085 --> 1:32:17.377
I will-

1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:25.168
I will make you answer
for the death of those 2 boys

1:32:26.877 --> 1:32:28.002
Master

1:32:29.002 --> 1:32:31.918
Whatever I'm about to say
is nothing new for you

1:32:33.095 --> 1:32:35.261
Still I'll say it
and you listen

1:32:38.358 --> 1:32:39.483
I'm waiting!

1:32:41.460 --> 1:32:43.460
[confident laughter]

1:32:44.502 --> 1:32:45.502
Wait, I say

1:32:45.543 --> 1:32:46.835
I will meet you face to face

1:32:46.877 --> 1:32:48.210
"He stands for powerful victory"

1:32:48.285 --> 1:32:49.702
- "Who is he?
- Thalapathy...!"

1:33:07.269 --> 1:33:09.168
'Das, I'm very scared'

1:33:09.210 --> 1:33:11.543
'He is back again
Is there no one to save me?'

1:33:11.585 --> 1:33:13.127
'Aiyaiyo!'

1:33:13.168 --> 1:33:15.752
"Don't spoil for a fight unnecessarily"

1:33:15.793 --> 1:33:18.918
"If you give us hell foolhardily
a stone will split your skull speedily"

1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:21.543
Master, you've been staring
at the rope for a long time?

1:33:21.585 --> 1:33:22.960
Want to play on it as a swing?

1:33:23.002 --> 1:33:24.460
What is that famous song of his?

1:33:24.543 --> 1:33:26.460
Let me tell a 'kutti' story

1:33:26.509 --> 1:33:28.050
Hey chee chee!
Not short, da

1:33:28.085 --> 1:33:29.377
Saaaad story!

1:33:29.511 --> 1:33:31.585
"Let me tell a sad story"

1:33:31.627 --> 1:33:34.335
"Zip lip, or slip
Skip and trip"

1:33:34.377 --> 1:33:36.585
"Chillax, master!"

1:33:38.502 --> 1:33:40.418
"Take a deep breath, master"

1:33:40.460 --> 1:33:42.335
Hey master!

1:33:42.377 --> 1:33:44.627
"Cheers to your beers!"

1:33:51.793 --> 1:33:55.168
'Night and day, the oldest youngster
to the youngest boy, all are doped'

1:33:55.210 --> 1:33:58.043
'When they are intoxicated
they are not in control of their senses'

1:33:58.085 --> 1:34:00.502
'Both have plenty of
criminal cases against them'

1:34:00.543 --> 1:34:02.085
'2 boys who died are sheer poison'

1:34:02.127 --> 1:34:04.127
'Both must have died
when totally tanked, sir'

1:34:04.168 --> 1:34:06.793
'They won't toe the line with
their parents or with our rules'

1:34:06.835 --> 1:34:08.627
They are arrogant boys
who insist their word is law

1:34:08.668 --> 1:34:11.293
'There are 10-12 year olds
with all kinds of diseases here, sir'

1:34:11.335 --> 1:34:12.502
All dazed and doped

1:34:12.543 --> 1:34:15.460
Who told you they were
good-for-nothing boys?

1:34:15.502 --> 1:34:17.252
Both are 24 carat gold, sir

1:34:17.293 --> 1:34:19.460
Both those boys who died

1:34:19.502 --> 1:34:22.043
They called a girl I know
on the night they died

1:34:22.085 --> 1:34:23.877
You mean Charu?

1:34:23.918 --> 1:34:25.168
Yes, Charu

1:34:25.252 --> 1:34:28.585
I know Charu, I also know
who killed those 2 boys

1:34:28.627 --> 1:34:30.335
We have tried our level best

1:34:30.377 --> 1:34:33.585
But we are unable to stop
the dope and booze supply

1:34:33.627 --> 1:34:36.502
How can drugs enter the premises
without your knowledge, sir?

1:34:37.652 --> 1:34:40.548
They have so many routes to supply, sir

1:34:40.604 --> 1:34:42.354
Without the wardens' support

1:34:42.395 --> 1:34:44.354
'...nothing can be brought in, sir'

1:34:44.395 --> 1:34:47.770
As per our rule book, no violence on
our boys who are all below 18 here

1:34:47.812 --> 1:34:50.229
Using that as an excuse
they will bring the roof down!

1:34:50.270 --> 1:34:52.104
Presuming others' fears are their plus

1:34:52.145 --> 1:34:54.229
...these are riff-raffs
who rule the roost

1:34:54.979 --> 1:34:57.895
Poor chaps! Trapped for life
caught in Bhavani's web

1:34:58.858 --> 1:35:00.150
Who is Bhavani?

1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:01.437
Beast!

1:35:01.479 --> 1:35:04.354
- Bhava...Bhavani?
- Don't know anyone by that name

1:35:08.759 --> 1:35:11.395
Sir, don't simply keep asking questions

1:35:11.437 --> 1:35:14.062
You got any other work,
carry on, okay?

1:35:14.104 --> 1:35:15.312
See you, sir?

1:35:15.354 --> 1:35:16.729
Let's go

1:35:45.229 --> 1:35:49.062
'Teachers who came here earlier to reform
these boys, giving priority to their family'

1:35:49.104 --> 1:35:51.354
...would have made a hasty retreat

1:35:51.812 --> 1:35:53.645
But my story is completely different

1:35:54.437 --> 1:35:56.312
I have no one to call my own, sir

1:35:57.354 --> 1:36:01.354
'The day I saw those 2 boys
hang right in front of my eyes'

1:36:02.479 --> 1:36:04.145
Their eyes bulging

1:36:04.770 --> 1:36:06.395
Tongues sticking out

1:36:07.479 --> 1:36:08.729
I died, sir

1:36:12.145 --> 1:36:13.395
If you can help me

1:36:13.437 --> 1:36:15.979
I will change this place and
bring order and fair play here

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:20.354
Whatever hardship comes my way
I don't care even if I lose my life

1:36:20.395 --> 1:36:21.520
"My life's breath"

1:36:21.562 --> 1:36:22.604
I have no problem, sir

1:36:22.645 --> 1:36:26.437
If you stick to rules & regulations here,
even move heaven and earth legally

1:36:26.479 --> 1:36:27.979
I will back you up 100%, sir

1:36:28.020 --> 1:36:31.645
"High time I stop needing a high from you"

1:36:32.354 --> 1:36:38.187
"Enough of (s)tumbling thanks to you!"

1:36:38.847 --> 1:36:43.722
"Today my troubled times will heal anew"

1:36:44.979 --> 1:36:48.062
"Enough of being sloshed night & day
Get it out of your system today"

1:36:48.104 --> 1:36:51.270
"Enough of gifting yourself strife
Switch off this dizzying life"

1:36:51.312 --> 1:36:54.354
"No more booze to give a kick
Quit now, double quick"

1:36:54.395 --> 1:36:57.687
"Break the bottles, you surely should
Trash them for your own good"

1:36:57.729 --> 1:37:02.187
"Enough of being drunk as a skunk
Get it out of your system as junk"

1:37:02.229 --> 1:37:03.812
Forgive me, ma

1:37:03.854 --> 1:37:06.729
"No more daily booze session
Quit this deadly addiction"

1:37:06.812 --> 1:37:09.979
"Break this habit, begin life anew
Trash the bottles now, dude"

1:37:10.020 --> 1:37:12.937
"Enough of this, night & day
Get it out of your system today"

1:37:12.979 --> 1:37:15.979
"Enough of this dependence
Switch off without a fuss"

1:37:16.020 --> 1:37:19.187
"Enough of being a slave to craving
Quit drinking; no more depraving"

1:37:19.229 --> 1:37:23.437
"Break the bottles and the habit
Trash them for your own benefit"

1:37:46.887 --> 1:37:48.221
You got me wrong, Bhavani

1:37:48.239 --> 1:37:49.739
Ever since Gurumurthy died

1:37:49.787 --> 1:37:52.037
...everyone is scared
to contest for that post

1:37:52.645 --> 1:37:54.312
I've spoken to the district councillor

1:37:54.354 --> 1:37:55.562
In another 10 days

1:37:55.604 --> 1:37:57.729
...it will be announced
you won unopposed

1:37:57.770 --> 1:37:58.812
Come here

1:37:59.437 --> 1:38:01.604
Bro, she is the one
putting a spoke in the wheel

1:38:01.645 --> 1:38:04.270
She registered the case it seems
Our boys sent her photo just now

1:38:04.312 --> 1:38:05.812
What should we do with her?

1:38:05.854 --> 1:38:07.687
Can't you handle a female?

1:38:08.187 --> 1:38:10.729
As if you need a priest to choose
an auspicious time! Get lost!

1:38:11.980 --> 1:38:14.812
Bhavani, even if someone else
occupies this post as union leader

1:38:14.854 --> 1:38:18.270
Anyway whatever you say will be law
Then why aspire for this post?

1:38:18.312 --> 1:38:20.854
Fear stemming out of murder is short lived

1:38:20.937 --> 1:38:24.395
But fear derived from a post of power
and authority lasts a lifetime, right?

1:38:25.062 --> 1:38:26.770
After this I'm entering politics

1:38:27.270 --> 1:38:29.770
Don't know how many heads will roll
to make that dream come true

1:38:29.812 --> 1:38:31.895
- I don't get it, Bhavani
- All God's will

1:38:31.979 --> 1:38:33.812
Our boys will shoulder the sin

1:38:43.187 --> 1:38:46.145
"They call me master
Changes will happen faster"

1:39:19.354 --> 1:39:20.395
Hey master!

1:39:20.437 --> 1:39:22.812
- 'Looking tip-top like a new groom?
- Correct, man'

1:39:22.895 --> 1:39:24.270
He looks different, right?

1:39:24.312 --> 1:39:26.354
'Master is in a mood
to teach us a lesson'

1:39:26.395 --> 1:39:27.812
Do you think he's married?

1:39:27.854 --> 1:39:29.354
'If he was married'

1:39:29.395 --> 1:39:30.895
And if his wife looks hot

1:39:30.937 --> 1:39:32.479
Soooper, no?!

1:39:33.270 --> 1:39:35.187
All of you stand height-wise

1:39:35.979 --> 1:39:37.520
Shorter ones in front

1:39:37.562 --> 1:39:39.562
Taller ones back row
Come on, fast

1:39:39.604 --> 1:39:43.145
If you come clean shaven and yell
you think we'll get scared?

1:39:43.187 --> 1:39:46.354
- 'Move on to your next job
- At least pretend to be scared'

1:39:46.395 --> 1:39:47.604
Poor master!

1:39:47.645 --> 1:39:49.520
Let me repeat

1:39:49.562 --> 1:39:50.854
Fall in line
Stand height-wise

1:39:50.895 --> 1:39:54.979
Master, don't judge a book by its cover
Instead of height try weight as a measure

1:39:55.020 --> 1:39:56.729
This chap like a buffalo here

1:39:56.770 --> 1:39:58.770
'Pickpocket case
Real pipsqueak'

1:39:58.812 --> 1:40:01.562
But our little black ant
had the guts to kill

1:40:01.604 --> 1:40:03.562
Cut above the rest
Then who has more weightage?

1:40:03.604 --> 1:40:05.395
What is your name?

1:40:05.437 --> 1:40:07.437
You heard me?
What is your name?

1:40:07.479 --> 1:40:09.312
Master, you can't lay a finger on us

1:40:09.354 --> 1:40:10.604
Know that, right?

1:40:10.645 --> 1:40:11.645
'Sirrrrr'

1:40:11.979 --> 1:40:13.895
You can't hit the boys

1:40:13.937 --> 1:40:14.979
Rules

1:40:15.729 --> 1:40:18.770
'Don't hit them and
get caught unnecessarily'

1:40:19.604 --> 1:40:22.937
'Like a new starched shirt,
sir is all stiff and spruced up'

1:40:22.979 --> 1:40:24.437
"Master's raid, be ready"

1:40:24.479 --> 1:40:26.562
"A-Aa-E-Ee, A-B-C-D
This is our time, buddy"

1:40:26.604 --> 1:40:28.395
"Come, brother, sure and steady"

1:40:32.395 --> 1:40:34.479
It is wrong only if I bash up the boys?

1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:35.604
Yes

1:40:38.729 --> 1:40:41.979
"World famous local master
will bash up any lowlife gangster"

1:40:42.020 --> 1:40:45.395
"His cane will speak loud and clear
To reform a rowdy, law will persevere"

1:40:45.437 --> 1:40:48.645
"If you come in to commit a crime
Master's raid will give you a hard time"

1:40:48.687 --> 1:40:50.145
"Master's raid
Pain postpaid"

1:40:50.229 --> 1:40:52.437
"Don't buy trouble for a fee
Turn your back and flee"

1:40:52.479 --> 1:40:53.979
Why are you hitting us, sir?

1:40:54.020 --> 1:40:55.854
As master, think you can
get away hitting us?

1:40:55.895 --> 1:40:57.270
'We are also wardens here'

1:40:57.312 --> 1:41:00.229
We told you not to hit the boys
So why are you caning us?

1:41:00.270 --> 1:41:02.520
"Don't run over him and look the other way"

1:41:02.562 --> 1:41:04.645
"Don't get into his bad books, stay away"

1:41:04.687 --> 1:41:07.770
"Master's raid, no warranty
Pain 100% guarantee"

1:41:07.812 --> 1:41:09.770
It hurts, sir
Please don't hit

1:41:09.812 --> 1:41:12.562
Sir, I'm going to Sabarimala
I have taken the 48 days vow

1:41:12.621 --> 1:41:16.163
Why? What happened to your devotion
when you were peddling drugs?

1:41:16.229 --> 1:41:19.645
"He'll even the score and more
His blows blast fireworks encore"

1:41:19.687 --> 1:41:21.062
"Who is the master?
Commander!"

1:41:21.104 --> 1:41:22.645
"24 carat gold is he
Lion king royalty"

1:41:22.687 --> 1:41:24.354
"Move aside
Watch his stride"

1:41:24.437 --> 1:41:26.104
"Shut the gate, dude"

1:41:41.937 --> 1:41:43.145
- Name?
- Bharath

1:41:43.187 --> 1:41:44.437
- Sibi
- Karuppusami

1:41:44.479 --> 1:41:45.562
- Dhanus
- 'Udaya'

1:41:45.604 --> 1:41:46.604
- 'Venkatesh
- Stephen'

1:41:46.645 --> 1:41:47.645
'Pencil'

1:41:47.687 --> 1:41:50.104
Inspection it seems
All of you line up to one side

1:41:50.145 --> 1:41:52.770
"He will take law into his hand
When discipline fails to stand"

1:41:52.812 --> 1:41:54.729
"Master's raid will be well planned"

1:41:54.770 --> 1:41:57.104
"When he uses his soft voice
Obey his rules, dear boys"

1:41:57.145 --> 1:41:59.395
"If you defy however slight
his cane will hug you tight"

1:41:59.437 --> 1:42:01.479
"Don't create a ruckus
His warning smile is dangerous"

1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:03.645
"Accept your mistake, bro
he will then let you go"

1:42:03.687 --> 1:42:04.604
Good boy!

1:42:04.645 --> 1:42:06.687
"What was that noise, lad?
Your nose is bleeding bad"

1:42:06.729 --> 1:42:09.020
"Wherever you hide, dude
master's eyes will find you"

1:42:09.062 --> 1:42:11.354
"Listen to master's advice
you'll be wealthy and wise"

1:42:11.395 --> 1:42:13.895
"If you act smart anymore
time to kneel on the floor"

1:42:33.062 --> 1:42:35.104
"Don't stand and stare
Don't get caught again, beware"

1:42:35.145 --> 1:42:38.104
"Hit him once, you are out cold
He will retaliate multifold"

1:42:38.812 --> 1:42:40.812
"Don't turn a blind eye
to a crime on the roadside"

1:42:40.854 --> 1:42:43.104
"Says 'Thirukkural' wisely
Don't chicken out and flee"

1:42:43.145 --> 1:42:45.104
"My followers devotedly
Will be true wholeheartedly"

1:42:45.187 --> 1:42:47.312
"Without discrimination
of caste, race, religion"

1:42:47.354 --> 1:42:48.854
"Apple of our eye is our nation"

1:42:48.895 --> 1:42:53.187
"We were patient till now; simply
But we will retaliate; world war 3"

1:42:53.229 --> 1:42:55.854
"Continents will quake & quiver
Nonentities will shake & shiver"

1:42:55.895 --> 1:42:57.229
"His entry is power
Loud & clear"

1:42:57.270 --> 1:42:58.312
"Who is he?
Thalapathy"

1:42:58.354 --> 1:43:00.104
"24 carat gold is he
Lion king royalty"

1:43:00.187 --> 1:43:02.270
"Move aside, dude
Beast mode"

1:43:04.854 --> 1:43:07.270
'Master, my name is Sabari
My anna's name is Manikandan'

1:43:07.312 --> 1:43:09.062
'My brother stole from
a bakery for my sake'

1:43:09.104 --> 1:43:10.520
'But they foisted another case-'

1:43:10.562 --> 1:43:12.729
'Bhavani, that master is
acting too big for his boots'

1:43:12.770 --> 1:43:14.062
'He bashed up the wardens'

1:43:14.104 --> 1:43:17.562
'He raided the premises and burnt
all the drugs, dopes and phones'

1:43:17.645 --> 1:43:19.395
'What to do with him now?'

1:43:23.562 --> 1:43:25.895
How did a master get to be so gutsy?

1:43:29.645 --> 1:43:32.437
Find out who is backing him up

1:43:40.395 --> 1:43:41.979
Let's get to work

1:43:51.645 --> 1:43:53.812
"Don't stand and stare
Don't get caught again, beware"

1:43:53.854 --> 1:43:56.770
"Hit him once, you are out cold
He will retaliate multifold"

1:43:57.395 --> 1:44:00.062
"Won't turn a blind eye
to a crime on the roadside"

1:44:00.104 --> 1:44:01.604
My dear angels!

1:44:01.645 --> 1:44:03.062
Can you give us a hand?

1:44:03.104 --> 1:44:05.645
"Without discrimination
of caste, race, religion"

1:44:05.687 --> 1:44:07.354
"Apple of our eye is our nation"

1:44:07.395 --> 1:44:11.854
"We were patient till now; seriously
Reign of terror; world war 3"

1:44:11.895 --> 1:44:14.520
"Continents will quake & quiver
Nonentities will shake & shiver"

1:44:14.562 --> 1:44:15.645
"Master spells power"

1:44:15.687 --> 1:44:16.645
Take your hands off

1:44:16.687 --> 1:44:18.479
"24 carat gold is he
Lion king royalty"

1:44:18.520 --> 1:44:20.354
"Move aside, dude
Beast mode"

1:44:22.729 --> 1:44:24.854
Master, you had your way, eh?

1:44:24.895 --> 1:44:26.604
You can trim my hair
or tonsure my head

1:44:26.645 --> 1:44:29.229
Beware of my leader Undiyal
Try your tricks on him

1:44:29.270 --> 1:44:30.395
'Undiyal, listen to me'

1:44:30.437 --> 1:44:32.562
- Don't go there, go to your block
- Shut up, warden

1:44:32.645 --> 1:44:33.979
- Vanakkam, boss
- Morning, bro

1:44:34.020 --> 1:44:36.187
Who had the guts to
lay a finger on our hair?

1:44:36.229 --> 1:44:38.437
Is there a rule on
the long and short of it?

1:44:38.479 --> 1:44:40.812
Master, do you know the rules or not?

1:44:40.854 --> 1:44:43.187
You are having a free hand
with everyone's heads

1:44:44.395 --> 1:44:45.562
Master

1:44:45.604 --> 1:44:47.312
Let go of me, master

1:44:50.270 --> 1:44:52.479
You don't know whom
you're pitting your wits against

1:44:52.520 --> 1:44:54.312
You will regret what you're doing

1:44:54.354 --> 1:44:56.229
"Master's raid
Pain post paid"

1:44:56.270 --> 1:44:58.562
"Don't get into strife
Run for your life"

1:44:58.604 --> 1:45:00.437
"When he uses his soft voice"

1:45:00.520 --> 1:45:02.104
Gawd! You're scaring me!

1:45:02.145 --> 1:45:03.312
- Hey Dheena
- 'Sir'

1:45:03.354 --> 1:45:04.604
Let it be a close cut

1:45:04.645 --> 1:45:05.812
"Master raid"

1:45:05.854 --> 1:45:08.395
"Don't run over him and look the other way"

1:45:08.437 --> 1:45:10.562
"Don't get into his bad books, stay away"

1:45:10.604 --> 1:45:12.062
"Master's raid
All crimes waylaid"

1:45:12.104 --> 1:45:13.229
"Master's raid, da!"

1:45:13.312 --> 1:45:15.687
"A-Aa-E-Ee, A-B-C-D
This is our time, buddy"

1:45:15.729 --> 1:45:18.229
"Bro, good morning
Master's raid in full swing"

1:45:20.354 --> 1:45:22.645
Next week will be
back to square one

1:45:22.687 --> 1:45:24.854
You can come back
and scrub it again, okay?

1:45:24.895 --> 1:45:26.062
Bye, sweetheart

1:45:26.104 --> 1:45:28.979
I've never seen such bad
nicotine stains at so young an age, JD

1:45:29.020 --> 1:45:31.020
Prise open their mouth
it's like a cigarette shop!

1:45:31.062 --> 1:45:34.395
'I have collected cavity samples
from the 6 boys you mentioned'

1:45:34.437 --> 1:45:37.062
- How long will it take?
- I'll let you know in 1 or 2 days

1:45:37.104 --> 1:45:38.354
Thanks, Madhi

1:45:39.788 --> 1:45:42.020
He left me with a half shaved
moustache and beard

1:45:42.062 --> 1:45:43.562
Such a disgrace!

1:45:43.710 --> 1:45:45.229
I feel like I am naked!

1:45:45.270 --> 1:45:46.645
I'm so mad I feel like sta-

1:45:46.687 --> 1:45:48.354
'I feel like stabbing him right now'

1:45:48.395 --> 1:45:50.854
When you get your hands dirty
enemies will come and go

1:45:50.895 --> 1:45:54.229
If we rage like a mad bull against every
single enemy, our life will be ruined

1:45:54.687 --> 1:45:56.145
Handle him with patience

1:45:56.187 --> 1:45:57.937
'Make him run in all 4 directions'

1:45:57.979 --> 1:45:59.562
Don't let him sleep

1:45:59.645 --> 1:46:01.645
- Torture him mentally
- Fine

1:46:01.687 --> 1:46:03.187
- 'Hey-'
- I'll tackle him

1:46:22.104 --> 1:46:24.020
[overlap of angry voices]

1:46:38.520 --> 1:46:40.854
'Listen to me
I'm telling you boys'

1:46:40.937 --> 1:46:42.395
'Listen to me'

1:46:42.437 --> 1:46:43.562
'Wait, da'

1:46:43.604 --> 1:46:45.312
- What happened?
- Sir, I don't know

1:46:45.354 --> 1:46:47.270
They just started a brawl
and hit each other

1:46:47.312 --> 1:46:49.312
Back door is open in A block
What to do now?

1:46:49.354 --> 1:46:50.895
Go look for the key

1:46:50.937 --> 1:46:52.020
Hurry up

1:46:52.062 --> 1:46:53.104
Quick, man

1:46:53.145 --> 1:46:55.062
Don't let anyone out
Lock them up in the class

1:46:55.104 --> 1:46:56.645
- Okay, bro
- Give me the torch

1:46:56.687 --> 1:46:58.437
'You'll get it from me'

1:47:09.645 --> 1:47:11.104
Get lost!

1:47:38.604 --> 1:47:39.687
Hello, bro

1:47:39.729 --> 1:47:42.187
- 'Yes, tell me'
- None of our boys are missing I hope

1:47:42.270 --> 1:47:44.854
Bro, head count is correct 63

1:47:44.895 --> 1:47:46.770
'Not one of them is missing'

1:47:47.354 --> 1:47:49.604
'They came from outside for sure'

1:48:19.145 --> 1:48:20.604
'Aiyo! It's burning!'

1:48:22.562 --> 1:48:24.104
Aiyo!

1:48:26.479 --> 1:48:28.479
You're hurting me

1:48:32.229 --> 1:48:34.604
Aiyaiyo! Bala

1:48:34.687 --> 1:48:36.562
'What happened to you?'

1:48:37.312 --> 1:48:39.020
'You messed up my face, right?'

1:48:39.062 --> 1:48:40.270
'Go, collect your mess'

1:48:40.312 --> 1:48:42.062
'This is just the beginning, master'

1:48:42.104 --> 1:48:43.812
Do something, master

1:48:43.854 --> 1:48:46.520
'Hit them at least once, master'

1:49:21.062 --> 1:49:24.687
Hey master! This is your fate
every single minute you are here

1:49:24.729 --> 1:49:27.854
Don't think this is the end
There's more to come daily

1:49:27.895 --> 1:49:29.854
We will escape from here tonight

1:49:29.895 --> 1:49:31.520
Try to stop us if you can

1:49:44.604 --> 1:49:46.437
'I was on my bike
sticking to the kerb side'

1:49:46.479 --> 1:49:49.729
Whether he collided by mistake
or deliberately targeted me

1:49:49.770 --> 1:49:51.104
'Only God knows'

1:49:51.145 --> 1:49:52.895
'But his intention is to provoke you'

1:49:52.937 --> 1:49:56.187
Only then you'll get angry and show
your fist power on a handful of boys

1:49:56.229 --> 1:49:59.187
'They will use that as excuse
and pack you off from here'

1:49:59.229 --> 1:50:00.979
'Don't act rashly on impulse'

1:50:02.520 --> 1:50:04.812
Only his leg is fractured
Hand is intact, right?

1:50:09.729 --> 1:50:11.937
[kabaddi-chatter]

1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:23.895
'To love one's own child is common
To love someone else's child is divine'

1:50:27.187 --> 1:50:28.687
Sorry, da

1:50:28.729 --> 1:50:30.770
I couldn't do anything to help you

1:50:30.812 --> 1:50:32.229
It's okay, forget it

1:50:32.270 --> 1:50:33.770
What can you do?

1:50:33.812 --> 1:50:36.854
My fear is those grown up boys are
waiting to pounce on us in kabaddi

1:50:36.895 --> 1:50:39.937
And we have to play against
those beefy buffaloes it seems

1:50:39.979 --> 1:50:41.645
In case we lose...

1:50:41.729 --> 1:50:43.604
...we'll be 'alti'
this entire month

1:50:43.645 --> 1:50:44.770
'Alti' means?

1:50:44.812 --> 1:50:46.729
Being an errand boy

1:50:46.812 --> 1:50:49.729
To be under their beck and call
Do all their dirty jobs like a slave

1:50:49.770 --> 1:50:51.270
I'll anyway lose

1:50:51.311 --> 1:50:54.311
'I am agreeable to being an 'alti'
but they insist I should play, master'

1:50:54.354 --> 1:50:56.229
I snitched to you, right?

1:50:56.270 --> 1:50:58.312
Using kabaddi as an excuse
as if it's just a game

1:50:58.354 --> 1:51:00.354
'...they plan to bash me up, master'

1:51:00.655 --> 1:51:02.072
'Hey Undiyal...!'

1:51:02.645 --> 1:51:03.671
Come, da

1:51:05.687 --> 1:51:06.812
Look here

1:51:06.854 --> 1:51:07.854
Look at me

1:51:07.895 --> 1:51:09.145
'I am calling you...dai!'

1:51:09.187 --> 1:51:11.562
Coming or shall I lift you
and bring you here to play?

1:51:11.604 --> 1:51:13.729
More than the aches
from blows and kicks

1:51:14.104 --> 1:51:16.229
Pain from fear hurts deeper!

1:51:16.559 --> 1:51:18.018
Go with courage, da

1:51:18.601 --> 1:51:20.351
Go and check what he's doing

1:51:20.440 --> 1:51:22.315
Das, he is coming

1:51:47.645 --> 1:51:48.604
Tell me, Madhi

1:51:48.645 --> 1:51:50.687
You snitched about us
to the master, right?

1:51:50.729 --> 1:51:52.354
- Face us now
- Hey!

1:51:52.395 --> 1:51:53.812
I know very well, da

1:51:53.854 --> 1:51:56.312
If Bala plays we will win for sure

1:51:56.395 --> 1:51:58.687
So you got scared and
broke his hand, right?

1:51:58.729 --> 1:52:00.604
Had he been here
would he have defeated us?

1:52:00.645 --> 1:52:03.145
For sure then you would
have lost pathetically

1:52:03.229 --> 1:52:06.062
Call how many ever, whomever,
you want from here to play on your side

1:52:06.104 --> 1:52:08.729
I'll call anyone I want but then
you can't go back on your word

1:52:08.770 --> 1:52:11.687
Call, we won't send you back
without breaking all your teeth today!

1:52:14.312 --> 1:52:16.812
MAAASTER!

1:52:18.229 --> 1:52:20.020
"Clash of wills here"

1:52:21.770 --> 1:52:23.729
"You are ready for your bier"

1:52:25.312 --> 1:52:27.020
[song from 'Ghilli']

1:52:28.854 --> 1:52:32.145
"Kabaddi...kabaddi...do hold your breath"

1:52:32.187 --> 1:52:36.437
"Kabaddi...kabaddi...to show your strength"

1:52:43.395 --> 1:52:45.437
- Tell me, Madhi
- 'I checked the results'

1:52:45.479 --> 1:52:48.312
I am sure all 6 of them
are above 20 years of age

1:52:51.729 --> 1:52:53.562
"Kabaddi...kabaddi...play"

1:52:53.604 --> 1:52:57.062
"On your mark, get set full gear
Sandalwood paste smeared"

1:52:57.145 --> 1:53:00.229
"One foot in the grave, no fear
You are ready for your bier"

1:53:00.270 --> 1:53:01.854
What are you saying?

1:53:01.895 --> 1:53:03.830
Not one of them is less than 18?

1:53:03.882 --> 1:53:06.632
100% sure, in those 6 boys
no one is younger than 18

1:53:12.979 --> 1:53:15.187
"On your mark, get set, ready"

1:53:19.895 --> 1:53:21.812
"Bash them up deadly"

1:53:23.229 --> 1:53:26.270
Master, at least do you know
the name of this game?

1:53:26.312 --> 1:53:28.354
'This is not cricket or football'

1:53:28.395 --> 1:53:30.979
You must hold your breath and
repeat 'kabaddi', you know?

1:53:32.395 --> 1:53:34.020
Our rules are different

1:53:34.062 --> 1:53:35.812
You can't just touch and run

1:53:35.854 --> 1:53:37.895
You must toss your opponent
outside the line

1:53:37.937 --> 1:53:39.729
What...still want to play?

1:53:42.229 --> 1:53:43.520
Come on, da

1:53:56.354 --> 1:53:59.645
"Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi...play"

Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi

'Trying your tricks with us?'

"You are ready for your tomb"

1:54:22.754 --> 1:54:25.004
"Your downfall is your doom"

1:54:26.687 --> 1:54:28.062
Bingo!

1:54:28.397 --> 1:54:30.022
'He got a solid slap'

1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:34.150
Knock him down

1:54:54.863 --> 1:54:56.280
'He deserves it!'

1:55:00.187 --> 1:55:02.395
- Soooper, master
- Come...face on

1:55:02.479 --> 1:55:03.770
He is hitting us real hard

1:55:03.812 --> 1:55:05.979
If you have the guts
show it now

1:55:06.062 --> 1:55:08.062
Come...come on

1:55:08.301 --> 1:55:11.051
Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi

1:55:12.145 --> 1:55:14.729
Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi

1:55:14.770 --> 1:55:16.062
Lift him

1:55:16.882 --> 1:55:19.340
You dare lay a finger on us
Just you wait and watch!

1:55:20.812 --> 1:55:22.520
Come...come

1:55:26.604 --> 1:55:29.270
How dare you break a boy's hand!

1:55:29.312 --> 1:55:32.062
This is tit for tat time for you

1:55:32.137 --> 1:55:34.429
It hurts, master

1:55:34.489 --> 1:55:36.281
[loud cheering]

Kabaddi...kabaddi

1:57:03.981 --> 1:57:05.731
Watch the line

1:57:07.624 --> 1:57:11.333
If you dare lay a finger
on these boys just once more

1:57:12.934 --> 1:57:15.517
"Kabaddi...kabaddi...hold your breath"

1:57:15.581 --> 1:57:20.372
"Kabaddi...show your strength"

1:57:21.083 --> 1:57:22.833
Master?

1:57:23.108 --> 1:57:24.400
Master...?

1:57:24.801 --> 1:57:26.701
- What?
- Is it okay to talk frankly?

1:57:26.736 --> 1:57:29.028
- Camera is recording everything
- Go on, doesn't matter

1:57:29.194 --> 1:57:30.403
I'll tell you, master

1:57:30.467 --> 1:57:32.759
My mother passed away
when I was born

1:57:33.064 --> 1:57:35.314
My neighbor akka raised me

1:57:35.747 --> 1:57:38.747
My father asked that sister
if she will sleep with him!

1:57:38.788 --> 1:57:40.038
That's why

1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:42.288
I threw the grinding stone on his head

1:57:42.325 --> 1:57:44.991
Immediately the police put me in jail

1:57:45.580 --> 1:57:47.997
'That's when I got
trapped with Das anna'

1:57:48.038 --> 1:57:51.288
From then on I had to listen
only to what Das anna says

1:57:53.286 --> 1:57:54.452
Das anna will walk in

1:57:54.493 --> 1:57:57.201
He will check who is addicted to drugs

1:57:57.330 --> 1:58:00.247
Powder, smoke, booze
He will increase the dosage

1:58:01.731 --> 1:58:03.481
Which one of you here

1:58:04.663 --> 1:58:06.330
...has seen Bhavani?

1:58:06.372 --> 1:58:07.747
Bhavani?

1:58:07.788 --> 1:58:09.663
Somehow sounds familiar

1:58:09.705 --> 1:58:11.497
'Where have I heard this name?'

1:58:11.538 --> 1:58:12.538
Master

1:58:12.922 --> 1:58:15.797
We have heard this name
But none of us have seen him

1:58:15.872 --> 1:58:18.270
Das anna is 'be all and end all' here

1:58:18.332 --> 1:58:20.040
We must obey him implicitly

1:58:20.067 --> 1:58:22.775
'If he asks us to surrender
we should do so with our eyes closed'

1:58:22.817 --> 1:58:24.067
Otherwise we will be hanged

1:58:24.124 --> 1:58:25.708
'They recently hanged 2 boys'

1:58:25.740 --> 1:58:27.324
'Didn't you see that, master?'

1:58:28.850 --> 1:58:31.309
Do you all want to go home
and live with your family?

1:58:31.389 --> 1:58:32.973
Or do you want to surrender?

1:58:33.038 --> 1:58:35.580
- Go home, master
- Be with our family

1:58:36.372 --> 1:58:38.163
You have been here for 10 days

1:58:38.205 --> 1:58:40.247
We haven't taken to drugs till now

1:58:40.314 --> 1:58:42.314
Only now we know
our own selves

1:58:43.538 --> 1:58:45.788
'Somehow save us from here, master'

1:58:45.830 --> 1:58:49.622
If you follow what I say, you can
go home and live as you wish

1:58:49.663 --> 1:58:50.747
Will you do as I say?

1:58:50.788 --> 1:58:52.872
- Yes, master
- We will

1:58:52.895 --> 1:58:57.603
Whatever you shared with me now
will you tell the same to the magistrate?

1:58:57.747 --> 1:58:59.705
Of course we will, master

1:58:59.747 --> 1:59:02.372
I'll arrange all the formalities
to get them out on parole

1:59:02.455 --> 1:59:03.348
Thanks, sir

1:59:03.420 --> 1:59:05.670
Let the video evidence
be with Charu till then

1:59:05.759 --> 1:59:07.551
It will reach the magistrate
when you say so

1:59:07.592 --> 1:59:11.176
Master, you shot some video
and cleverly made us confess

1:59:11.233 --> 1:59:13.150
You haven't shared your story

1:59:13.192 --> 1:59:14.525
Tell us
Let's listen

1:59:14.598 --> 1:59:15.639
'Ask him, da'

1:59:15.696 --> 1:59:16.863
Cat got your tongue, huh?

1:59:16.897 --> 1:59:18.772
- Tell us
- Tell us, master

1:59:18.830 --> 1:59:20.413
'Please share your story, master'

1:59:20.473 --> 1:59:22.264
We are asking, right?
Please tell us

1:59:22.330 --> 1:59:25.080
Don't ask for trouble
Trust my voice of experience!

1:59:25.122 --> 1:59:26.913
Wait, they are very eager to hear

1:59:26.955 --> 1:59:28.538
I'll be happy to share
Let them enjoy

1:59:28.580 --> 1:59:30.413
I was in college then

1:59:30.497 --> 1:59:32.372
'I think it was my final year'

1:59:32.413 --> 1:59:35.538
A new teacher joined our college

1:59:35.580 --> 1:59:37.372
Her name was Malar

1:59:37.997 --> 1:59:40.413
Unbelievable one in a million 'Love'

1:59:45.330 --> 1:59:47.830
All of a sudden that girl I loved

1:59:47.872 --> 1:59:49.330
...met with an accident

1:59:49.372 --> 1:59:50.997
'She forgot her past'

1:59:51.038 --> 1:59:53.038
She didn't even know who I was

1:59:53.543 --> 1:59:55.876
She even forgot my mad love for her

1:59:55.920 --> 2:00:00.420
Fate made me attend her wedding
present a bouquet with my own hands!

2:00:01.744 --> 2:00:03.036
After tha-

2:00:04.080 --> 2:00:07.080
Dai! Why are all of you
sniffling and crying?

2:00:07.122 --> 2:00:09.330
Now that girl has totally
forgotten our past

2:00:09.372 --> 2:00:11.830
Master, isn't that teacher Charu akka?

2:00:11.872 --> 2:00:14.497
Hey, this akka is teacher
working as my colleague now

2:00:14.538 --> 2:00:16.372
That was my college time

2:00:16.413 --> 2:00:18.747
Down memory lane
Malar teacher

2:00:18.788 --> 2:00:20.663
Dai, don't you watch Malayalam movies?

2:00:20.705 --> 2:00:22.663
If I don't understand the language

2:00:22.705 --> 2:00:23.913
- I won't watch
- Okay

2:00:23.955 --> 2:00:25.788
Getting late
All of you leave

2:00:25.830 --> 2:00:27.913
Class tomorrow morning as usual

2:00:27.955 --> 2:00:29.580
Okay, master
Bye, master

2:00:29.622 --> 2:00:33.413
How much longer will you quote a film story
if someone asks you about your past life?

2:00:33.455 --> 2:00:36.247
Fool yourself in the bargain
and trick others too?

2:00:36.295 --> 2:00:37.879
Which is a film story?

2:00:38.201 --> 2:00:39.285
Don't act

2:00:39.413 --> 2:00:41.372
What you narrated was
Malayalam film 'Premam'

2:00:41.413 --> 2:00:44.239
Copy cats! They stole my story
and it is released, huh?

2:00:44.295 --> 2:00:46.795
One track mind
on plagiarism, huh?

2:00:47.955 --> 2:00:50.580
Okay, what do you want to know?

2:00:50.622 --> 2:00:51.705
Tell me

2:00:51.747 --> 2:00:53.663
Why did you start drinking?

2:00:54.955 --> 2:00:56.788
Every drunkard will have a story

2:00:56.872 --> 2:00:58.330
Why go into it now?

2:00:58.372 --> 2:00:59.663
If I tell you my reason

2:00:59.705 --> 2:01:03.163
...a handful of them
will follow my footsteps

2:01:04.475 --> 2:01:06.350
Is that necessary?
Isn't it wrong?

2:01:06.497 --> 2:01:07.955
Okay...okay

2:01:08.413 --> 2:01:11.090
I won't tell you now
why I got into this habit

2:01:11.158 --> 2:01:13.741
If you like I'll tell you
why I quit, shall I?

2:01:25.888 --> 2:01:31.138
"When we see those eyes of his
won't love automatically bloom in us?"

2:01:31.179 --> 2:01:36.596
"When we go close to him especially
won't our mind skip like a deer joyfully?"

2:01:37.971 --> 2:01:41.513
"Residing in her heart all the time
His style, his stride so sublime"

2:01:41.554 --> 2:01:47.138
"Featuring in her dreams always
24x7 is his charming dear face"

2:01:48.721 --> 2:01:51.596
"He is Mr Handsome truly
He is our Master, one and only"

2:01:51.638 --> 2:01:54.804
"His smile, not too much, not too less"

2:01:54.888 --> 2:01:59.304
"His charisma beams through in excess"

2:01:59.804 --> 2:02:02.497
"His heart is soft as a flower
Youthfulness is his signature"

2:02:02.548 --> 2:02:05.173
"I pity our girls for sure"

2:02:05.208 --> 2:02:07.833
"His smile is like a sparkler
He's good natured forever"

2:02:07.874 --> 2:02:10.458
"This master with his class
covers one and all en masse"

2:02:10.509 --> 2:02:15.634
"If his fire work-glance falls on you
even a failed heart will pass too"

2:02:15.730 --> 2:02:19.105
"He is single, our news a fact
This is your chance to act"

2:02:19.166 --> 2:02:24.249
"When we see those eyes of his
won't love naturally blossom in us?"

2:02:24.291 --> 2:02:28.999
"When we go close to him especially
won't our mind skip like a deer joyfully?"

2:02:29.041 --> 2:02:31.416
JD is an orphan

2:02:31.458 --> 2:02:33.291
Just grew like a wild tree

2:02:33.333 --> 2:02:34.958
Only after joining this college

2:02:34.999 --> 2:02:36.291
'...he met a professor'

2:02:36.333 --> 2:02:39.416
'His friendship and care
changed JD's life altogether'

2:02:39.458 --> 2:02:40.624
V.C.Selvam!

2:02:40.989 --> 2:02:42.958
But unfortunately he had a health issue

2:02:42.999 --> 2:02:45.124
'He got admitted
in a hospital to get treated-'

2:02:45.166 --> 2:02:46.999
That really shattered JD

2:02:47.083 --> 2:02:49.208
After that he was unable to sleep

2:02:49.249 --> 2:02:52.583
'That damn alcohol took over him'

2:02:52.624 --> 2:02:56.166
"Residing in her heart all the time
His style, his stride so divine"

2:02:56.208 --> 2:03:01.458
"Featuring in her dreams always
24x7 is his endearing dear face"

2:03:03.249 --> 2:03:05.541
"He is Mr Handsome truly
He is our Master, one and only"

2:03:05.583 --> 2:03:09.416
"His smile, not too much, not too less"

2:03:09.458 --> 2:03:12.624
"His charisma beams through in excess"

2:03:14.458 --> 2:03:16.999
"Friendly gaze he sweeps
Calm and collected he speaks"

2:03:17.041 --> 2:03:19.666
"No holds barred at all
All of them flip and fall"

2:03:19.708 --> 2:03:22.708
"Magnetic personality
Quick & slick, sharp is he"

2:03:22.749 --> 2:03:24.958
"Our master is always
Top in all ways"

2:03:24.999 --> 2:03:30.416
"Some kind of innate power he displays
Endearing temerity always in place"

2:03:30.458 --> 2:03:33.833
"If he stands solo; which Miss
won't yearn to be his Mrs?"

2:03:33.874 --> 2:03:37.666
"When we see those eyes of his
won't love naturally blossom in us?"

2:03:37.708 --> 2:03:39.249
What-?

2:03:39.666 --> 2:03:41.208
Please move

2:03:48.083 --> 2:03:49.458
Hey!

2:03:57.416 --> 2:03:58.874
Come on

2:04:08.541 --> 2:04:09.583
Tell me, Charu

2:04:09.624 --> 2:04:10.999
Sir, don't know who they are

2:04:11.041 --> 2:04:13.083
'2 or 3 boys are chasing me'

2:04:13.124 --> 2:04:15.499
Charu, where are you?
Which area?

2:04:15.541 --> 2:04:17.666
In Triplicane, Murugan temple

2:04:17.708 --> 2:04:19.749
Road opposite Murugan temple

2:04:25.958 --> 2:04:27.083
Charu?

2:04:27.833 --> 2:04:29.041
Charu...?

2:04:32.491 --> 2:04:33.741
Follow me

2:04:36.541 --> 2:04:37.749
Damn!

2:04:47.249 --> 2:04:50.583
'They started chasing me when I was
on my way to the magistrate's house'

2:04:50.624 --> 2:04:53.374
I don't know what to do
or where to go

2:04:53.416 --> 2:04:54.666
Charu, don't be scared

2:04:54.708 --> 2:04:55.999
'I will send our boys'

2:04:56.041 --> 2:04:58.958
Go inside some shop there

2:04:59.041 --> 2:05:00.749
'Enter a shop to be safe'

2:05:01.666 --> 2:05:04.166
[TV] 'Thank you for calling, Parandhaman'

2:05:05.291 --> 2:05:07.583
- I've come into a shop, sir
- Turn on the speaker

2:05:07.624 --> 2:05:09.333
What do you need?

2:05:09.374 --> 2:05:11.958
'Bro, 1 minute please
Listen to what I have to say'

2:05:12.874 --> 2:05:14.833
'Let this girl hide
in your shop for a while'

2:05:14.874 --> 2:05:16.291
I'll send my men, please

2:05:16.333 --> 2:05:19.208
My business will get affected
Don't involve me, clear out

2:05:19.249 --> 2:05:21.041
Aren't you a fiery blooded youth?

2:05:21.083 --> 2:05:22.541
'Speak boldly'

2:05:22.624 --> 2:05:24.833
Bro, I'll take care

2:05:24.874 --> 2:05:26.541
- 'You don't worry'
- Thank you, anna

2:05:26.583 --> 2:05:28.416
Come here, dear

2:05:44.499 --> 2:05:46.666
- Did a girl come in here?
- No

2:05:46.749 --> 2:05:50.958
"My dark and bold beau
why was he Uncle Scrooge?"

2:05:51.678 --> 2:05:56.137
"He made my heart soft and cottony
quake with desire; explode in rhapsody"

2:05:56.958 --> 2:06:01.458
"Tell me the auspicious time
when wedding bells will chime?"

2:06:01.499 --> 2:06:04.749
[song from 'Pudhu Nellu Pudhu Naathu']

2:06:04.791 --> 2:06:06.916
- Master, they are teasing m-
- Sshhhhhhhhhh!

2:06:07.541 --> 2:06:11.624
"He made my heart soft and cottony
quake with desire; explode in rhapsody"

2:06:13.642 --> 2:06:15.809
'I told you no one came in here'

2:06:17.041 --> 2:06:18.999
'Bro, where are you going in?'

2:06:19.041 --> 2:06:20.083
'Listen'

2:06:20.124 --> 2:06:21.749
'He already told you no one is here'

2:06:21.791 --> 2:06:23.374
Oldie, shut up

2:06:32.041 --> 2:06:33.624
Give it of your own accord

2:06:33.666 --> 2:06:35.708
Or else just 2 punches
I'll smash your face

2:06:35.749 --> 2:06:37.791
If I have to grab it from you-

2:06:37.833 --> 2:06:39.458
- Dai...dai
- Wait, master

2:06:39.499 --> 2:06:41.083
This face looks familiar

2:06:41.486 --> 2:06:42.694
'Akka'

2:06:43.587 --> 2:06:46.504
'Turn your phone towards him'

2:06:48.777 --> 2:06:49.803
Hey Undiyal...!

2:06:49.853 --> 2:06:51.936
'Hey Button, my dear friend!'

2:06:52.661 --> 2:06:53.749
Undiyal, da

2:06:53.791 --> 2:06:55.541
What are you doing
in this video call?

2:06:55.583 --> 2:06:57.833
Dai, the girl you are chasing is my akka

2:06:57.874 --> 2:06:59.541
- 'Your sister?
- Yes, da'

2:07:00.119 --> 2:07:01.619
I didn't know that

2:07:01.653 --> 2:07:04.458
I was asked to finish her
That's way we chased her

2:07:04.499 --> 2:07:06.749
But tell me, why are you chasing her?

2:07:07.936 --> 2:07:10.186
- What is that?
- She has a camera

2:07:10.787 --> 2:07:12.246
I believe she has a camera

2:07:12.291 --> 2:07:14.624
Ask her to give it
and we'll leave

2:07:14.666 --> 2:07:16.874
Akka, give him what he wants

2:07:16.916 --> 2:07:18.559
We will deal with this differently

2:07:18.619 --> 2:07:19.827
'Okay?'

2:07:20.124 --> 2:07:21.749
'Just give it, akka'

2:07:21.791 --> 2:07:25.416
"My eyes can't close at night
without leaning on your chest in delight"

2:07:30.369 --> 2:07:31.619
'Hey Button'

2:07:32.041 --> 2:07:33.999
I told you she's my akka
I didn't hear your apology?

2:07:34.041 --> 2:07:35.833
- Apologize to her
- Sorry, akka

2:07:35.913 --> 2:07:37.538
'Hey! You boys too'

2:07:37.588 --> 2:07:38.796
Sorry, akka

2:07:39.291 --> 2:07:40.666
Glad you are that scared of me!

2:07:40.747 --> 2:07:43.330
Master, end of incident
Akka safe from any accident

2:07:43.379 --> 2:07:45.379
You talk to her
I'll wait there

2:07:46.161 --> 2:07:48.666
Charu, leave that place immediately

2:07:48.708 --> 2:07:51.916
"Trust us even if we are teeny
For you, we get our hands dirty"

2:07:51.958 --> 2:07:55.916
"We can steal a weapon in jail
Chase you, hot on your trail"

2:07:55.958 --> 2:08:00.249
"Chew a gum for flavor
Take the boys you favor"

2:08:00.291 --> 2:08:02.541
Dai, who are all of you?

2:08:02.936 --> 2:08:04.770
What are you doing?

2:08:04.843 --> 2:08:05.968
Look

2:08:07.004 --> 2:08:08.333
What is this tattoo?

2:08:08.374 --> 2:08:09.499
This branding?

2:08:09.541 --> 2:08:11.041
When boys are sent to this Home

2:08:11.083 --> 2:08:14.124
Das anna will pick up
the sharp ones and train us

2:08:14.166 --> 2:08:17.708
When we get released, he will tattoo
our hand with this Tamil letter 'pa'

2:08:17.749 --> 2:08:20.916
If we show this tattoo in the Mess,
we can eat to our stomach's content

2:08:20.958 --> 2:08:23.416
If you are older, you'll get
plenty of booze and cigarettes

2:08:23.458 --> 2:08:25.583
You can get clothes for free
from their textile shop

2:08:25.666 --> 2:08:28.291
They will even get you
dope from a pharmacy

2:08:29.499 --> 2:08:30.708
But the hitch is

2:08:31.249 --> 2:08:34.666
Every now and then, they will
make us surrender for a crime

2:08:34.804 --> 2:08:37.263
Not to get back into the old
bad ways, I'm staying aloof

2:08:41.916 --> 2:08:44.999
'We have heard this name
But none of us have seen him'

2:08:45.041 --> 2:08:47.208
'Das anna is 'be all and end all' here'

2:08:47.249 --> 2:08:48.874
'We must obey him implicitly'

2:08:48.926 --> 2:08:51.124
- Is it a newly released film?
- 'No one can defy him'

2:08:51.166 --> 2:08:53.499
'He asks us to surrender
we should, with our eyes closed'

2:08:53.541 --> 2:08:55.166
How did you lose track of her?

2:08:55.208 --> 2:08:57.583
Don't know how, Bhavani
I sent only professionals

2:08:57.624 --> 2:08:59.458
- Somehow they messed up-
- Shut up!

2:09:02.747 --> 2:09:04.458
What do we do with this, bro?

2:09:04.499 --> 2:09:08.541
It has a card inside which stores
whatever we shoot or click

2:09:08.614 --> 2:09:11.822
Break that card alone and
keep the camera at my place

2:09:12.083 --> 2:09:13.166
Okay

2:09:13.208 --> 2:09:14.958
When are they announcing the results?

2:09:14.999 --> 2:09:16.791
Heard it's Monday or Tuesday

2:09:16.871 --> 2:09:18.704
You'll anyway win unopposed

2:09:18.754 --> 2:09:20.420
Why should you be tense?

2:09:20.877 --> 2:09:23.335
- I can enjoy, right?
- Yes, then what?

2:09:25.879 --> 2:09:27.004
Sit here

2:09:29.837 --> 2:09:31.462
Do you know this ostrich?

2:09:32.083 --> 2:09:34.416
A bird with a long neck like this

2:09:34.458 --> 2:09:36.416
Have you seen its egg?
It will be this big

2:09:36.458 --> 2:09:38.499
So big in size

2:09:39.481 --> 2:09:42.356
But only that ostrich will know
the pain of hatching such an egg!

2:09:43.541 --> 2:09:45.749
Will you sit here even after
I've explained to you?

2:09:45.791 --> 2:09:47.208
No, Bava

2:09:47.319 --> 2:09:48.944
- Get lost!
- No, Bhavani

2:09:49.999 --> 2:09:52.291
Bhavani, boys want a booze party

2:09:52.333 --> 2:09:53.666
You won't anyway drink

2:09:53.708 --> 2:09:55.083
At least for them-

2:09:56.583 --> 2:09:58.667
Drink to dig your own grave

2:09:58.708 --> 2:10:00.958
- Go ahead
- Thanks a lot, Bhavani

2:10:01.417 --> 2:10:03.333
- 'Goodnight, Bava'
- Goodnight

2:10:07.739 --> 2:10:09.792
Somehow you made me
show you this place

2:10:09.833 --> 2:10:12.083
I was staying away
from this place

2:10:12.150 --> 2:10:13.608
Let's go back, master

2:10:14.465 --> 2:10:16.375
Wait, I have a good reason

2:10:16.417 --> 2:10:17.500
We'll go soon

2:10:17.542 --> 2:10:20.000
'Right, you haven't come here to eat'

2:10:20.042 --> 2:10:24.542
- 'What happened to my chicken 'pakoda'?
- Narayana, serve him fast'

2:10:24.583 --> 2:10:27.542
I thought you were inviting me
for a candle light dinner

2:10:27.583 --> 2:10:29.458
Last time I came here,
there was no power

2:10:29.500 --> 2:10:31.042
They had lit only candles

2:10:33.250 --> 2:10:34.792
Okay, relax

2:10:35.875 --> 2:10:37.875
Don't look at this place

2:10:37.917 --> 2:10:40.208
I heard the food here is super

2:10:41.208 --> 2:10:42.792
'Get a token for the meals'

2:10:43.542 --> 2:10:44.792
'Madam, you too'

2:10:45.583 --> 2:10:47.292
I thought we'll have some privacy

2:10:47.333 --> 2:10:50.917
Close your eyes and
show me your right hand

2:10:51.583 --> 2:10:53.583
- Why?
- Show, I'll tell you

2:10:57.417 --> 2:11:00.250
You shouldn't open your eyes
till I tell you

2:11:02.708 --> 2:11:03.917
'Open now'

2:11:07.042 --> 2:11:09.833
That boy's hand in the salon
had this same mark

2:11:09.875 --> 2:11:11.417
Show this over there

2:11:11.833 --> 2:11:13.583
Ask for 'meals' token

2:11:15.458 --> 2:11:16.750
Why should I-

2:11:16.792 --> 2:11:19.167
All for a good reason
Go and show your hand

2:11:53.208 --> 2:11:54.667
Who the hell is he?

2:12:13.250 --> 2:12:15.583
'We don't differentiate or discriminate'

2:12:16.500 --> 2:12:18.875
'Whoever has a Tamil letter 'pa'
tattooed on their hands...'

2:12:18.917 --> 2:12:21.125
...we give them whatever they ask

2:12:23.917 --> 2:12:26.375
Bhavani's boys will take care of the rest

2:12:37.750 --> 2:12:39.167
What is this for?

2:12:39.250 --> 2:12:41.333
Still some balance left
in my bucket list!

2:13:03.042 --> 2:13:07.833
"Let the drums beat; no restraint
Let the party rock; no constraint"

2:13:07.875 --> 2:13:12.917
"Let our army smash and slam
Our earth will quake with the wham"

2:13:12.958 --> 2:13:17.792
"My hands will never miss a beat
when I beat the drum ever so neat"

2:13:17.833 --> 2:13:21.625
"Even the dormant nerve will dance
hearing my drum's resonance"

2:13:21.667 --> 2:13:22.875
'Beat it!'

2:13:22.917 --> 2:13:27.792
"Till the sun rises to a new day
let the ground shake and sway"

2:13:27.833 --> 2:13:32.750
"Till the game is won, job is done
slow down but have your fun"

2:13:32.792 --> 2:13:36.625
"Even the Lord of Death Yama will die
if he glares with his razor sharp eye"

2:13:36.667 --> 2:13:37.708
'Hey boy!'

2:13:37.750 --> 2:13:41.750
"Light the camphor for our Lord
He is possessed by our demi-god"

2:13:42.220 --> 2:13:47.136
"Look high and low diligently
Every nook & corner and alley"

2:13:47.178 --> 2:13:51.261
"There is no other big gun to defy
Or create a ruckus and vilify"

2:13:51.303 --> 2:13:52.428
'Bhavani!'

2:14:06.053 --> 2:14:08.970
That master is churning in my mind

2:14:09.470 --> 2:14:12.136
Tell him to kill that master
tomorrow before day break

2:14:12.345 --> 2:14:15.886
Why wait till tomorrow morning?
We can close his chapter right now

2:14:18.553 --> 2:14:20.845
Shut your gob
Just do what I say

2:14:23.553 --> 2:14:28.220
"Let the force of his punching fist
make the drumhead rip and split"

2:14:28.261 --> 2:14:32.845
"Let 'sound' listen to the thump and lo!
Announce who struck the blow"

2:14:36.928 --> 2:14:38.053
'You there!'

2:14:38.095 --> 2:14:43.136
"Let the force of his punching fist
make the drumhead rip and split"

2:14:43.178 --> 2:14:47.678
"Let 'sound' listen to the thump and lo!
Announce who struck the blow"

2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:52.220
"Shaking his stupor, without a doubt
he is all set to rip your gut out"

2:14:52.261 --> 2:14:56.678
"To hang you upside down
and skin you alive is his vow"

2:14:56.720 --> 2:14:57.970
'Master...!'

2:15:07.970 --> 2:15:12.803
"Let the drums roll; no restraint
Let festivities begin; no constraint"

2:15:12.845 --> 2:15:17.761
"Let our army smash and slam
Our earth will quake with the wham"

2:15:17.803 --> 2:15:22.678
"My hands will never miss a beat
when I beat the drum; it's a royal treat"

2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:26.303
"Even the dormant nerve will dance
hearing my drum's resonance"

2:15:26.345 --> 2:15:27.636
'Rock & roll'

2:15:27.678 --> 2:15:33.095
"Till the sun rises to a new day
let the ground shake and sway"

2:15:33.428 --> 2:15:35.136
Give me Dinkie Dow if you have

2:15:35.178 --> 2:15:36.636
I don't stock drugs

2:15:37.595 --> 2:15:41.303
"Even the Lord of Death Yama will die
if he glares with his razor sharp eye"

2:15:41.345 --> 2:15:42.470
'Hey boy'

2:15:42.511 --> 2:15:46.720
"Light the camphor for our Lord
He is possessed by our demi-god"

2:16:12.970 --> 2:16:15.470
"Got the man with the plan right here"

2:16:15.511 --> 2:16:18.095
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"

2:16:18.136 --> 2:16:22.178
Forward all the videos
to the police department

2:16:22.220 --> 2:16:25.720
I'll bring the boys
to the Magistrate directly

2:16:26.053 --> 2:16:27.136
Okay

2:16:28.595 --> 2:16:29.678
Master

2:16:30.345 --> 2:16:32.261
This is Bhavani anna's truck

2:16:32.303 --> 2:16:34.803
I've heard he comes here often

2:16:36.553 --> 2:16:37.595
Let's go there

2:16:37.636 --> 2:16:40.136
Aiyaiyo! Are you joking, master?

2:16:40.178 --> 2:16:42.636
I am not coming
You go if you want

2:16:45.970 --> 2:16:49.428
"What existed on earth
even before your birth"

2:16:49.470 --> 2:16:52.345
"Even you can't unearth"

2:16:52.970 --> 2:16:59.303
"What happens after our death?
No clue of the aftermath"

2:17:00.553 --> 2:17:03.928
"As long as we live, to the maximum
let's seize the moment, Carpe Diem"

2:17:03.970 --> 2:17:07.220
"What will we lose in the bargain?"

2:17:07.845 --> 2:17:11.011
"What will we lose and not gain?"

2:17:11.053 --> 2:17:12.845
[song from 'Navarathiri']

2:17:15.345 --> 2:17:18.636
"A whole night of merry-making"

2:17:19.095 --> 2:17:22.095
"The day spent in sleep overtaking"

2:17:22.261 --> 2:17:27.303
"This is the world we rejoice
Reveling in unforbidden joys"

2:17:27.803 --> 2:17:30.011
You move I'll stab you

2:17:30.053 --> 2:17:31.386
Walk straight ahead

2:17:38.553 --> 2:17:41.261
"If He considered it a sin"

2:17:41.303 --> 2:17:42.386
Knock, da

2:17:42.428 --> 2:17:44.928
"Will God create man and woman?"

2:17:46.178 --> 2:17:47.553
To top it all
a secret code!

2:17:47.595 --> 2:17:52.345
"Then why would He tempt them anyway
with a grapevine on the way?"

2:17:54.178 --> 2:17:56.678
If any hand reaches out to his weapon

2:17:57.178 --> 2:17:58.761
He will end up a corpse

2:17:59.136 --> 2:18:00.386
Kneel, man

2:18:01.279 --> 2:18:03.279
- Kneel down
- Switch off the song

2:18:04.345 --> 2:18:06.220
Damn, switch it off!

2:18:08.845 --> 2:18:10.470
Who is Bhavani here?

2:18:11.470 --> 2:18:12.511
Huh?

2:18:13.345 --> 2:18:15.220
Which one of you here
has seen Bhavani?

2:18:31.636 --> 2:18:33.761
What kind of sissy name
is that...Bhavani?

2:18:33.803 --> 2:18:36.553
Was he lying on his stomach
as a baby when he was named?

2:18:40.970 --> 2:18:42.095
Phew!

2:18:43.136 --> 2:18:45.053
Let me make it clear once more

2:18:45.803 --> 2:18:49.095
If any of you do something stupid
trying to retaliate

2:18:49.761 --> 2:18:52.261
I'll sign on your man's
Adam's apple, got it?

2:18:52.845 --> 2:18:54.803
'Try your luck flinging another bottle?'

2:18:55.011 --> 2:18:56.511
That means

2:18:56.886 --> 2:18:59.428
You know Bhavani very well

2:19:01.345 --> 2:19:04.345
Will you go and repeat this
to him verbatim?

2:19:05.553 --> 2:19:07.178
Bhavani...Bhavani

2:19:08.053 --> 2:19:09.803
Bhavani...Bhavani

2:19:11.595 --> 2:19:14.636
A man walked in right royally
knowing it is your den, Bhavani

2:19:15.553 --> 2:19:16.720
Repeat, da

2:19:17.220 --> 2:19:19.053
No, you tell me
I'll convey it

2:19:19.095 --> 2:19:21.803
No, you are scared

2:19:22.803 --> 2:19:25.178
'Listen, I might as well tell all of you'

2:19:25.220 --> 2:19:28.261
The day you killed those 2 boys in
the Observation Home and hung them

2:19:28.345 --> 2:19:30.220
I hung my head in guilt and died

2:19:30.886 --> 2:19:33.136
I'm least bothered about myself hereafter

2:19:33.970 --> 2:19:37.011
Branding those juveniles with a tattoo
and making them do your dirty work

2:19:37.053 --> 2:19:38.595
I've put a full stop to it

2:19:38.845 --> 2:19:42.345
From now on, anyone wants to do anything
using the boys as lambs for the slaughter

2:19:42.386 --> 2:19:44.928
...has to kill me and then go ahead
but that has a slight hitch

2:19:45.803 --> 2:19:49.678
I will kill minimum 10 of you
and only then breathe my last

2:19:50.970 --> 2:19:54.261
Be it Bhavani
or Banumathi!!

2:19:55.845 --> 2:19:57.886
Will you go and tell him
word by word?

2:19:58.511 --> 2:20:00.057
Come, get up

2:20:05.220 --> 2:20:06.470
Close the door

2:20:23.761 --> 2:20:25.345
Who threw that bottle at me, da?

2:20:27.970 --> 2:20:29.011
Come here

2:20:29.053 --> 2:20:30.386
No, Bhavani

2:20:30.428 --> 2:20:32.428
I aimed it at him

2:20:32.553 --> 2:20:35.136
The pen will fall down and
you can escape I thought

2:20:35.178 --> 2:20:36.636
'But it missed and-'

2:20:36.678 --> 2:20:38.595
Hey! Lazy lout
Open the door

2:20:38.845 --> 2:20:39.928
- 'Open the door
- Madcap!'

2:20:39.970 --> 2:20:42.303
- Open the door, da
- What false bravado!

2:20:42.345 --> 2:20:44.303
Son of a scumbag!
Open it, damn you

2:20:44.345 --> 2:20:46.928
Where did you go?
Open now, I'll kill you

2:20:46.970 --> 2:20:48.053
'Hey! Open'

2:20:48.095 --> 2:20:50.303
'How dare you lay a hand
on Bhavani when I'm here?'

2:20:50.345 --> 2:20:51.136
- Kottamuthu
- Come now

2:20:51.178 --> 2:20:53.178
- Hey Kottamuthu
- What did you think of us?

2:20:53.220 --> 2:20:54.970
Bro is calling you

2:20:55.011 --> 2:20:56.011
Come here

2:20:57.810 --> 2:21:00.102
- What are you doing?
- He locked us in

2:21:00.638 --> 2:21:02.720
He was holding a knife
to my neck for an hour

2:21:02.761 --> 2:21:04.178
WTH were you doing then?

2:21:04.220 --> 2:21:06.553
Bhavani, that wasn't a knife

2:21:06.595 --> 2:21:09.011
- It was a pen
- You knew it, huh?

2:21:09.053 --> 2:21:11.970
How will he open the door
if you yell after he has gone?

2:21:12.011 --> 2:21:13.386
Shall we pen him a letter?

2:21:13.428 --> 2:21:15.095
'Sir, please open the door'

2:21:18.595 --> 2:21:20.011
Don't hit me, Bhavani

2:21:27.053 --> 2:21:28.261
Who can draw very well here?

2:21:28.303 --> 2:21:29.928
Master, he is our best artist

2:21:29.970 --> 2:21:33.511
He's the madcap who doodles foul stuff
all over the toilet and the walls, master

2:21:35.511 --> 2:21:36.345
'Hi master'

2:21:36.386 --> 2:21:37.845
I believe you came to my den

2:21:38.178 --> 2:21:41.428
Threatened a man with a pen and
conveyed an important message to Bhavani

2:21:41.470 --> 2:21:42.803
I am that Bhavani

2:21:43.053 --> 2:21:43.928
'Vanakkam'

2:21:43.970 --> 2:21:48.636
If you destroy all that I own,
textile shop, hotel, wine shop

2:21:49.261 --> 2:21:52.553
What the hell will he do?
He is himself a criminal

2:21:52.595 --> 2:21:54.886
'You assumed I won't
go to the police, right?'

2:21:54.928 --> 2:21:56.845
Your assumption is 100% right

2:21:56.886 --> 2:21:58.636
But thinking you'll make
a fool of me was wrong

2:21:58.678 --> 2:22:00.136
'I enquired about you'

2:22:00.178 --> 2:22:02.803
I believe you have a big gang
of ardent fan followers

2:22:02.845 --> 2:22:05.636
'Which one of them can I finish off?
I asked my boys their choice'

2:22:05.678 --> 2:22:08.970
They said we can have a jolly time
killing them all without discrimination

2:22:09.011 --> 2:22:11.886
Let me give you a task
Take a pen and paper'

2:22:11.928 --> 2:22:15.595
List out your favorites
in alphabetical order

2:22:15.636 --> 2:22:17.095
Hey Bhavani!

2:22:17.136 --> 2:22:20.178
Don't ignore girls and kids
thinking I'll be soft on them

2:22:20.220 --> 2:22:22.303
Include their names too definitely

2:22:22.345 --> 2:22:24.595
'Write and call each one of them'

2:22:24.636 --> 2:22:26.595
And then...master?

2:22:26.636 --> 2:22:28.345
- Bro...?
- What happened?

2:22:28.386 --> 2:22:29.720
Give me the phone

2:22:29.761 --> 2:22:30.970
'Hello...?'

2:22:31.011 --> 2:22:33.178
- Why did he hang up on me?
- 'Must have got scared'

2:22:33.220 --> 2:22:34.720
Got very emotional I guess

2:22:35.490 --> 2:22:38.532
Why do emotional men
get so hyper and angry?

2:22:43.720 --> 2:22:46.511
Pick...pick...pick up my call

2:22:46.553 --> 2:22:48.386
[phone ringing]

2:22:51.011 --> 2:22:52.303
Pick up

2:22:52.428 --> 2:22:53.720
- Hi, dude
- Where are you?

2:22:53.761 --> 2:22:55.011
I'm just leaving my office

2:22:55.053 --> 2:22:56.761
- You are safe?
- Yes, what's the problem?

2:22:56.803 --> 2:22:58.636
'Listen to me
Don't step out'

2:22:58.678 --> 2:23:00.511
What is the proble-

2:23:01.178 --> 2:23:02.678
Come on, pick up

2:23:03.303 --> 2:23:04.595
- Sir?
- WHERE ARE YOU?

2:23:04.636 --> 2:23:06.136
- Shut u-
- 'You are safe, right?'

2:23:06.178 --> 2:23:07.845
- 'Yes, sir, what happened?'
- Listen

2:23:07.886 --> 2:23:10.720
Check if our batch students
are safe, okay?

2:23:10.761 --> 2:23:12.303
'Madhi, where is Srinath?'

2:23:12.345 --> 2:23:13.386
'He is here, JD'

2:23:13.428 --> 2:23:14.886
- What is it?
- 'Stay at home, don't go out'

2:23:14.928 --> 2:23:16.053
'Everything safe?'

2:23:16.095 --> 2:23:17.095
JD called me

2:23:17.136 --> 2:23:18.761
'He was so hassled'

2:23:18.803 --> 2:23:20.511
'He told us not to step out'

2:23:20.553 --> 2:23:23.428
Guys, don't step out of your house
Most important, avoid road travel

2:23:23.470 --> 2:23:27.220
'In case you are out, go to any house
or shop nearby or any safe place'

2:23:27.261 --> 2:23:29.678
'JD sir called just now
I think there's a major problem'

2:23:29.720 --> 2:23:30.928
'If you are safe'

2:23:30.970 --> 2:23:33.011
For heaven's sake
text our entire group

2:23:33.053 --> 2:23:34.178
Park the bike

2:23:37.553 --> 2:23:40.011
'Almost everyone in the group
texted they are safe'

2:23:40.053 --> 2:23:42.845
But we couldn't reach
only Bhargav and Savitha, sir

2:23:42.886 --> 2:23:44.720
Don't swerve too much to the right

2:23:44.761 --> 2:23:46.261
Careful!

2:23:49.928 --> 2:23:50.803
Hello?

2:23:50.845 --> 2:23:51.886
I am safe-

2:23:54.845 --> 2:23:55.970
Vanathi, where are you?

2:23:56.011 --> 2:23:57.595
In a mall nearby
What happened?

2:23:57.636 --> 2:23:59.386
- Is Prem with you?
- 'Yes, da'

2:23:59.428 --> 2:24:01.386
He has gone to fetch
my purse from the car-

2:24:03.220 --> 2:24:04.303
'VANATHI, WHAT IS IT?'

2:24:04.345 --> 2:24:05.970
'What happened, Vanathi?'

2:24:06.011 --> 2:24:07.886
'VANATHI, TALK TO ME'

2:24:09.386 --> 2:24:10.553
VANATHI

2:24:11.261 --> 2:24:13.303
- 'Where are you, da?'
- Theater, why, sir?

2:24:13.345 --> 2:24:14.720
- Are you alright?
- What happened?

2:24:14.761 --> 2:24:16.011
SIR...!

2:24:16.053 --> 2:24:17.303
SRI DAI!

2:24:18.220 --> 2:24:19.261
SIR!

2:24:20.511 --> 2:24:21.636
Hey!

2:24:22.720 --> 2:24:24.053
Hey! Get out

2:24:24.095 --> 2:24:25.928
- What happened?
- Savitha, go

2:24:25.970 --> 2:24:27.386
'Bhargav'

2:24:27.428 --> 2:24:29.636
BHARGAV!

2:24:29.678 --> 2:24:30.886
'Bhargav...!'

2:24:31.178 --> 2:24:32.345
'SIR!'

2:24:34.720 --> 2:24:36.053
Sir...!

2:24:38.178 --> 2:24:40.386
Bhargav is dead, sir

2:25:09.678 --> 2:25:11.553
"Got the man with the plan right here"

2:25:11.595 --> 2:25:12.886
"Bringin' swag with the-"

2:25:13.595 --> 2:25:14.886
Master

2:25:15.220 --> 2:25:16.803
How many wickets down?

2:25:17.095 --> 2:25:18.178
'According to the News I got'

2:25:18.220 --> 2:25:19.845
2 wickets down
2 retired hurt

2:25:21.011 --> 2:25:24.220
If you are still stubborn enough
to hang out with that gang

2:25:24.261 --> 2:25:26.053
...you'll lose 4 wickets daily

2:25:26.095 --> 2:25:28.928
'I have never forgiven anyone
who has messed with me till now'

2:25:28.970 --> 2:25:31.178
This is my first time
and I am forgiving you

2:25:31.428 --> 2:25:34.845
Just quit your job, do an 'about turn'
and disappear from this town

2:25:35.470 --> 2:25:38.345
'Otherwise one who escaped today
will die tomorrow and repeat'

2:25:38.386 --> 2:25:40.095
It will go on repeat mode

2:25:40.136 --> 2:25:42.636
They will keep falling like ninepins
Thank you and good bye

2:25:42.678 --> 2:25:44.511
Hey...hey!
Master...master

2:25:44.553 --> 2:25:46.553
'The main reason I called you'

2:25:46.595 --> 2:25:48.886
I didn't lie face down
when I was named it seems

2:25:49.095 --> 2:25:50.720
I was on my back
it was clear as a bell!

2:25:50.761 --> 2:25:52.095
- Hey
- 'Aahn'

2:25:52.136 --> 2:25:53.386
- DAI!
- 'Hahn?'

2:25:55.011 --> 2:25:57.470
I'll dice you, dry and
pickle you to pieces

2:25:58.303 --> 2:25:59.428
Let's lock horns!

2:26:04.095 --> 2:26:06.845
Take care of them just for today

2:26:06.886 --> 2:26:07.886
I'll be back soon

2:26:07.928 --> 2:26:09.261
Don't worry, you go

2:26:09.303 --> 2:26:11.303
'I will ensure the safety of these boys'

2:26:15.136 --> 2:26:17.803
- Aiyo! Let go of me, bro
- Shut up, get into the truck

2:26:17.845 --> 2:26:19.595
- Bro, let go of me
- Hit you

2:26:19.636 --> 2:26:20.803
Where are you taking me?

2:26:20.845 --> 2:26:23.178
- I'm not coming, bro
- Das!

2:26:23.886 --> 2:26:25.095
Hey! Come here

2:26:25.136 --> 2:26:26.636
Das, he's throwing a tantrum

2:26:26.678 --> 2:26:28.803
- Lift him
- Don't force me, bro

2:26:28.845 --> 2:26:30.470
- No...no
- Just listen

2:26:30.511 --> 2:26:32.178
Save me, warden

2:26:32.220 --> 2:26:33.470
Don't do this, Das

2:26:33.511 --> 2:26:35.053
Save us somehow, warden

2:26:35.095 --> 2:26:37.095
- Don't take them
- Let me go, bro

2:26:37.553 --> 2:26:38.636
Move it

2:26:38.678 --> 2:26:42.386
'Hey Das! Where are you taking the boys?'

2:26:47.595 --> 2:26:49.720
[mobile ringing]

2:26:50.053 --> 2:26:52.636
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"

2:26:53.303 --> 2:26:55.678
'Hello, sir
I'm Thulukanam speaking'

2:26:55.720 --> 2:26:58.386
'Das and his boys have
locked us in here'

2:26:58.428 --> 2:27:00.470
'He has taken the boys
who turned approvers'

2:27:00.511 --> 2:27:01.928
'In a truck somewhere, sir'

2:27:01.970 --> 2:27:04.678
'We don't know what to do
Please come soon, sir'

2:27:20.220 --> 2:27:21.720
[mobile ringing]

2:27:22.303 --> 2:27:23.470
Yes, Vanathi

2:27:35.518 --> 2:27:38.065
'This is not the end of the world for us'

2:27:39.053 --> 2:27:41.386
You have gone out of your way
for these boys, enough

2:27:41.428 --> 2:27:44.761
'I have informed the higher authorities
They said they will be here soon'

2:27:45.095 --> 2:27:48.095
"He was chewing betel leaves in bliss
I punched his nose without a miss"

2:27:48.136 --> 2:27:51.261
"You should have seen blood gush out
This Amaran's heart is gold, no doubt"

2:27:51.511 --> 2:27:53.595
[Singing a song from 'Amaran']

2:27:53.636 --> 2:27:56.553
"Just utter the name 'Amaran', bro
soda bottles will fly at our foe"

2:27:56.595 --> 2:27:58.178
I don't care two hoots
about the repercussion

2:27:58.220 --> 2:28:01.011
I'll take full blame
Beat the hell out of them

2:28:01.553 --> 2:28:02.553
Hold this

2:28:03.095 --> 2:28:05.178
"It's a lilting tune anyone can hum"

2:28:05.220 --> 2:28:08.386
"Amaran is a seasoned singer awesome"

2:28:08.428 --> 2:28:11.345
"He was chewing betel leaves in bliss
I punched his nose without a miss"

2:28:11.386 --> 2:28:14.178
"Should have seen his nose bleed
This Amaran's heart is gold indee-"

2:28:14.220 --> 2:28:15.428
Master...master, da

2:28:15.470 --> 2:28:16.553
Back again?

2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:18.928
Hey! Wait...wait

2:28:20.053 --> 2:28:21.303
Plan to hit us?

2:28:21.345 --> 2:28:22.470
Go ahead

2:28:29.678 --> 2:28:30.928
Come here

2:28:32.053 --> 2:28:34.386
Think you've achieved
something great in life

2:28:35.886 --> 2:28:37.345
Shout all you want

2:28:38.553 --> 2:28:39.636
Dai!

2:28:41.053 --> 2:28:42.178
Bhargav

2:28:43.428 --> 2:28:44.845
He is dead, da

2:28:50.095 --> 2:28:53.511
Bhargav created much more trouble
in college than all of you put together

2:28:53.553 --> 2:28:54.678
He is dead now

2:28:55.053 --> 2:29:00.345
If a real rowdy reforms and just when
he wants to lead a good life, if he dies-

2:29:00.511 --> 2:29:02.636
Do you know it is
the height of cruelty?

2:29:02.803 --> 2:29:05.636
The faith people around him have,
to turn over a new leaf will vanish

2:29:05.678 --> 2:29:07.011
Oh my gawd!

2:29:07.261 --> 2:29:09.136
Master has started preaching to us

2:29:09.178 --> 2:29:10.220
Ignore them, bro

2:29:10.261 --> 2:29:12.595
Why do you treat them
on an equal footing with you?

2:29:12.636 --> 2:29:14.261
These mongrels won't reform
even if they die!

2:29:14.303 --> 2:29:16.261
Yov! Who will reform?

2:29:16.928 --> 2:29:19.386
When have we treated him with respect?

2:29:19.428 --> 2:29:21.803
Or given him time, place
or an opportunity to reform?

2:29:22.553 --> 2:29:25.553
Undiyal, Odacha Kadalai, Bottle Mani,
Soda Sekar, what kind of names?

2:29:25.595 --> 2:29:28.595
Then how will they remember
their family or tender love and care?

2:29:29.428 --> 2:29:31.345
Family and society alienate them

2:29:31.386 --> 2:29:33.678
If everybody has exiled him
how will he reform?

2:29:36.470 --> 2:29:37.636
Come here, da

2:29:37.970 --> 2:29:39.053
What?

2:29:39.845 --> 2:29:43.095
1st crime by many boys here
is based on emotion quotient

2:29:43.761 --> 2:29:45.886
Affection, betrayal, anger,
or a rush of adrenalin

2:29:45.928 --> 2:29:47.261
Each with a reason

2:29:48.220 --> 2:29:49.470
But after the first time

2:29:49.511 --> 2:29:53.678
You know what instigates you to commit
every crime you pile on to your account?

2:29:54.303 --> 2:29:55.553
Intoxication!

2:29:58.345 --> 2:30:00.136
I can bet on this, da

2:30:00.553 --> 2:30:03.720
All other crimes after your 1st was
committed losing control of your senses

2:30:03.761 --> 2:30:05.886
Didn't you booze?
Didn't you have a ball?

2:30:06.011 --> 2:30:07.386
Oh! Yes, sir

2:30:07.428 --> 2:30:08.595
Open your warped mind!

2:30:08.862 --> 2:30:11.321
Only a drunkard can talk
of how it ruined his family

2:30:11.636 --> 2:30:13.345
Only because of my addiction

2:30:14.303 --> 2:30:16.928
2 boys lost their lives
I got that into my thick head

2:30:17.303 --> 2:30:18.220
I quit drinking

2:30:18.261 --> 2:30:21.053
'Chee! Don't be a drama king, master!'

2:30:21.095 --> 2:30:22.428
Am I brewing liquor at home?

2:30:22.511 --> 2:30:24.178
Blaming the buyer
instead of the seller!

2:30:24.220 --> 2:30:27.720
That's exactly what I'm saying
This intoxication is a political game

2:30:28.761 --> 2:30:31.220
You are not yet 18 years
You can't watch this Adult film

2:30:31.261 --> 2:30:33.553
A security guard stands out
to push you out, right?

2:30:33.636 --> 2:30:35.928
Why is no one standing guard
outside a wine shop?

2:30:35.970 --> 2:30:39.595
How do 10 -15 year olds get hold
of a booze bottle and cigarette?

2:30:40.970 --> 2:30:42.470
Politics

2:30:44.053 --> 2:30:46.886
Bhavani is moving his pawn
and playing this kind of politics

2:30:47.220 --> 2:30:49.428
When the law is against child labor

2:30:49.470 --> 2:30:52.636
...that beast is forcing the same boys
into nefarious activities unwillingly

2:30:56.803 --> 2:30:58.011
What is this?

2:30:58.524 --> 2:30:59.690
What is it?

2:30:59.886 --> 2:31:02.595
Like bribing you to vote and
you end up with an inked finger

2:31:02.636 --> 2:31:05.595
He gives you freebies and
brands you with a tattoo

2:31:06.595 --> 2:31:10.553
He has bathed you in basic amenities
providing free food and clothing

2:31:13.303 --> 2:31:14.803
Good lord!

2:31:16.386 --> 2:31:17.636
Enough of this atrocity

2:31:18.261 --> 2:31:22.386
You have packed those boys who believed
they have a good future into that truck

2:31:23.761 --> 2:31:26.678
Don't know if they will hang from a fan
or be run over by a tyre

2:31:27.720 --> 2:31:28.761
But

2:31:29.636 --> 2:31:31.178
I will save them

2:31:31.636 --> 2:31:33.428
Every single one of them

2:31:39.845 --> 2:31:41.261
What did he say, da?

2:31:41.720 --> 2:31:44.053
He will kill all those who like me?

2:31:44.386 --> 2:31:45.456
Hey!

2:31:45.517 --> 2:31:47.267
[ironical laughter]

2:31:48.386 --> 2:31:51.220
There are zillions outside who like me
Mind, body, heart and soul, da

2:31:54.095 --> 2:31:55.845
Ask him to try his luck

2:31:59.386 --> 2:32:05.303
'Bro, Bhavani has loaded the documents,
money bags of his 'benamis' in his lorries'

2:32:05.345 --> 2:32:07.886
'He is planning to
cross the border tonight'

2:32:08.345 --> 2:32:10.428
'The boys are in one of the trucks, bro'

2:32:21.345 --> 2:32:22.553
Bhavani

2:32:22.595 --> 2:32:24.511
All 40 lorries have crossed the border

2:32:24.553 --> 2:32:26.011
Expected anytime now

2:32:26.886 --> 2:32:28.220
Those boys?

2:32:28.386 --> 2:32:30.803
Das is bringing them in the container

2:33:57.761 --> 2:33:58.845
Go

2:34:35.511 --> 2:34:36.761
Finish her off!

2:34:39.779 --> 2:34:41.196
Vanathi...Vanathi

2:34:44.220 --> 2:34:45.720
Run over her

2:34:46.470 --> 2:34:47.511
Vanathi

2:34:55.011 --> 2:34:56.553
Vanathi, take the wheel

2:36:09.511 --> 2:36:11.220
Come...come

2:36:47.011 --> 2:36:48.636
Bang his car and kill them

2:37:07.553 --> 2:37:09.178
Come...come

2:37:09.720 --> 2:37:10.970
'Stop...stop'

2:37:12.386 --> 2:37:15.261
If those 15 boys turn approvers
whom will they point their fingers at?

2:37:15.303 --> 2:37:16.261
Das of course

2:37:16.303 --> 2:37:18.345
They have never met you, Bhavani

2:37:18.386 --> 2:37:20.220
What if Das turns approver?

2:37:26.521 --> 2:37:27.970
Your name, Bhavani

2:37:28.011 --> 2:37:29.636
Then kill Das

2:37:54.428 --> 2:37:55.470
Go

2:37:55.511 --> 2:37:56.595
Go, da

2:37:57.886 --> 2:38:00.178
Do you want him to kill me
out of your sight?

2:38:00.220 --> 2:38:01.761
Your words came to my mind

2:38:02.345 --> 2:38:04.470
'I will give my life for you'

2:38:05.220 --> 2:38:06.386
Give it now

2:38:09.386 --> 2:38:11.636
I thought of you
as my own elder brother

2:38:12.220 --> 2:38:13.928
I regarded you as my anna

2:38:14.136 --> 2:38:16.761
Even I thought of you
as my very own younger brother

2:38:16.928 --> 2:38:18.303
'What do you want me to do?'

2:38:18.345 --> 2:38:19.636
Where are the boys?

2:38:20.761 --> 2:38:22.303
Where are they, da?

2:38:23.159 --> 2:38:25.909
Hey! Go and check the container

2:38:27.845 --> 2:38:29.553
Go...move it

2:38:47.470 --> 2:38:48.720
Let's see who wins
You or me?

2:38:48.761 --> 2:38:50.261
Das, listen to me

2:38:50.303 --> 2:38:52.220
Listen to me
JUST LISTEN!

2:38:53.470 --> 2:38:54.553
Hear me out

2:38:55.178 --> 2:38:58.761
Oral statement by all those boys
point fingers accusingly only at you

2:38:59.303 --> 2:39:02.095
They don't even know the name Bhavani

2:39:02.136 --> 2:39:03.428
Bhavani knows that too

2:39:03.470 --> 2:39:04.886
Give it serious thought

2:39:04.928 --> 2:39:06.803
Will he kill all the boys?

2:39:06.845 --> 2:39:09.907
Or kill the one they are pointing
fingers at, which is YOU?

2:39:09.967 --> 2:39:12.634
In one swift blow-

2:39:14.714 --> 2:39:16.256
That is not my intention

2:39:16.709 --> 2:39:19.167
Let's stop with the lives already lost

2:39:19.761 --> 2:39:21.678
I'm saying this like a broken record

2:39:21.720 --> 2:39:22.761
Bhavani is clever

2:39:22.803 --> 2:39:25.553
He won't kill the boys
His target is YOU

2:39:26.428 --> 2:39:28.636
Listen to me once
Only this time

2:39:28.678 --> 2:39:32.178
Ask him if you can bring the boys
in front of him he will say 'no'

2:39:32.345 --> 2:39:33.511
Continue to ask repeatedly

2:39:33.553 --> 2:39:35.803
You'll know the true colors of Bhavani

2:39:36.428 --> 2:39:38.011
If this doesn't happen-

2:39:40.345 --> 2:39:42.136
I am all yours to kill

2:41:34.386 --> 2:41:36.303
"Oooooh yeah"

2:41:36.345 --> 2:41:38.095
"Master"

2:41:38.428 --> 2:41:40.470
"They call me...master"

2:41:41.303 --> 2:41:43.261
"You know me...master"

2:41:44.595 --> 2:41:46.178
"I am master the blaster"

2:41:46.220 --> 2:41:47.678
"Ooooooh yeah!"

2:41:47.720 --> 2:41:48.970
"Master"

2:41:49.845 --> 2:41:51.511
"They call me...master"

2:41:53.928 --> 2:41:55.011
Welcome, master

2:41:57.330 --> 2:41:59.580
This is the first time
Real face to face, right?

2:42:03.857 --> 2:42:06.107
Loaded with emotion, huh?

2:42:07.096 --> 2:42:08.305
My dear master

2:42:10.962 --> 2:42:13.003
Bhavani isn't just a name

2:42:13.979 --> 2:42:16.146
It's a kingdom I created for myself

2:42:16.462 --> 2:42:19.670
You can't create a world record
with your overnight lesson

2:42:20.295 --> 2:42:23.462
If he was sharing his pearls of wisdom
what about the mud between your ears?

2:42:25.878 --> 2:42:27.670
You carried that boy on your waist?

2:42:28.397 --> 2:42:30.230
Did you think they are kids?

2:42:31.438 --> 2:42:33.271
They are killers of the worst kind

2:42:35.605 --> 2:42:37.605
I've already given you too much time

2:42:37.638 --> 2:42:39.305
Still I'll give you 2 minutes

2:42:39.815 --> 2:42:42.149
If you can ki-

2:42:44.058 --> 2:42:46.225
Master, why did you hit me in mid speech?

2:42:46.259 --> 2:42:47.759
Didn't you ask for it?

2:42:48.511 --> 2:42:49.595
Come

2:42:49.768 --> 2:42:51.893
Is this all the force you can muster?

2:44:06.553 --> 2:44:07.678
Master

2:44:47.761 --> 2:44:49.720
[fired up laughter]

2:45:21.470 --> 2:45:22.761
Master!

2:45:22.803 --> 2:45:24.803
Get up, master

2:45:26.373 --> 2:45:27.665
Job done and dusted

2:45:29.428 --> 2:45:31.261
'Lord, pardon this sinner'

2:45:37.339 --> 2:45:38.631
Don't!

2:45:41.126 --> 2:45:44.501
Hey! I am fighting here for your sake

2:45:45.261 --> 2:45:48.178
So your hands don't grip
a knife once more

2:45:48.636 --> 2:45:50.011
Your mind

2:45:50.053 --> 2:45:52.386
Your mind should not
go back to its old way

2:45:52.428 --> 2:45:53.886
I am fighting your cause

2:45:53.928 --> 2:45:55.303
Not one of you

2:45:55.845 --> 2:45:58.053
Not even one of you
should raise your hand

2:45:59.470 --> 2:46:00.636
Step back

2:46:02.534 --> 2:46:03.701
MOVE BACK!

2:46:07.573 --> 2:46:12.490
"O master, come to my den
If you don't, I'll force you then"

2:46:13.345 --> 2:46:15.553
[singing a popular song from 'Bommalattam']

2:46:15.636 --> 2:46:17.928
"In my own hot spot
you bet I'm a big shot"

2:46:18.803 --> 2:46:20.345
'How was it?'

2:46:20.508 --> 2:46:22.841
You're teaching a lesson
even when you're about to die

2:46:22.883 --> 2:46:24.341
Is this your last lesson, master?

2:46:25.550 --> 2:46:26.717
'Come'

2:47:04.345 --> 2:47:06.178
Shall we have it this way?

2:47:15.511 --> 2:47:17.011
Show me your fist power

2:47:35.011 --> 2:47:36.636
[whistling]

2:48:08.511 --> 2:48:10.178
- Hey...hey
- Master

2:48:10.428 --> 2:48:13.220
- Take the boys to the truck
- Okay, master

2:48:13.261 --> 2:48:14.470
Hey Das

2:48:42.511 --> 2:48:44.011
'Vaathi...!'

2:48:50.034 --> 2:48:53.409
"Come, my dear dude
Raw banana 'bajji' for you"

2:48:53.470 --> 2:48:56.553
"I will tear your body to tatters
Fry and serve as golden fritters"

2:48:56.595 --> 2:48:59.636
[song from the film 'Thangaikor Geetham']

2:48:59.678 --> 2:49:02.970
"I will tear your body in a jiffy
Fry and serve as bajji"

2:49:25.182 --> 2:49:26.682
Master...master...wait

2:49:29.136 --> 2:49:30.845
Sit down

2:49:35.845 --> 2:49:37.136
Master

2:49:38.384 --> 2:49:40.884
A problem won't be solved
by killing a person

2:49:40.932 --> 2:49:43.141
I asked a man
when I was just 17

2:49:43.650 --> 2:49:45.900
This is the same request
I'm asking you

2:49:46.310 --> 2:49:48.102
Let me live

2:49:49.065 --> 2:49:50.815
I will do anything for you

2:49:51.170 --> 2:49:52.845
I won't harm those boys

2:49:52.971 --> 2:49:56.055
You are the one who made
those innocent children criminals

2:49:57.600 --> 2:49:58.850
One-

2:49:59.857 --> 2:50:01.803
Only 1 year

2:50:01.967 --> 2:50:05.907
You were let into that Observation Home
and you've progressed so much in life

2:50:05.948 --> 2:50:09.657
If you are punished and sent to jail
imagine what you'll do to this town

2:50:15.467 --> 2:50:17.092
I'll get into politics

2:50:18.196 --> 2:50:19.654
I'll start a party

2:50:20.357 --> 2:50:22.149
Will you join me?

2:50:22.863 --> 2:50:24.155
Master

2:50:25.423 --> 2:50:26.506
What?

2:50:26.696 --> 2:50:28.404
Sssshhhhhh!

2:50:51.263 --> 2:50:53.636
[appeased laughter]

2:50:54.920 --> 2:50:56.920
Job done, dusted, dunzo!

2:50:58.951 --> 2:51:00.868
[victorious laughter]

2:51:01.740 --> 2:51:06.323
"Let me sing a 'kutti' story
Pay attention, listen to me"

2:51:07.974 --> 2:51:12.391
"If you want, take it or else
no need tension, leave it, baby"

2:51:14.084 --> 2:51:17.261
"Life is very short, nanba"

2:51:17.303 --> 2:51:19.178
- Master
- Who is that?

2:51:21.034 --> 2:51:22.868
The boys are in the truck, master

2:51:24.391 --> 2:51:26.307
Come here
Sit down

2:51:27.595 --> 2:51:28.636
Sit

2:51:33.986 --> 2:51:36.236
Shall I surrender instead of you?

2:51:38.182 --> 2:51:40.724
Won't you understand till the very end?

2:51:40.970 --> 2:51:44.261
Each person has to endure
the punishment according to his crime

2:51:45.178 --> 2:51:46.220
Madcap!

2:51:46.261 --> 2:51:48.318
I feel I should do something for you

2:51:48.381 --> 2:51:51.298
Tell me if you have a family
I'll take care of them till you're back

2:51:53.097 --> 2:51:56.347
I overheard the children in the reformatory
saying you loved a girl it seems

2:51:57.088 --> 2:51:59.672
A girl from an affluent family
Already engaged to someone

2:52:00.349 --> 2:52:02.182
Shall I go and talk to her?

2:52:03.876 --> 2:52:05.792
Maybe I can share my epic story!

2:52:05.865 --> 2:52:08.073
Listen, my dear boy

2:52:08.678 --> 2:52:10.553
My name was not JD then

2:52:10.888 --> 2:52:12.221
Jack Daniels

2:52:12.673 --> 2:52:15.006
People called me 'Jack'

2:52:15.506 --> 2:52:16.803
I used to draw well

2:52:16.845 --> 2:52:18.428
Good at a game of cards

2:52:18.970 --> 2:52:23.178
In such a game we were lucky
My friend and I won 2 tickets

2:52:24.123 --> 2:52:27.415
You would have seen everyone
run to catch a bus or train

2:52:27.803 --> 2:52:31.261
But imagine we ran and caught a ship
about to leave the dock

2:52:31.751 --> 2:52:33.084
Hahn?

2:52:33.595 --> 2:52:36.470
That's where I set eyes on her
for the very 1st time

2:52:36.636 --> 2:52:38.470
Her name was Rose

2:52:40.345 --> 2:52:42.053
What did you say her name was?

2:52:42.970 --> 2:52:44.053
Rose

2:52:44.220 --> 2:52:45.970
Rose...Jack

2:52:46.011 --> 2:52:47.595
Listen to my love story

2:52:47.636 --> 2:52:50.053
After I fell head over heels
in love with her, I found out

2:52:50.095 --> 2:52:52.011
...she's already engaged

2:52:53.053 --> 2:52:55.928
After that, as we were sailing smoothly

2:52:55.970 --> 2:52:58.178
The ship hit an iceberg on the way?

2:52:59.525 --> 2:53:00.608
How do you know that?

2:53:00.657 --> 2:53:02.323
I'll wait outside, master

2:53:02.380 --> 2:53:05.338
- Listen to my full epic love story
- No need, it's okay, master

2:53:07.607 --> 2:53:11.178
'Since manipulation of boys into crimes
by anti social elements was proved'

2:53:11.220 --> 2:53:12.970
'With the aid of proper evidence'

2:53:13.011 --> 2:53:15.386
'That specific Govt Reformatory
was shut down permanently'

2:53:15.428 --> 2:53:19.720
'Of the 63 inmates, those above 18
were sent to Central Prison'

2:53:19.761 --> 2:53:23.553
'And those below 18 were sent
to other Govt reformatories'

2:53:24.172 --> 2:53:25.672
Your fingerprint over there

2:53:27.915 --> 2:53:28.975
Go inside

2:53:35.623 --> 2:53:37.873
What is the crime you are serving term for?

2:53:38.415 --> 2:53:41.582
Baby face, partner
Must be a gigolo

2:53:41.623 --> 2:53:43.915
Look at his face
Like a parcel folded into four

2:53:43.957 --> 2:53:47.082
Juveniles of Nagercoil
in that Bhavani case

2:53:47.373 --> 2:53:49.582
I heard it was 7 of them
Only 6 are here

2:53:49.623 --> 2:53:52.457
Baby face is here
Handsome face is missing

2:53:52.498 --> 2:53:53.701
Where is your master?

2:53:53.758 --> 2:53:56.091
Must have been sent to Vellore jail

2:54:01.582 --> 2:54:03.115
It's even more convenient, partner

2:54:03.167 --> 2:54:05.708
We go to Vellore in 10 days
We'll finish him there

2:54:05.789 --> 2:54:08.289
Then we will meet your master in Vellore

2:54:11.207 --> 2:54:12.665
Transfer only after 10 days, huh?

2:54:12.707 --> 2:54:14.748
- Are you here till then?
- Why?

2:54:14.790 --> 2:54:16.388
Drag that 'beedi'
deep into your lungs

2:54:16.441 --> 2:54:18.441
This is the last 'beedi' you'll smoke

2:54:19.040 --> 2:54:20.582
Over dramatic punch line!

2:54:20.623 --> 2:54:22.582
You're teaching ME
about the 'prisoner'!!

2:54:22.915 --> 2:54:24.670
You would have seen
notorious prisoners

2:54:24.712 --> 2:54:26.212
But guess who is coming now

2:54:26.433 --> 2:54:27.558
MASTER

2:54:27.591 --> 2:54:28.633
"Master coming!"

2:54:28.667 --> 2:54:29.792
"Move aside!"

2:54:34.516 --> 2:54:36.141

"Master coming!"

2:55:21.091 --> 2:55:22.341
"Move aside!"

2:55:26.540 --> 2:55:28.040
'Rock & roll!'

2:55:36.207 --> 2:55:38.998
"It will boomerang on you centuple"

2:55:39.040 --> 2:55:41.748

Scare them to scatter"

Aiyo!

"Tear them to tatters
Scare them to scatter"

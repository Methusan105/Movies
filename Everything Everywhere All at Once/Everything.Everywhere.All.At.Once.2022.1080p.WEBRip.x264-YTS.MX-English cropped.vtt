1
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:04.613
Waymond!

2
00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:07.016
Waymond!

3
00:00:09.184 --> 00:00:10.953
I'm sorry. Evelyn.

4
00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:12.621
- Huh?
- I need to go.

5
00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:13.856
What?

6
00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.791
I need to find the right Evelyn.

7
00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:17.893
And this one.

8
00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:19.728
it's not the one.

9
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.264
No! No. Wait. let me try again!

10
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.768
Alpha Waymond?

11
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:27.903
Evelyn?!

12
00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:31.740
- Oh.
- Huh?

13
00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.611
Ah! What's happened to my hand?

14
00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:43.152
Go. go. go. go!

15
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:47.056
Evelyn. your face.

16
00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.791
You just left me.

17
00:00:48.824 --> 00:00:50.993
You just left me!

18
00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:34.468
Waymond...

19
00:01:36.538 --> 00:01:38.440
Miss Deirdre?

20
00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:40.275
- I love you!
- What?

21
00:01:41.943 --> 00:01:43.178
I love you!

22
00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:45.648
No. no!

23
00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:49.752
I love you!

24
00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:08.637
I love you!

25
00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:16.779
I love...

26
00:02:37.732 --> 00:02:39.468
Evelyn!

27
00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:06.595
Cut. cut. cut. cut!

28
00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:16.038
Oh. I'm so
happy to be here today.

29
00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:18.507
- Evelyn!
- Evelyn!

30
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.742
Evelyn!

31
00:04:00.482 --> 00:04:02.117
Oh!

32
00:04:15.697 --> 00:04:18.534
Why did you... How?

33
00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:32.381
It was beautiful.

34
00:04:44.592 --> 00:04:45.928
Waymond.

35
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.463
We better keep moving.

36
00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.901
Now you've definitely
got Jobu's attention. Come on.

37
00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:04.713
Stay calm.

38
00:05:04.746 --> 00:05:07.716
Your brain is under
an incredible amount of stress.

39
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.419
No. let me finish
talking with my husband.

40
00:05:10.452 --> 00:05:13.188
He needs to know how good
my life could have been.

41
00:05:14.656 --> 00:05:16.992
- Evelyn! Evelyn!
- Evelyn!

42
00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:23.465
- Ow!
- Are you with me?

43
00:05:24.232 --> 00:05:26.268
I thought I was disconnected.

44
00:05:26.301 --> 00:05:27.736
Why was I still there?

45
00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:30.572
Your mind. it's like
a Clay pot holding water.

46
00:05:30.605 --> 00:05:32.374
Every jump opens another crack.

47
00:05:32.407 --> 00:05:33.976
causing things to leak through.

48
00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.679
With training. you will learn
to reseal these cracks.

49
00:05:38.446 --> 00:05:40.683
Eat. You need energy.

50
00:05:43.118 --> 00:05:44.620
Cream cheese.

51
00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:47.756
Mmm!

52
00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.193
In my universe.
the cattle were killed off.

53
00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.794
One of the many things
we've lost

54
00:05:52.827 --> 00:05:54.663
in our war against Jobu.

55
00:05:57.198 --> 00:05:58.934
Oh. my God.

56
00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:00.469
What if...

57
00:06:01.302 --> 00:06:03.105
what if I want to go back?

58
00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:06.575
What if I want to go back
to the other universe?

59
00:06:06.608 --> 00:06:09.177
Shut it down!
Shut it down. you hear me!

60
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.113
- Come back!
- OK! OK! OK!

61
00:06:11.146 --> 00:06:12.948
I... I'm back!

62
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.752
Listen. you're only using

63
00:06:16.785 --> 00:06:18.787
the other worlds to acquire
special skills.

64
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.022
Do you understand?

65
00:06:20.055 --> 00:06:21.332
If you fall
for their temptations.

66
00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:23.625
you invite contradiction. chaos.

67
00:06:23.658 --> 00:06:27.863
The Clay pot could shatter
and you could die. or far worse.

68
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.400
What can be worse than death?

69
00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:34.903
We should keep moving
until reinforcements come.

70
00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:36.338
No. no. no!

71
00:06:36.371 --> 00:06:40.809
Enough of your Clay pots.
cream cheese. no cows.

72
00:06:40.842 --> 00:06:43.679
Explain it all to me now.

73
00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:49.852
You're right.

74
00:06:51.252 --> 00:06:52.754
In the Alphaverse.

75
00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:56.124
we began training many
young minds to Verse Jump.

76
00:06:56.157 --> 00:06:59.294
But there was one who was far
and above the most gifted.

77
00:06:59.327 --> 00:07:01.396
Our little explorer.

78
00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:03.465
You saw her potential...

79
00:07:03.498 --> 00:07:05.734
so you pushed her

80
00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:07.469
beyond her limit.

81
00:07:07.502 --> 00:07:10.305
Warning. Unstable.

82
00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:13.508
Though the
overloaded mind usually dies.

83
00:07:13.541 --> 00:07:16.311
instead her mind was fractured.

84
00:07:17.245 --> 00:07:18.914
Warning. Unstable.

85
00:07:18.947 --> 00:07:21.016
- Mind fracturing.

86
00:07:24.018 --> 00:07:28.190
Now her mind
experiences every world.

87
00:07:28.223 --> 00:07:29.558
every possibility.

88
00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:31.626
at the same exact time.

89
00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:32.994
commanding
the infinite knowledge

90
00:07:33.027 --> 00:07:35.097
and power of the multiverse.

91
00:07:36.097 --> 00:07:37.432
Now she's seen too much.

92
00:07:37.465 --> 00:07:39.201
lost any sense of morality.

93
00:07:39.234 --> 00:07:41.303
any belief in objective truth.

94
00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:43.572
What does she want?

95
00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:45.907
No-one knows.

96
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.309
All we know

97
00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:49.778
is she's looking for you.

98
00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:57.486
Hey. you said
I was the wrong one.

99
00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.956
What you did back there.
it changed my mind.

100
00:08:01.956 --> 00:08:04.493
You were incredible.

101
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.163
Waymond.

102
00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.422
Of course.

103
00:09:25.673 --> 00:09:27.275
Evelyn! Come back!

104
00:09:27.308 --> 00:09:28.719
Evelyn! Jump
to another combat universe!

105
00:09:28.743 --> 00:09:29.878
- Huh?
- Try peeing yourself!

106
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:31.471
- Pee?
- It's always a good jumping pad!

107
00:09:35.216 --> 00:09:38.019
Come on. wake up! Wake up!

108
00:09:38.052 --> 00:09:39.287
What did you do to me?

109
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.656
Did you staple something
to my forehead?

110
00:09:41.689 --> 00:09:43.467
No! I didn't do anything.
You did it yourself!

111
00:09:43.491 --> 00:09:45.860
- Did we call for backup?
- I did not do it to myself!

112
00:09:45.893 --> 00:09:47.762
- Did you call?
- It has blood on it!

113
00:09:47.795 --> 00:09:51.433
We've detained the assailants.
No backup was requested.

114
00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.301
You guys are wasting
a trip up. Copy?

115
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.073
Oh. no! She found us.

116
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.508
I said. do you copy?

117
00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:05.914
Clear them.

118
00:10:22.463 --> 00:10:26.101
♪ Rainy day... ♪

119
00:10:26.134 --> 00:10:29.871
♪ Go far away... ♪

120
00:10:29.904 --> 00:10:31.139
Joy?

121
00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.108
Why do you look so stupid?

122
00:10:33.141 --> 00:10:34.710
Ma'am.

123
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.514
You and... your pig
can't be here.

124
00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:42.550
♪ Lonely nights... ♪

125
00:10:45.553 --> 00:10:49.258
Is it that I can't be here...

126
00:10:51.626 --> 00:10:53.495
or that I'm not allowed...

127
00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:55.263
- Huh!
- ..to be here?

128
00:10:55.296 --> 00:10:56.464
Hey!

129
00:10:56.497 --> 00:10:58.166
OK...

130
00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.501
Hands where I can see them.

131
00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:02.904
See. I can physically be here.

132
00:11:04.172 --> 00:11:05.674
But what you meant to say

133
00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:09.477
is you're not
allowing me to be here.

134
00:11:11.179 --> 00:11:12.814
Hands behind your back. Come on.

135
00:11:12.847 --> 00:11:15.317
Waymond!

136
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.819
You're going
to make me walk through you?

137
00:11:17.852 --> 00:11:20.789
Yeah. cute.
I can't let you do that either.

138
00:11:20.822 --> 00:11:23.692
Yeah. again with the 'can't'!

139
00:11:25.326 --> 00:11:26.761
See. I don't think
you understand

140
00:11:26.794 --> 00:11:28.997
the meaning of that word.

141
00:11:39.807 --> 00:11:42.210
- See. I can walk through you.
- Officer down!

142
00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.379
- No. no! Don't shoot.
- Hands on your head.

143
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.248
Like this?

144
00:12:05.066 --> 00:12:08.002
- Waymond. Wake up! Wake up!
- Daddy!

145
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.373
Oh. no!

146
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.380
Oh. shit.

147
00:12:21.682 --> 00:12:23.218
- Ugh!
- Oh!

148
00:12:23.251 --> 00:12:25.820
- No!
- Oh. no!

149
00:12:25.853 --> 00:12:28.690
Don't worry. Evelyn.

150
00:12:28.723 --> 00:12:30.825
- No. no! Oh. God!
- It's...

151
00:12:30.858 --> 00:12:33.561
Mmm! Organic.

152
00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:39.868
Arggh...!

153
00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:50.211
Oh. my God.

154
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.249
You...

155
00:12:59.587 --> 00:13:02.991
You're Juju Toobootie.

156
00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:08.997
The "Great Evil" Waymond
was talking about is...

157
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.066
in my Joy?

158
00:13:14.769 --> 00:13:16.337
Don't engage.

159
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.906
She can't be reasoned with.

160
00:13:26.013 --> 00:13:27.349
Oh...

161
00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:29.551
It's you.

162
00:13:29.584 --> 00:13:31.786
You're the reason my daughter

163
00:13:31.819 --> 00:13:33.721
doesn't call anymore.

164
00:13:33.754 --> 00:13:35.690
why she dropped out of college

165
00:13:35.723 --> 00:13:37.425
and gets tattoos.

166
00:13:37.458 --> 00:13:39.060
Aww!

167
00:13:39.093 --> 00:13:41.463
You...

168
00:13:41.496 --> 00:13:44.332
are why she thinks she is gay.

169
00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.034
Ah!

170
00:13:46.067 --> 00:13:48.069
I'm so sorry.

171
00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:50.905
You're still hung up on the fact

172
00:13:50.938 --> 00:13:53.108
that I like girls in this world?

173
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:57.278
The universe...

174
00:13:59.847 --> 00:14:02.550
is so much bigger
than you realise.

175
00:14:02.583 --> 00:14:05.386
Huh?

176
00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:07.088
OK!

177
00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:10.091
No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no!

178
00:14:10.124 --> 00:14:11.124
Stop!

179
00:14:15.129 --> 00:14:17.298
- Huh!
- Don't make me fight you.

180
00:14:17.331 --> 00:14:19.601
I am really good.

181
00:14:19.634 --> 00:14:21.102
I don't believe you.

182
00:14:21.135 --> 00:14:22.804
OK. OK.

183
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.719
Nice.

184
00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:39.787
You peed yourself.

185
00:14:41.722 --> 00:14:43.391
No. Evelyn.
you're not locked in!

186
00:14:47.228 --> 00:14:48.930
Oh!

187
00:14:51.966 --> 00:14:53.201
Hmm.

188
00:14:54.969 --> 00:14:56.337
Where did she jump?

189
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.473
Um. she's off the damn map.

190
00:15:01.409 --> 00:15:04.212
♪ Flap your hands

191
00:15:04.245 --> 00:15:05.346
♪ My hands... ♪

192
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.515
She appears to be in a universe

193
00:15:07.548 --> 00:15:09.150
where everyone has...

194
00:15:09.183 --> 00:15:11.719
hot dogs instead of fingers.

195
00:15:11.752 --> 00:15:13.154
I mean. it just doesn't matter

196
00:15:13.187 --> 00:15:16.824
how many times I see it.
I'm so moved.

197
00:15:16.857 --> 00:15:19.727
Oh. you stop it!

198
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.995
An evolutionary branch

199
00:15:21.028 --> 00:15:22.998
in the anatomy
of the human race?

200
00:15:36.377 --> 00:15:37.979
A jump like that

201
00:15:38.012 --> 00:15:39.514
would've fried most people.

202
00:15:39.547 --> 00:15:41.082
Like I said...

203
00:15:41.849 --> 00:15:43.184
she's not most people.

204
00:15:43.217 --> 00:15:45.486
Don't... Why are you
treating me like this?

205
00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:46.988
One minute. you're so warm.

206
00:15:47.021 --> 00:15:49.591
then one minute.
you're cold and awful.

207
00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:54.028
This is crazy!

208
00:15:54.061 --> 00:15:56.097
You're starting to get it.

209
00:15:57.365 --> 00:15:59.100
Where are you gonna go?

210
00:16:06.107 --> 00:16:07.275
Ugh!

211
00:16:07.308 --> 00:16:09.444
You know. of all
the Evelyns I've seen...

212
00:16:10.945 --> 00:16:13.581
you're definitely one of
the more interesting ones.

213
00:16:15.716 --> 00:16:18.286
What do you want from me?

214
00:16:24.492 --> 00:16:25.927
Here.

215
00:16:31.165 --> 00:16:34.102
Let me help you
open up your mind. huh?

216
00:16:35.236 --> 00:16:36.871
Hmm?

217
00:16:37.772 --> 00:16:39.641
- Oh!
- Here.

218
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.880
Open up.

219
00:16:47.415 --> 00:16:49.050
It's OK.

220
00:16:51.786 --> 00:16:53.555
It's OK.

221
00:16:54.588 --> 00:16:55.690
Take a peek.

222
00:17:11.372 --> 00:17:13.541
Oh. shit.

223
00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.176
What is that?

224
00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:16.878
I got bored one day

225
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:20.115
and I put everything on a bagel.

226
00:17:22.616 --> 00:17:24.485
Everything.

227
00:17:24.518 --> 00:17:28.790
All my hopes and dreams.
my old report cards.

228
00:17:28.823 --> 00:17:30.124
every breed of dog.

229
00:17:30.157 --> 00:17:32.961
every last personal ad
on craigslist.

230
00:17:34.495 --> 00:17:35.730
Sesame.

231
00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.465
Poppy seed.

232
00:17:38.532 --> 00:17:40.068
Salt.

233
00:17:41.068 --> 00:17:43.337
And it collapsed in on itself.

234
00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:46.941
'Cause. you see.
when you really put

235
00:17:46.974 --> 00:17:49.677
everything on a bagel.

236
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.746
it becomes this.

237
00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:53.748
Come on. Run. Evelyn.

238
00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:55.984
The truth.

239
00:17:57.284 --> 00:18:00.689
What is the truth?

240
00:18:02.656 --> 00:18:04.292
Nothing...

241
00:18:05.659 --> 00:18:07.362
matters.

242
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.299
No. Joy.

243
00:18:12.066 --> 00:18:14.436
You don't believe that.

244
00:18:15.202 --> 00:18:17.605
Feels nice. doesn't it?

245
00:18:19.106 --> 00:18:21.109
If nothing matters...

246
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:24.345
then all the pain
and guilt you feel

247
00:18:24.378 --> 00:18:27.082
for making nothing
of your life...

248
00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:30.351
it goes away.

- Ah Ba?

254
00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.384
I'm not your father.

255
00:19:03.417 --> 00:19:05.753
At least not the one you know.

256
00:19:05.786 --> 00:19:07.789
I am Alpha Gong Gong.

257
00:19:07.822 --> 00:19:09.757
- Huh!
- Not you too!

258
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.996
Sir. what are you doing here?

259
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:17.398
We need to go. Just follow me.

260
00:19:33.013 --> 00:19:34.382
Sir. I have this under control.

261
00:19:34.415 --> 00:19:37.285
Again.
you deliberately disobey me

262
00:19:37.318 --> 00:19:41.022
and cause another mind
to be compromised.

263
00:19:44.158 --> 00:19:47.995
And now you know
what we must do.

264
00:19:48.028 --> 00:19:50.364
No! Please.

265
00:19:50.397 --> 00:19:52.333
She's unlike anything
we've seen.

266
00:19:52.366 --> 00:19:55.102
She could finally stop
Jobu Tupaki.

267
00:19:55.135 --> 00:19:57.705
You mean the monster
that is inside my daughter?

268
00:19:57.738 --> 00:20:00.308
Well. why didn't you tell me
about it earlier?

269
00:20:00.341 --> 00:20:02.910
What else are you Alpha people
not telling me?

270
00:20:02.943 --> 00:20:05.213
Did you see her
dance that man to death?

271
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:09.684
There is no way I am
the Evelyn you are looking for.

272
00:20:09.717 --> 00:20:12.053
No. I see it so clearly.

273
00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:14.155
See what?

274
00:20:15.656 --> 00:20:18.292
I'm no good at anything.

275
00:20:18.325 --> 00:20:19.527
Exactly.

276
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.996
I've seen thousands of Evelyns.

277
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:24.398
but never an Evelyn like you.

278
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:27.268
You have so many goals
you never finished.

279
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:29.971
dreams you never followed.

280
00:20:30.004 --> 00:20:32.674
You're living your worst you.

281
00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:37.912
I cannot be the worst.
What about that hot dog one?

282
00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:40.214
No. Can't you see?

283
00:20:40.247 --> 00:20:43.084
Every failure here
branched off into a success

284
00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:45.052
for another Evelyn
in another life.

285
00:20:45.085 --> 00:20:48.189
Most people only
have a few significant

286
00:20:48.222 --> 00:20:50.591
alternate life paths
so close to them.

287
00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:52.927
But you. here.

288
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.897
you're capable of anything

289
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.167
because you're so bad
at everything.

290
00:21:03.504 --> 00:21:05.406
What good is all that power
when her mind

291
00:21:05.439 --> 00:21:09.176
is already succumbing
to that chaos. huh?

292
00:21:09.209 --> 00:21:11.879
Hello?

293
00:21:11.912 --> 00:21:13.714
Hello? Mom. Dad?
What's going on?

294
00:21:13.747 --> 00:21:16.317
No. Do not answer her.

295
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.653
It's one of her tricks.

296
00:21:18.686 --> 00:21:21.923
Sir. our readings indicate
it's not Jobu Tupaki.

297
00:21:22.923 --> 00:21:24.292
But if she's not here...

298
00:21:27.895 --> 00:21:29.063
Oh. shit!

299
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:35.636
Do not engage! Run! Run!

300
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:38.439
Watch these two here
while I deal with Jobu.

301
00:21:38.472 --> 00:21:42.576
I'm not risking the safety
of the Alphaverse for this.

302
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.416
Get us as far away
from Joy as you can.

303
00:21:48.449 --> 00:21:49.984
- Why?
- I'll be back. I promise.

304
00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:52.153
No. no. no. wait.
Why don't you...

305
00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:53.254
Huh?

306
00:21:53.287 --> 00:21:54.922
- Hello?
- Joy?

307
00:21:54.955 --> 00:21:56.199
- No. no... That's not...
- Joy's here!

308
00:21:56.223 --> 00:21:57.634
- No. no. no. that's not Joy.
- Hello?

309
00:21:57.658 --> 00:22:01.262
- Joy? Joy. I'm coming.
- Let me in.

310
00:22:01.295 --> 00:22:04.499
OK. be patient! This is heavy.

311
00:22:05.532 --> 00:22:08.202
- Joy. why are you here?
- I have no fucking clue!

312
00:22:08.235 --> 00:22:10.338
- Hey. gentle language!
- Just what is going on?

313
00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:12.907
I'm sure there's a very good
explanation for all of this...

314
00:22:14.308 --> 00:22:16.811
What the fuck. Mom?!

315
00:22:17.945 --> 00:22:19.914
What the fuck are you doing?

316
00:22:27.755 --> 00:22:30.425
But... she's too powerful.

317
00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:34.295
Are we all having a stroke?

318
00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.374
You are like puppets.
You know? Puppets?

319
00:22:46.407 --> 00:22:49.110
You can do things
you normally cannot do.

320
00:22:49.143 --> 00:22:51.212
It's like that movie.

321
00:22:51.245 --> 00:22:53.514
Um. you... you... That movie...

322
00:22:53.547 --> 00:22:55.016
OK. what are you talking about?

323
00:22:55.049 --> 00:22:56.717
- A movie?
- 'Raccaccoonie'!

324
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.885
- What?
- Huh?

325
00:22:57.918 --> 00:22:58.853
'Raccaccoonie'. you know?

326
00:22:58.886 --> 00:23:00.921
The one with the chef...

327
00:23:00.954 --> 00:23:02.590
And he makes bad food. Phooey.

328
00:23:02.623 --> 00:23:04.692
And then this raccoon
sit on his head.

329
00:23:04.725 --> 00:23:08.829
ooh. control him.
and then he cooks good food.

330
00:23:08.862 --> 00:23:11.032
Do you mean 'Ratatouille'?

331
00:23:11.065 --> 00:23:12.600
'Ratatouille'?
I like that movie.

332
00:23:12.633 --> 00:23:15.002
No. No. no. no. no. no.
'Raccaccoonie'!

333
00:23:15.035 --> 00:23:16.170
With the raccoon.

334
00:23:16.203 --> 00:23:17.738
- OK...
- Raccoon?

335
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:19.507
Everybody.
stop making up sounds!

336
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.676
So there's a raccoon Joy.
and there's a raccoon me?

337
00:23:22.709 --> 00:23:24.412
And they are controlling us?

338
00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:26.280
Yeah. from the other universes.

339
00:23:28.215 --> 00:23:30.084
- Oh. OK.
- That's very funny. Evelyn.

340
00:23:30.117 --> 00:23:33.821
OK. it sounds a little bit
ridiculous. but it's true.

341
00:23:33.854 --> 00:23:35.356
I swear to God. you...

342
00:23:35.389 --> 00:23:36.757
You are macho man.

343
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.526
- I like that!
- Oh. yeah.

344
00:23:41.061 --> 00:23:42.329
Hey. honey. don't worry.

345
00:23:42.362 --> 00:23:44.131
- Daddy will get you out of this.
- Ah Ba?

346
00:23:44.164 --> 00:23:47.468
Quickly.
while she is distracted.

347
00:23:48.268 --> 00:23:50.371
- No.
- It's only protocol.

348
00:23:50.404 --> 00:23:53.307
It gives her one
less universe to access.

349
00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.608
God...

350
00:23:54.641 --> 00:23:56.444
- Can you...
- Oh. it's Becky.

351
00:23:56.477 --> 00:23:57.945
Hi. Becky. Hold on.

352
00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:00.181
How do you expect to defeat
her in every universe

353
00:24:00.214 --> 00:24:01.916
if you can't even
kill her in one?

354
00:24:01.949 --> 00:24:03.317
Hey. babe.

355
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.319
She's your granddaughter.

356
00:24:06.086 --> 00:24:09.256
How do you think I feel?

357
00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:11.225
But this is a sacrifice

358
00:24:11.258 --> 00:24:13.861
that is necessary
to win the war.

359
00:24:13.894 --> 00:24:16.497
OK. there we go.

360
00:24:20.801 --> 00:24:22.537
You must do it.

361
00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.406
Go.

362
00:24:28.208 --> 00:24:29.510
Go.

363
00:24:29.543 --> 00:24:31.645
Yeah. my mom
taped me to a chair.

364
00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:33.814
Uh. because of raccoons.

365
00:24:33.847 --> 00:24:35.916
- OK. be patient.
- Yeah. it's a long story.

366
00:24:35.949 --> 00:24:37.985
- Daddy's trying to...
- It's been a day.

367
00:24:45.626 --> 00:24:46.694
Mom?

368
00:24:46.727 --> 00:24:48.362
I don't like this at all.

369
00:24:57.905 --> 00:24:59.607
What are you...

370
00:25:02.009 --> 00:25:03.778
what are you doing?

371
00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:09.183
Hey! I almost had it.

372
00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:10.684
Oh. come on!

373
00:25:10.717 --> 00:25:12.119
You are already under her spell.

374
00:25:12.152 --> 00:25:14.321
Holy shit!
Holy shit. he has a gun!

375
00:25:14.354 --> 00:25:15.589
Everyone. stay calm!

376
00:25:15.622 --> 00:25:17.233
I think it's time
for a family discussion!

377
00:25:17.257 --> 00:25:19.326
It's OK. it's OK. it's OK.

378
00:25:22.663 --> 00:25:25.032
I won't let you kill her.

379
00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:28.769
Don't you see what
is happening to your mind?

380
00:25:30.003 --> 00:25:31.739
In my universe.

381
00:25:31.772 --> 00:25:36.043
you pushed your own daughter
too hard until you broke her.

382
00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:38.946
You...

383
00:25:38.979 --> 00:25:41.849
you created Jobu Tupaki.

384
00:25:41.882 --> 00:25:43.951
When did he get
so good at English?

385
00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:47.154
Now I must stop you.

386
00:25:47.187 --> 00:25:49.290
Otherwise. it's only
a matter of time

387
00:25:49.323 --> 00:25:53.728
before you become just like her.

388
00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:59.533
Just like her?

389
00:26:05.639 --> 00:26:08.709
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you doing?

390
00:26:08.742 --> 00:26:11.579
Evelyn. I don't think now
is a good time to dance!

391
00:26:15.215 --> 00:26:16.550
Baba.

392
00:26:16.583 --> 00:26:18.285
I know you don't agree with me.

393
00:26:18.318 --> 00:26:19.853
but this is something
I have to do.

394
00:26:19.886 --> 00:26:21.555
- What the...
- That sounds weird.

395
00:26:21.588 --> 00:26:23.357
No. no. no...

396
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.292
- OK.
- Wait!

397
00:26:25.325 --> 00:26:26.605
You don't know
where you'll jump.

398
00:26:29.263 --> 00:26:31.199
Enough!

399
00:26:32.232 --> 00:26:34.001
Warning. Unstable.

400
00:26:46.079 --> 00:26:47.548
Please.

401
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:50.584
I cannot lose another
loved one to the darkness.

402
00:26:50.617 --> 00:26:54.755
- Warning. Unstable.
- Don't worry. You won't.

403
00:27:07.034 --> 00:27:10.271
Hey. uh. clean up
in there. alright?

404
00:27:10.304 --> 00:27:12.006
Here. Oh!

405
00:27:14.608 --> 00:27:16.043
Where did she jump?!

406
00:27:16.076 --> 00:27:17.745
Sorry. Ah Ba.

407
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.049
- Whoa!
- OK!

408
00:27:22.082 --> 00:27:23.660
- Come on. come on. come on!
- Jesus. Mom!

409
00:27:23.684 --> 00:27:24.918
- That way!
- Oh. no!

410
00:27:24.951 --> 00:27:26.720
- Oh. my God!
- Come on. come on!

411
00:27:26.753 --> 00:27:28.122
- Oh!
- No!

412
00:27:28.922 --> 00:27:30.791
Warning. mind fracturing.

413
00:27:30.824 --> 00:27:34.428
Send every Jumper with
a counterpart in the area.

414
00:27:34.461 --> 00:27:36.664
Now!

415
00:27:37.431 --> 00:27:40.267
Once again.
the Alphaverse finds itself

416
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.772
as the last line of defence
against total chaos.

417
00:27:44.805 --> 00:27:48.909
Be brave. This Evelyn
is as stubborn as the others.

418
00:27:48.942 --> 00:27:51.111
She has given us no choice.

419
00:27:51.144 --> 00:27:55.683
We must kill her before she
becomes another Jobu Tupaki.

420
00:27:57.517 --> 00:27:59.920
- Joy.
- Oh. what?

421
00:27:59.953 --> 00:28:01.789
Joy... Joy...

422
00:28:02.689 --> 00:28:06.860
I know you have these feelings.

423
00:28:06.893 --> 00:28:10.731
feelings that make you so sad.

424
00:28:11.531 --> 00:28:15.903
That makes you just...
just want to give up.

425
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.106
It's not your fault.

426
00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:21.609
Not your fault.

427
00:28:22.376 --> 00:28:24.278
I know.

428
00:28:25.345 --> 00:28:27.481
It's... it's her.

429
00:28:27.514 --> 00:28:30.317
Juju Chewbacca.

430
00:28:32.419 --> 00:28:35.789
She has your soul...

431
00:28:35.822 --> 00:28:37.591
in the palm of her hand.

432
00:28:37.624 --> 00:28:38.926
What are you talking about?

433
00:28:38.959 --> 00:28:43.097
The only way I can
defeat her to save you...

434
00:28:44.164 --> 00:28:46.667
is to become like her.

435
00:28:50.737 --> 00:28:52.039
Evelyn!

436
00:28:52.072 --> 00:28:54.441
Your daughter is beyond saving.

437
00:28:54.474 --> 00:28:56.610
And soon you will be too.

438
00:29:00.714 --> 00:29:02.449
Your time is up.

439
00:29:02.482 --> 00:29:04.852
Find your jumping pads.

440
00:29:06.186 --> 00:29:10.958
♪ Ave Maria... ♪

441
00:29:14.194 --> 00:29:16.864
♪ Ave Maria... ♪

442
00:29:24.504 --> 00:29:26.774
Mom? Mom?

443
00:29:26.807 --> 00:29:29.377
I think
you're pushing things too far.

444
00:29:31.478 --> 00:29:32.946
Or not far enough.

445
00:29:34.714 --> 00:29:36.884
Oh. my God! Oh. my God!

446
00:29:39.619 --> 00:29:41.155
Evelyn?

447
00:29:41.188 --> 00:29:42.856
- Ugh!
- Oh. my God.

448
00:29:45.625 --> 00:29:46.894
Oh!

449
00:29:46.927 --> 00:29:48.662
What are you doing?!

450
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.459
Mom!

451
00:31:48.248 --> 00:31:49.316
Arggh!

452
00:31:54.387 --> 00:31:55.823
Ohh!

453
00:32:10.737 --> 00:32:13.574
Holy... shit.

454
00:32:13.607 --> 00:32:15.175
Is he dead?

455
00:32:17.877 --> 00:32:19.980
See. not dead. Go!

456
00:32:20.013 --> 00:32:22.213
- That's definitely not...
- Hurry up. please. Go quick!

457
00:32:22.782 --> 00:32:24.785
OK. come on. guys.

458
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.555
Dad. go!

459
00:32:35.595 --> 00:32:37.064
Oh. my God.

460
00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:43.237
Does my baby
want to go for a walk?

461
00:32:51.978 --> 00:32:53.680
Yow!

462
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:57.985
No!

463
00:32:58.018 --> 00:33:00.487
Oh. Johnny! Oh!

464
00:33:03.023 --> 00:33:04.157
Orange soda?

465
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.993
- Huh?
- What is she doing?

466
00:33:06.026 --> 00:33:07.794
I think when
she does something weird

467
00:33:07.827 --> 00:33:09.596
it helps her fight.
it gives her power.

468
00:33:12.666 --> 00:33:14.001
Sorry. baby.

469
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.510
Ask her for another one.

470
00:33:31.151 --> 00:33:32.919
No! Johnny!

471
00:33:37.891 --> 00:33:39.360
Fried egg?

472
00:33:40.493 --> 00:33:43.664
You... bitch.

473
00:33:46.866 --> 00:33:48.435
Go!

474
00:33:49.836 --> 00:33:52.172
Huh?

475
00:33:52.205 --> 00:33:53.941
Oh...

476
00:33:54.708 --> 00:33:56.076
Evelyn. if you don't step up.

477
00:33:56.109 --> 00:33:57.978
I'm giving some
of your shifts to Chad.

478
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.749
Yeah!

479
00:34:02.782 --> 00:34:04.551
- Oh. my God!
- Oh. good one!

480
00:34:04.584 --> 00:34:05.852
I got a picture!

481
00:34:18.665 --> 00:34:20.434
Go.

482
00:35:03.843 --> 00:35:05.312
Stop...

483
00:35:05.345 --> 00:35:07.013
- Huh? What happened?
- You stop!

484
00:35:07.046 --> 00:35:08.181
I think they lost their...

485
00:35:08.214 --> 00:35:09.983
- Stop it!
- ..powers?

486
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:12.385
Sir?

487
00:35:12.418 --> 00:35:14.488
I am gonna need
another jumping pad.

488
00:35:14.521 --> 00:35:16.690
Received information. Over.

489
00:35:23.296 --> 00:35:25.074
I think she needs to do
something weird again.

490
00:35:25.098 --> 00:35:26.633
What's he doing?

491
00:35:37.443 --> 00:35:39.913
Oh. my God. He's trying
to stick it in his butt.

492
00:35:39.946 --> 00:35:41.715
No!

493
00:35:42.816 --> 00:35:44.251
- No. no. no!
- Ah... No!

494
00:35:46.186 --> 00:35:48.088
Ah. Evelyn. do jumping Jacks!

495
00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:49.489
That's not weird at all.

496
00:35:49.522 --> 00:35:50.924
Um... Slap him!

497
00:35:50.957 --> 00:35:52.626
No. no. no. no!

498
00:35:52.659 --> 00:35:54.728
Mom. just blow on his nose!

499
00:35:54.761 --> 00:35:56.029
What?

500
00:35:56.062 --> 00:35:57.631
It'll make him involuntarily

501
00:35:57.664 --> 00:35:59.299
scream and do weird noises.

502
00:35:59.332 --> 00:36:01.768
Trust her. Evelyn!
It's really weird.

503
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.189
Wow. Mom is really good.

504
00:36:56.222 --> 00:36:58.392
Huh!

505
00:36:59.893 --> 00:37:01.428
Sorry.

506
00:37:21.047 --> 00:37:22.449
Oh!

507
00:37:24.584 --> 00:37:26.186
Arggh!

508
00:37:34.093 --> 00:37:35.762
Ahh!

509
00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:58.218
Reaching mental capacity.

510
00:38:00.086 --> 00:38:01.721
Reaching mental capacity.

511
00:38:03.957 --> 00:38:04.957
Holy shit!

512
00:38:06.225 --> 00:38:09.229
- Ow!
- I'm sorry. Evelyn.

513
00:38:09.262 --> 00:38:11.398
- Mind fracturing.
- We'll die together.

514
00:38:31.084 --> 00:38:33.186
Pinky... Arggh!

515
00:38:35.588 --> 00:38:37.591
- Get her. I see her.
- Let's go!

516
00:39:12.992 --> 00:39:14.260
Evelyn!

517
00:39:14.293 --> 00:39:16.196
Evelyn. Evelyn!

518
00:39:16.229 --> 00:39:17.364
Whoa. whoa!

519
00:39:22.001 --> 00:39:24.237
No need to explain.

520
00:39:26.139 --> 00:39:28.008
I have been watching you.

521
00:39:28.041 --> 00:39:30.677
You're back!

522
00:39:31.577 --> 00:39:33.580
Did you see how good I am?

523
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.182
I'm gonna do it.

524
00:39:36.215 --> 00:39:39.919
I am going to defeat
that Jobu Tupaki.

525
00:39:39.952 --> 00:39:42.689
Hey. You got her name right.

526
00:39:44.257 --> 00:39:48.862
Evelyn. what you're doing
is crazy. reckless.

527
00:39:48.895 --> 00:39:52.365
Your stupid plan to somehow
save your daughter

528
00:39:52.398 --> 00:39:56.303
has managed to piss off
everyone in the multiverse.

529
00:39:57.503 --> 00:39:59.539
But it just might work.

530
00:40:03.176 --> 00:40:04.477
What? What?

531
00:40:17.657 --> 00:40:19.893
I only wish I could be there

532
00:40:19.926 --> 00:40:21.127
to see you finish this.

533
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.096
What do you mean.
you don't see me finish?

534
00:40:23.129 --> 00:40:25.198
I'm grateful

535
00:40:25.231 --> 00:40:26.866
that chance was kind enough

536
00:40:26.899 --> 00:40:29.803
to let us have these
last few moments together.

537
00:40:45.818 --> 00:40:47.354
Alpha Waymond?

538
00:40:48.121 --> 00:40:49.956
Alpha Waymond?

539
00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:52.158
What happened?

540
00:40:52.191 --> 00:40:54.528
Was I Raccoon Waymond again?

541
00:40:57.597 --> 00:40:59.432
Raccoon Waymond is dead.

542
00:41:03.102 --> 00:41:04.905
Is that Raccoon Joy?

543
00:41:05.905 --> 00:41:07.374
Am I getting it?

544
00:41:09.542 --> 00:41:11.478
I can to stop you. Jobu...

545
00:41:11.511 --> 00:41:14.781
now that I am reaching
my full potential.

546
00:41:14.814 --> 00:41:17.317
Oh. you still can't see
what's happening.

547
00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:19.419
No. I see clearly.

548
00:41:19.452 --> 00:41:22.956
More clearly than ever before.

549
00:41:38.137 --> 00:41:40.440
Oh. my God! Evelyn.

550
00:41:41.741 --> 00:41:43.009
Oh. my God!

551
00:41:44.911 --> 00:41:47.714

Hi. Mrs Wang.

594
00:45:39.412 --> 00:45:41.013
Hey. Mom.
So. about this morning...

595
00:45:41.046 --> 00:45:42.782
- Enough with your tricks.
- What?

596
00:45:42.815 --> 00:45:44.092
- I know you're in there.
- Whoa.

597
00:45:44.116 --> 00:45:45.618
- Get out of my daughter.
- OK!

598
00:45:45.651 --> 00:45:47.253
Mom. are you already drunk?

599
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.393
- Hey. Becky.
- Mmm-hmm?

600
00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.297
Can you go help my dad
with the party?

601
00:45:59.165 --> 00:46:00.666
Now?

602
00:46:00.699 --> 00:46:02.769
- Yeah.
- Go. Becky.

603
00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:04.570
Go. Go.

604
00:46:07.139 --> 00:46:08.808
Thanks. babe.

605
00:46:12.778 --> 00:46:14.914
You see it all. don't you?

606
00:46:19.585 --> 00:46:22.555
You can see

607
00:46:22.588 --> 00:46:24.424
how everything...

608
00:46:25.558 --> 00:46:27.794
is just a random rearrangement

609
00:46:27.827 --> 00:46:32.198
of particles
in a vibrating superposition.

610
00:46:37.703 --> 00:46:40.106
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

611
00:46:40.139 --> 00:46:42.308
But I can do this.

612
00:46:43.742 --> 00:46:45.211
Huh?

613
00:46:45.244 --> 00:46:47.613
But you see...

614
00:46:47.646 --> 00:46:49.816
how everything we do...

615
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:51.651
Huh?

616
00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:55.955

00:47:02.394 --> 00:47:03.997
You're everywhere.

619
00:47:06.265 --> 00:47:07.834
You're like me.

620
00:47:08.601 --> 00:47:09.936
That's right.

621
00:47:09.969 --> 00:47:12.605
I'm the one you're looking for.

622
00:47:12.638 --> 00:47:15.141
I'm the one
who's going to defeat you.

623
00:47:15.174 --> 00:47:17.043
OK.

624
00:47:19.044 --> 00:47:20.780
Hit me.

625
00:47:22.581 --> 00:47:24.184
Punch my face.

626
00:47:32.825 --> 00:47:34.393
Oh...

627
00:47:34.426 --> 00:47:36.462
Oh! Ow! Ow!

628
00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:39.232

Yeah.

00:48:30.516 --> 00:48:32.218
Sit down.

648
00:48:32.985 --> 00:48:34.754
Sit down. grab a snack.

649
00:48:34.787 --> 00:48:36.622
make yourself comfortable. huh?

650
00:48:36.655 --> 00:48:39.125
- Oh. hey. you OK?
- OK.

651
00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:43.563
Mmm. We can speed this up.

652
00:48:43.596 --> 00:48:46.899
Sit on the crack.

653
00:48:46.932 --> 00:48:49.201
Sit on the crack

654
00:48:49.234 --> 00:48:50.436
Get comfortable.

655
00:49:01.714 --> 00:49:03.382
Bagel.

656
00:49:06.719 --> 00:49:09.155
Please. I don't care
about the bagel.

657
00:49:09.188 --> 00:49:11.057
I don't care
about the Alphaverse.

658
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:12.892
I only care about my Joy.

659
00:49:12.925 --> 00:49:14.160
Give me back my daughter

660
00:49:14.193 --> 00:49:15.828
and I'll leave you
alone forever.

661
00:49:15.861 --> 00:49:18.331
Sorry! No can do.

662
00:49:18.364 --> 00:49:19.465
Why not?

663
00:49:19.498 --> 00:49:22.168
I am your daughter.
Your daughter is me.

664
00:49:22.201 --> 00:49:26.939
Every version of Joy
is Jobu Tupaki.

665
00:49:26.972 --> 00:49:29.542
- You can't separate us.
- No.

666
00:49:29.575 --> 00:49:34.213
I have felt everything
your daughter has felt.

667
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:41.554
And I know the joy...

668
00:49:42.955 --> 00:49:45.959
and the pain of having you
as my mother.

669
00:49:47.726 --> 00:49:50.262
Then you know I would do...

670
00:49:50.295 --> 00:49:54.434
Only do the right thing
for her. for you.

671
00:49:55.434 --> 00:49:59.472
'Right' is a tiny box invented
by people who are afraid

672
00:49:59.505 --> 00:50:03.476
and I know what it feels like
to be trapped inside that box.

673
00:50:06.445 --> 00:50:08.014
Mom...

674
00:50:08.047 --> 00:50:09.949
No. it's not like that.

675
00:50:09.982 --> 00:50:11.584
It's Gong Gong.

676
00:50:11.617 --> 00:50:12.918
He's a different generation.

677
00:50:12.951 --> 00:50:15.388
You don't have to hide
behind him anymore.

678
00:50:15.421 --> 00:50:17.123
You should feel relieved.

679
00:50:17.156 --> 00:50:20.526
The bagel will show you
the true nature of things.

680
00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:23.863
You'll be free from that box.
just like me.

681
00:50:23.896 --> 00:50:26.198
No. no. I'm not like you.

682
00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:29.568
You're young and your mind
is always changing.

683
00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:31.771
I still know who I am.

684
00:50:31.804 --> 00:50:34.006
You have no idea
what you've done.

685
00:50:34.039 --> 00:50:36.643
You're stuck like this forever.

686
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:41.047
No. I'm going back with my Joy.

687
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.350
to my family. to live my life.

688
00:50:44.383 --> 00:50:45.785

689
00:50:45.818 --> 00:50:47.787
OK.

690
00:50:49.822 --> 00:50:51.991
Good luck with that.

691
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:06.338
Thank you so much for coming.

692
00:51:11.343 --> 00:51:13.579
Thank you. Thank your father.

693
00:51:27.025 --> 00:51:29.128
All this time...

694
00:51:30.596 --> 00:51:34.100
I wasn't looking for you
so I could kill you.

695
00:51:36.535 --> 00:51:40.973
I was just looking for someone
who could see what I see.

696
00:51:43.008 --> 00:51:46.446
Feel what I feel.

697
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.803
And that someone...

698
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.776
is you.

699
00:52:18.577 --> 00:52:20.446
Evelyn!

700
00:52:20.479 --> 00:52:23.316
- You're alive!
- Impossible.

701
00:52:27.386 --> 00:52:29.121
- Hello?
- Mrs Wang?

702
00:52:29.154 --> 00:52:30.556
Where... where are you?

703
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:34.393
I mean. to not even show up
for your appointment?!

704
00:52:34.426 --> 00:52:35.661
Shut up.

705
00:52:35.694 --> 00:52:36.896
What did you just say?

706
00:52:36.929 --> 00:52:38.798
I said shut up.

707
00:52:38.831 --> 00:52:40.299
You don't matter.

708
00:52:40.332 --> 00:52:42.368
Whatever I did. I'm sorry.

709
00:52:42.401 --> 00:52:43.669
Nothing matters.

710
00:52:43.702 --> 00:52:45.538
Mrs Wang!

711
00:52:45.571 --> 00:52:48.674
You are gonna
be in serious trouble!

712
00:52:48.707 --> 00:52:50.576
Do you understand?

713
00:52:50.609 --> 00:52:53.012
For you to disrespect...

714
00:53:19.037 --> 00:53:22.541
Happy New Year!

715
00:53:22.574 --> 00:53:24.376
Another year. hmm?

716
00:53:24.409 --> 00:53:26.312
Pretending we know
what we're doing.

717
00:53:26.345 --> 00:53:30.550
but. really. we're just going
around in circles.

718
00:53:31.817 --> 00:53:34.220
Doing laundry and taxes.

719
00:53:34.253 --> 00:53:36.289
and laundry and taxes.

720
00:53:44.263 --> 00:53:45.798
- No more running.
- Excuse me.

721
00:53:45.831 --> 00:53:48.167
Where are the owners? Oh.

722
00:53:48.934 --> 00:53:51.037
There you are. Mr and Mrs Wang.

723
00:53:51.803 --> 00:53:56.442
You have left me no option
but to authorise the seizure

724
00:53:56.475 --> 00:53:59.011
of your personal
and your business assets.

725
00:53:59.044 --> 00:54:00.813
- You have to vacate...
- Wait. Evelyn!

726
00:54:07.619 --> 00:54:09.788
It's just so good. you know?

727
00:54:09.821 --> 00:54:11.657
What are you doing? No! No!

728
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:14.326
My God. Chad. I told
you she couldn't be trusted!

729
00:54:14.359 --> 00:54:16.429
Evelyn. please! Calm down.

730
00:54:17.296 --> 00:54:19.598
Within 48 hours or...

731
00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:29.508
Everything...

732
00:54:32.778 --> 00:54:34.046
Ugh!

733
00:54:39.885 --> 00:54:41.654
What are you doing?

734
00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:50.129
Not a single moment will go by

735
00:54:50.162 --> 00:54:51.997
without every other universe

736
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:54.367
screaming for your attention.

737
00:54:56.768 --> 00:54:58.904
Never fully there.

738
00:54:58.937 --> 00:55:01.507
Just a lifetime of...

739
00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.942
No. no!

740
00:55:02.975 --> 00:55:04.143
Fractured moments.

741
00:55:04.176 --> 00:55:06.045
Raccaccoonie!

742
00:55:06.078 --> 00:55:08.747
Contradictions and confusion...

743
00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.883
- Get off me!
- Chad. don't forget about me.

744
00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:12.351
Here are the papers.

745
00:55:12.384 --> 00:55:16.589
- Oh! Oh. officer?
- OK. OK.

746
00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:25.698
With only a few specks of time

747
00:55:25.731 --> 00:55:28.968
where anything
actually makes any sense.

748
00:55:31.269 --> 00:55:34.540
I've always hated this place.

749
00:55:41.013 --> 00:55:42.548
Raccaccoonie!

750
00:55:42.581 --> 00:55:44.116
Chad!

751
00:55:46.852 --> 00:55:49.722
Get off me! Get off!

752
00:56:01.333 --> 00:56:03.769
Evelyn. why?!

753
00:59:11.489 --> 00:59:14.426
Do you know why
I actually built the bagel?

754
00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:18.697
It wasn't to destroy everything.

755
00:59:19.598 --> 00:59:22.067
It was to destroy myself.

756
00:59:23.068 --> 00:59:27.139
I wanted to see if I went in.
could I finally escape?

757
00:59:29.307 --> 00:59:31.677
Like. actually die.

758
00:59:34.145 --> 00:59:36.182
At least this way...

759
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:39.185
I don't have to do it alone.

760
00:59:45.523 --> 00:59:47.192
You're not listening.

761
00:59:47.225 --> 00:59:49.094
This is out of my league...

762
00:59:49.127 --> 00:59:51.363
Judge Brenner signed...

763
00:59:54.666 --> 00:59:58.070
Well. excuse me!
Excuse me. Mr Wang.

764
00:59:58.103 --> 01:00:00.014
Every person I know
is going through a hard time.

765
01:00:00.038 --> 01:00:02.942
- It's a hard time...
- Evelyn!

766
01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:07.947
Come back.

767
01:00:12.584 --> 01:00:15.120
My silly husband.

768
01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:18.257
Probably making things worse.

769
01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:20.059
Ignore it.

770
01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.566
OK. you can let her go.

771
01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:33.639
You. let her go. It's OK. Yes!

772
01:00:35.407 --> 01:00:37.042
Thank you.

773
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:55.127
How? That's impossible.

774
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.663
It's just
a statistical inevitability.

775
01:00:57.696 --> 01:00:59.765
It's nothing special.

776
01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:10.042
I don't know.

777
01:01:10.075 --> 01:01:12.111
I just talked to her.

778
01:01:52.984 --> 01:01:54.253
Please!

779
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:59.725
Please!

780
01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:02.694
Can we...
can we just stop fighting?

781
01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:18.777
I know you are all fighting

782
01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:22.147
because you're scared
and confused.

783
01:02:24.082 --> 01:02:26.085
I'm confused too.

784
01:02:29.521 --> 01:02:31.090
All day...

785
01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:35.194
I don't know
what the heck is going on.

786
01:02:36.261 --> 01:02:38.797
But somehow...

787
01:02:39.731 --> 01:02:42.134
this feels like
it's all my fault.

788
01:02:57.882 --> 01:03:00.419
I don't know.

789
01:03:02.454 --> 01:03:04.356
The only thing I do know...

790
01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.426
is that we have to be kind.

791
01:03:13.031 --> 01:03:14.633
Please.

792
01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:16.301
Be kind...

793
01:03:17.068 --> 01:03:20.105
especially when
we don't know what's going on.

794
01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:40.926
Hey. Evelyn!

795
01:03:42.427 --> 01:03:44.062
Bagel.

796
01:03:46.564 --> 01:03:49.334
Evelyn...

797
01:03:50.935 --> 01:03:54.206
You can still turn around
and avoid all this.

798
01:03:54.239 --> 01:03:55.774
Please...

799
01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.076
be kind.

800
01:04:00.845 --> 01:04:03.648
It's too late. Waymond.

801
01:04:06.251 --> 01:04:08.120
Don't say that.

802
01:04:27.605 --> 01:04:29.941
Did you see that?

803
01:04:32.176 --> 01:04:33.678
Ooh! Ooh-ooh! Ooh!

804
01:04:33.711 --> 01:04:35.313
- Huh! Found it!
- Check this!

805
01:04:35.346 --> 01:04:37.849
What song is this?

806
01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:43.221
Thanks. Thank you for coming.

807
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:46.124
That's very funny.

808
01:04:46.958 --> 01:04:48.760
- Yeah. that's it?
- Yeah!

809
01:05:48.119 --> 01:05:49.688
I'm sorry too.

810
01:06:21.319 --> 01:06:23.221
Oh!

811
01:06:24.622 --> 01:06:27.459
So cute!

812
01:06:27.492 --> 01:06:29.561
Come on. Evelyn.

813
01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.064
Come on.

814
01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.335
Oh.

815
01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:39.304
I get it.

816
01:06:42.473 --> 01:06:44.443
Feeling a good thing.

817
01:06:45.677 --> 01:06:47.446
You got your hopes up.

818
01:06:48.346 --> 01:06:50.882
So I'm here
to save you some time.

819
01:06:53.685 --> 01:06:55.354
Eventually...

820
01:06:58.556 --> 01:07:00.125
that all just goes away.

821
01:07:00.158 --> 01:07:02.293
Just goes away.

822
01:07:02.326 --> 01:07:03.528
Come on.

823
01:07:34.859 --> 01:07:37.762
I don't care
if you come with me.

824
01:07:37.795 --> 01:07:39.564
Enjoy your life.

825
01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:59.084
Ugh!

826
01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:01.453
Evelyn! Evelyn. please!

827
01:08:01.486 --> 01:08:03.221
No more!

828
01:08:05.256 --> 01:08:07.225
I don't want to hurt you.

829
01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:15.767
Joy. come back with me.

830
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.336
Joy! Joy!

831
01:08:28.246 --> 01:08:32.050
What did my silly husband
say to you?

832
01:08:33.451 --> 01:08:36.054
He told me about your situation.

833
01:08:37.522 --> 01:08:40.825
I remembered when my husband
served me papers.

834
01:08:40.858 --> 01:08:44.696
I drove his Kia Forte
through my neighbour's kitchen.

835
01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:46.464
Huh!

836
01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:48.299
But you know what I say?

837
01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:52.771
It's called.
"Unlovable bitches like us..."

838
01:08:53.838 --> 01:08:56.341
"Make the world go 'round."

839
01:09:04.115 --> 01:09:06.084
Don't stop playing.

840
01:09:06.117 --> 01:09:08.420
Play something for me.

841
01:09:23.501 --> 01:09:25.403
That's not true.

842
01:09:28.606 --> 01:09:31.709
- You're not unlovable.
- You're not unlovable!

843
01:09:31.742 --> 01:09:33.812
What are you talking about?

844
01:09:33.845 --> 01:09:36.248
There is always
something to love.

845
01:09:37.315 --> 01:09:40.118
Even in a stupid.
stupid universe

846
01:09:40.151 --> 01:09:43.354
where we have
hot dogs for fingers.

847
01:09:43.387 --> 01:09:45.723
we'd get very good
with our feet.

848
01:10:03.608 --> 01:10:05.143
Oh!

849
01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:10.949
- See?
- OK.

850
01:10:10.982 --> 01:10:13.718
I feel nothing.

851
01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:17.155
I... I feel...

852
01:10:17.188 --> 01:10:19.057
I feel...

853
01:10:31.002 --> 01:10:33.504
Don't let her stop Jobu!

854
01:10:33.537 --> 01:10:34.906
Open fire!

855
01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:30.929
So stupid!

856
01:11:47.945 --> 01:11:49.314
Evelyn?

857
01:11:50.915 --> 01:11:52.283
What are you doing?

858
01:11:52.316 --> 01:11:56.588
I'm learning to fight like you.

859
01:12:38.129 --> 01:12:39.964
You know. Evelyn. my wife

860
01:12:39.997 --> 01:12:41.866
used to wear
that exact same perfume.

861
01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:43.501
God rest her soul.

862
01:12:48.672 --> 01:12:50.475
These are direct indications

863
01:12:50.508 --> 01:12:52.910
that there's some impingement
of the nervous system.

864
01:12:54.211 --> 01:12:55.480
With a little bit of help.

865
01:12:55.513 --> 01:12:58.082
we could be seeing things
nice and straight.

866
01:13:01.685 --> 01:13:03.321
You might feel a little sore.

867
01:13:03.354 --> 01:13:05.289
but everything
is looking pretty good.

868
01:13:05.322 --> 01:13:07.559
Thank you.

869
01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:13.698
Clean up in there. alright?

870
01:13:23.074 --> 01:13:24.409
Hah!

871
01:14:25.769 --> 01:14:28.106
You took everything
away from me.

872
01:14:28.139 --> 01:14:29.808
I'm sorry.

873
01:14:30.574 --> 01:14:33.411
Raccaccoonie taught me so much!

874
01:14:33.444 --> 01:14:35.813
I... I didn't even know

875
01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:37.348
how to boil an egg

876
01:14:37.381 --> 01:14:41.953
and he taught me
how to spin it on a spatula.

877
01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.756
I'm useless alone.

878
01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:49.527
We're all useless alone.

879
01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.963
It's a good thing
you're not alone.

880
01:14:52.930 --> 01:14:53.998
Oh!

881
01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:57.869
Let's go rescue
your silly raccoon.

882
01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:02.140
Oh. we're gonna do it!

883
01:15:26.297 --> 01:15:29.300
Arggh!

884
01:15:34.104 --> 01:15:36.340
Oh-ho-ho!

885
01:15:51.855 --> 01:15:53.991
Get out of the way!

886
01:16:09.707 --> 01:16:11.643
Waymond!

887
01:16:22.886 --> 01:16:24.288
See?

888
01:16:24.321 --> 01:16:25.890
It's only a matter of time

889
01:16:25.923 --> 01:16:27.658
before everything
balances itself out.

890
01:16:27.691 --> 01:16:29.560
- Come on. come on. come on!
- I can't.

891
01:16:29.593 --> 01:16:32.363
I'm sorry. Raccaccoonie!
I'm sorry!

892
01:16:36.433 --> 01:16:39.170
Evelyn. let her go.

893
01:17:21.545 --> 01:17:24.181
But she turned out
to be stubborn.

894
01:17:24.214 --> 01:17:27.685
aimless. a mess.

895
01:17:27.718 --> 01:17:29.621
Just like her mother.

896
01:17:30.554 --> 01:17:32.523
But now I see.

897
01:17:32.556 --> 01:17:35.126
It's OK that she's a mess.

898
01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.430
Because just like me...

899
01:17:39.463 --> 01:17:41.199
Huh.

900
01:19:28.105 --> 01:19:30.307
Well. maybe you win
in this universe.

901
01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:32.743
but in another time...

902
01:19:36.713 --> 01:19:39.016
I beat you!

903
01:19:40.217 --> 01:19:41.385
Ohh!

904
01:19:41.418 --> 01:19:43.220
Or we tie!

905
01:19:47.891 --> 01:19:50.227
Or we just...

906
01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.796
hang around.

907
01:19:51.829 --> 01:19:53.764
OK. Joy. listen.

908
01:19:55.566 --> 01:19:56.934
Because it's all
just a pointless

909
01:19:56.967 --> 01:19:58.536
swirling bucket of bullshit.

910
01:19:58.569 --> 01:20:00.204
Huh!

911
01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:05.810
That bagel is where
we finally find peace. Evelyn.

912
01:20:08.946 --> 01:20:12.683
Stop calling me Evelyn!

913
01:20:24.161 --> 01:20:25.396
I

914
01:20:25.429 --> 01:20:27.965
Am.

915
01:20:27.998 --> 01:20:30.034
Your

916
01:20:30.067 --> 01:20:31.803
mother!

917
01:20:41.745 --> 01:20:43.181
Ah Ba?

918
01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.355
Seriously?

919
01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:53.624
Can you please just...

920
01:20:53.657 --> 01:20:56.260
stop?!

921
01:20:58.662 --> 01:21:00.498
Mom.

922
01:21:00.531 --> 01:21:02.967
Just... just stop.

923
01:21:03.767 --> 01:21:06.404
Good for you.
You're figuring your shit out.

924
01:21:07.838 --> 01:21:12.143
And that's great. I'm really.
really happy for you.

925
01:21:13.443 --> 01:21:15.313
But I'm...

926
01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:18.483
I'm tired.

927
01:21:20.651 --> 01:21:22.152
I don't want to hurt anymore.

928
01:21:22.185 --> 01:21:24.922
And for some reason
when I'm with you. it just...

929
01:21:26.957 --> 01:21:29.293
it just hurts the both of us.

930
01:21:32.896 --> 01:21:36.200
So let's just go
our separate ways. OK?

931
01:21:37.768 --> 01:21:40.271
Just let me go.

932
01:21:52.583 --> 01:21:54.218
OK.

933
01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.289
Wait.

934
01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:39.730
You are getting fat.

935
01:22:39.763 --> 01:22:41.131
And you never call me

936
01:22:41.164 --> 01:22:42.600
even though we have
a family plan.

937
01:22:42.633 --> 01:22:44.234
- What?
- And it's free.

938
01:22:44.267 --> 01:22:46.770
You only visit
when you need something.

939
01:22:46.803 --> 01:22:48.973
And you got a tattoo
and I don't care

940
01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:51.408
if it's supposed
to represent our family.

941
01:22:51.441 --> 01:22:53.010
You know I hate tattoos.

942
01:22:53.043 --> 01:22:55.779
And of all the places
I could be.

943
01:22:55.812 --> 01:22:58.248
why would I want
to be here with you?

944
01:22:58.281 --> 01:23:00.484
Yes. you're right.

945
01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:02.419
It doesn't make sense.

946
01:23:02.452 --> 01:23:03.588
Evelyn!

947
01:23:04.721 --> 01:23:06.424
Let her finish.

948
01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:10.595
Maybe it's like you said.

949
01:23:11.662 --> 01:23:14.298
Maybe there is
something out there.

950
01:23:14.331 --> 01:23:16.033
some new discovery

951
01:23:16.066 --> 01:23:17.635
that will make us feel

952
01:23:17.668 --> 01:23:20.538
like even smaller
pieces of shit.

953
01:23:21.672 --> 01:23:23.841
Something that explains why

954
01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:26.844
you still went looking for me

955
01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:29.347
through all of this noise.

956
01:23:31.581 --> 01:23:33.250
And why.

957
01:23:33.283 --> 01:23:35.285
no matter what.

958
01:23:35.318 --> 01:23:37.989
I still want
to be here with you.

959
01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:42.093
I will always...

960
01:23:43.393 --> 01:23:44.996
always...

961
01:23:45.762 --> 01:23:48.499
want to be here with you.

962
01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:53.037
So what? You...

963
01:23:55.972 --> 01:23:59.010
You're just gonna
ignore everything else?

964
01:23:59.976 --> 01:24:03.147
You could be anything. anywhere.

965
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:10.054
Why not go somewhere
where your...

966
01:24:12.889 --> 01:24:15.393
where your daughter
is more than just...

967
01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.963
this?

968
01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:22.833
Here. all we get

969
01:24:22.866 --> 01:24:26.136
are a few specks of time

970
01:24:26.169 --> 01:24:29.707
where any of this
actually makes any sense.

971
01:24:35.479 --> 01:24:37.281
Then I will Cherish

972
01:24:37.314 --> 01:24:40.551
these few specks of time.

973
01:24:48.158 --> 01:24:50.427
You push the button.

974
01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.663
Yeah. there you go.

975
01:24:52.696 --> 01:24:54.431
I feel like I'm 14.

976
01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:56.633
Yeah.

977
01:24:56.666 --> 01:24:59.937
You're a crazy woman!

978
01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:01.705
Takes one to know one.

979
01:25:01.738 --> 01:25:05.242
I'm sorry. Raccaccoonie!
I'm sorry!

980
01:25:05.275 --> 01:25:07.645
- What are you doing?
- Grab my hair.

981
01:25:21.691 --> 01:25:24.095
What did he say?

982
01:25:51.388 --> 01:25:54.658
♪ We're a family... ♪

983

This is awkward. right?

986
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:49.613
Do you still want
to do your party?

987
01:26:50.814 --> 01:26:53.517
We can do whatever we want.

988
01:26:57.654 --> 01:26:59.156
Nothing matters.

989
01:27:12.736 --> 01:27:15.706
OK. we're definitely
late now. guys.

990
01:27:17.874 --> 01:27:19.576
Do you have to bring all these?

991
01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:20.878
Mmm-hmm.

992
01:27:20.911 --> 01:27:22.846
That needs to go in the bag too.

993
01:27:22.879 --> 01:27:25.816
Taxes suck.

994
01:27:34.925 --> 01:27:36.861
Thank you for the ride. Becky!

995
01:27:37.861 --> 01:27:39.796
Hey. it's good.

996
01:27:39.829 --> 01:27:41.231
Mmm-hmm. You got this. OK?

997
01:27:41.264 --> 01:27:42.699
- Becky?
- I'll call you after.

998
01:27:42.732 --> 01:27:44.568
You need to grow your hair.

999
01:27:48.238 --> 01:27:49.873
Wow.

1000
01:27:53.009 --> 01:27:54.978
I'll call you later!

1001
01:27:55.011 --> 01:27:56.680
Hurry. hurry!

1002
01:28:01.217 --> 01:28:02.920
I gotta pee. Hold on.

1003
01:28:02.953 --> 01:28:04.688
OK. Hurry.

1004
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:43.226
OK. Yes.

1005
01:28:43.259 --> 01:28:46.663
I am happy to say I do think

1006
01:28:46.696 --> 01:28:47.998
things are better.

1007
01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:50.267
This is... this is
an improvement.

1008
01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.336
And I'm glad that you listened.

1009
01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:54.171
But we have a problem

1010
01:28:54.204 --> 01:28:56.473
because you listened.
but you didn't listen

1011
01:28:56.506 --> 01:28:58.342
and that has to do
with the Schedule C.

1012
01:28:58.375 --> 01:29:01.411
You see. you did...

1013
01:29:11.621 --> 01:29:13.991
Evelyn! Did you hear me?

1014
01:29:14.024 --> 01:29:17.461

1
00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:07.275
Ugh!

2
00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:09.444
You know. of all
the Evelyns I've seen...

3
00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:13.581
you're definitely one of
the more interesting ones.

4
00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:18.286
What do you want from me?

5
00:00:24.492 --> 00:00:25.927
Here.

6
00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:34.102
Let me help you
open up your mind. huh?

7
00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:36.871
Hmm?

8
00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:39.641
- Oh!
- Here.

9
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.880
Open up.

10
00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:49.050
It's OK.

11
00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:53.555
It's OK.

12
00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:55.690
Take a peek.

13
00:01:11.372 --> 00:01:13.541
Oh. shit.

14
00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.176
What is that?

15
00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.878
I got bored one day

16
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:20.115
and I put everything on a bagel.

17
00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:24.485
Everything.

18
00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:28.790
All my hopes and dreams.
my old report cards.

19
00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:30.124
every breed of dog.

20
00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.961
every last personal ad
on craigslist.

21
00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:35.730
Sesame.

22
00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:37.465
Poppy seed.

23
00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:40.068
Salt.

24
00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:43.337
And it collapsed in on itself.

25
00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.941
'Cause. you see.
when you really put

26
00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:49.677
everything on a bagel.

27
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.746
it becomes this.

28
00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:53.748
Come on. Run. Evelyn.

29
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:55.984
The truth.

30
00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:00.689
What is the truth?

31
00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:04.292
Nothing...

32
00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.362
matters.

33
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.299
No. Joy.

34
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:14.436
You don't believe that.

35
00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:17.605
Feels nice. doesn't it?

36
00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:21.109
If nothing matters...

37
00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.345
then all the pain
and guilt you feel

38
00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:27.082
for making nothing
of your life...

39
00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:30.351
it goes away.

40
00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.991
♪ Sucked

41
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.729
♪ Into

42
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:45.900
♪ A bagel. ♪

43
00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:50.739
No!

44
00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:01.649
- Ah Ba?

45
00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.384
I'm not your father.

46
00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.753
At least not the one you know.

47
00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:07.789
I am Alpha Gong Gong.

48
00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:09.757
- Huh!
- Not you too!

49
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.996
Sir. what are you doing here?

50
00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:17.398
We need to go. Just follow me.

51
00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:34.382
Sir. I have this under control.

52
00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:37.285
Again.
you deliberately disobey me

53
00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:41.022
and cause another mind
to be compromised.

54
00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:47.995
And now you know
what we must do.

55
00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:50.364
No! Please.

56
00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.333
She's unlike anything
we've seen.

57
00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:55.102
She could finally stop
Jobu Tupaki.

58
00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:57.705
You mean the monster
that is inside my daughter?

59
00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:00.308
Well. why didn't you tell me
about it earlier?

60
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.910
What else are you Alpha people
not telling me?

61
00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:05.213
Did you see her
dance that man to death?

62
00:04:05.246 --> 00:04:09.684
There is no way I am
the Evelyn you are looking for.

63
00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:12.053
No. I see it so clearly.

64
00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:14.155
See what?

65
00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:18.292
I'm no good at anything.

66
00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:19.527
Exactly.

67
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.996
I've seen thousands of Evelyns.

68
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.398
but never an Evelyn like you.

69
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.268
You have so many goals
you never finished.

70
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:29.971
dreams you never followed.

71
00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:32.674
You're living your worst you.

72
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:37.912
I cannot be the worst.
What about that hot dog one?

73
00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:40.214
No. Can't you see?

74
00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:43.084
Every failure here
branched off into a success

75
00:04:43.117 --> 00:04:45.052
for another Evelyn
in another life.

76
00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:48.189
Most people only
have a few significant

77
00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:50.591
alternate life paths
so close to them.

78
00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.927
But you. here.

79
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.897
you're capable of anything

80
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.167
because you're so bad
at everything.

81
00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:05.406
What good is all that power
when her mind

82
00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.176
is already succumbing
to that chaos. huh?

83
00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.879
Hello?

84
00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:13.714
Hello? Mom. Dad?
What's going on?

85
00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:16.317
No. Do not answer her.

86
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.653
It's one of her tricks.

87
00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:21.923
Sir. our readings indicate
it's not Jobu Tupaki.

88
00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:24.292
But if she's not here...

89
00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:29.063
Oh. shit!

90
00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:35.636
Do not engage! Run! Run!

91
00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.439
Watch these two here
while I deal with Jobu.

92
00:05:38.472 --> 00:05:42.576
I'm not risking the safety
of the Alphaverse for this.

93
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.416
Get us as far away
from Joy as you can.

94
00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:49.984
- Why?
- I'll be back. I promise.

95
00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:52.153
No. no. no. wait.
Why don't you...

96
00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:53.254
Huh?

97
00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:54.922
- Hello?
- Joy?

98
00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:56.199
- No. no... That's not...
- Joy's here!

99
00:05:56.223 --> 00:05:57.634
- No. no. no. that's not Joy.
- Hello?

100
00:05:57.658 --> 00:06:01.262
- Joy? Joy. I'm coming.
- Let me in.

101
00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:04.499
OK. be patient! This is heavy.

102
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.202
- Joy. why are you here?
- I have no fucking clue!

103
00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:10.338
- Hey. gentle language!
- Just what is going on?

104
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.907
I'm sure there's a very good
explanation for all of this...

105
00:06:14.308 --> 00:06:16.811
What the fuck. Mom?!

106
00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:19.914
What the fuck are you doing?

107
00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:30.425
But... she's too powerful.

108
00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:34.295
Are we all having a stroke?

109
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.374
You are like puppets.
You know? Puppets?

110
00:06:46.407 --> 00:06:49.110
You can do things
you normally cannot do.

111
00:06:49.143 --> 00:06:51.212
It's like that movie.

112
00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:53.514
Um. you... you... That movie...

113
00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:55.016
OK. what are you talking about?

114
00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:56.717
- A movie?
- 'Raccaccoonie'!

115
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.885
- What?
- Huh?

116
00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:58.853
'Raccaccoonie'. you know?

117
00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:00.921
The one with the chef...

118
00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:02.590
And he makes bad food. Phooey.

119
00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:04.692
And then this raccoon
sit on his head.

120
00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:08.829
ooh. control him.
and then he cooks good food.

121
00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:11.032
Do you mean 'Ratatouille'?

122
00:07:11.065 --> 00:07:12.600
'Ratatouille'?
I like that movie.

123
00:07:12.633 --> 00:07:15.002
No. No. no. no. no. no.
'Raccaccoonie'!

124
00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:16.170
With the raccoon.

125
00:07:16.203 --> 00:07:17.738
- OK...
- Raccoon?

126
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.507
Everybody.
stop making up sounds!

127
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.676
So there's a raccoon Joy.
and there's a raccoon me?

128
00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:24.412
And they are controlling us?

129
00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:26.280
Yeah. from the other universes.

130
00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:30.084
- Oh. OK.
- That's very funny. Evelyn.

131
00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:33.821
OK. it sounds a little bit
ridiculous. but it's true.

132
00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:35.356
I swear to God. you...

133
00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:36.757
You are macho man.

134
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.526
- I like that!
- Oh. yeah.

135
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:42.329
Hey. honey. don't worry.

136
00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:44.131
- Daddy will get you out of this.
- Ah Ba?

137
00:07:44.164 --> 00:07:47.468
Quickly.
while she is distracted.

138
00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:50.371
- No.
- It's only protocol.

139
00:07:50.404 --> 00:07:53.307
It gives her one
less universe to access.

140
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.608
God...

141
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.444
- Can you...
- Oh. it's Becky.

142
00:07:56.477 --> 00:07:57.945
Hi. Becky. Hold on.

143
00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:00.181
How do you expect to defeat
her in every universe

144
00:08:00.214 --> 00:08:01.916
if you can't even
kill her in one?

145
00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:03.317
Hey. babe.

146
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.319
She's your granddaughter.

147
00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:09.256
How do you think I feel?

148
00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:11.225
But this is a sacrifice

149
00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:13.861
that is necessary
to win the war.

150
00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:16.497
OK. there we go.

151
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:22.537
You must do it.

152
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.406
Go.

153
00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:29.510
Go.

154
00:08:29.543 --> 00:08:31.645
Yeah. my mom
taped me to a chair.

155
00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.814
Uh. because of raccoons.

156
00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.916
- OK. be patient.
- Yeah. it's a long story.

157
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.985
- Daddy's trying to...
- It's been a day.

158
00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:46.694
Mom?

159
00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:48.362
I don't like this at all.

160
00:08:57.905 --> 00:08:59.607
What are you...

161
00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:03.778
what are you doing?

162
00:09:07.281 --> 00:09:09.183
Hey! I almost had it.

163
00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:10.684
Oh. come on!

164
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.119
You are already under her spell.

165
00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:14.321
Holy shit!
Holy shit. he has a gun!

166
00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:15.589
Everyone. stay calm!

167
00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:17.233
I think it's time
for a family discussion!

168
00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:19.326
It's OK. it's OK. it's OK.

169
00:09:22.663 --> 00:09:25.032
I won't let you kill her.

170
00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:28.769
Don't you see what
is happening to your mind?

171
00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:31.739
In my universe.

172
00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:36.043
you pushed your own daughter
too hard until you broke her.

173
00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.946
You...

174
00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:41.849
you created Jobu Tupaki.

175
00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:43.951
When did he get
so good at English?

176
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.154
Now I must stop you.

177
00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:49.290
Otherwise. it's only
a matter of time

178
00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:53.728
before you become just like her.

179
00:09:55.262 --> 00:09:59.533
Just like her?

180
00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:08.709
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you doing?

181
00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:11.579
Evelyn. I don't think now
is a good time to dance!

182
00:10:15.215 --> 00:10:16.550
Baba.

183
00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:18.285
I know you don't agree with me.

184
00:10:18.318 --> 00:10:19.853
but this is something
I have to do.

185
00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:21.555
- What the...
- That sounds weird.

186
00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:23.357
No. no. no...

187
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.292
- OK.
- Wait!

188
00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:26.605
You don't know
where you'll jump.

189
00:10:29.263 --> 00:10:31.199
Enough!

190
00:10:32.232 --> 00:10:34.001
Warning. Unstable.

191
00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:47.548
Please.

192
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.584
I cannot lose another
loved one to the darkness.

193
00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:54.755
- Warning. Unstable.
- Don't worry. You won't.

194
00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:10.271
Hey. uh. clean up
in there. alright?

195
00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:12.006
Here. Oh!

196
00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:16.043
Where did she jump?!

197
00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:17.745
Sorry. Ah Ba.

198
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.049
- Whoa!
- OK!

199
00:11:22.082 --> 00:11:23.660
- Come on. come on. come on!
- Jesus. Mom!

200
00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:24.918
- That way!
- Oh. no!

201
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:26.720
- Oh. my God!
- Come on. come on!

202
00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:28.122
- Oh!
- No!

203
00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:30.791
Warning. mind fracturing.

204
00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:34.428
Send every Jumper with
a counterpart in the area.

205
00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:36.664
Now!

206
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:40.267
Once again.
the Alphaverse finds itself

207
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.772
as the last line of defence
against total chaos.

208
00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:48.909
Be brave. This Evelyn
is as stubborn as the others.

209
00:11:48.942 --> 00:11:51.111
She has given us no choice.

210
00:11:51.144 --> 00:11:55.683
We must kill her before she
becomes another Jobu Tupaki.

211
00:11:57.517 --> 00:11:59.920
- Joy.
- Oh. what?

212
00:11:59.953 --> 00:12:01.789
Joy... Joy...

213
00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:06.860
I know you have these feelings.

214
00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:10.731
feelings that make you so sad.

215
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:15.903
That makes you just...
just want to give up.

216
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.106
It's not your fault.

217
00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.609
Not your fault.

218
00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:24.278
I know.

219
00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:27.481
It's... it's her.

220
00:12:27.514 --> 00:12:30.317
Juju Chewbacca.

221
00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:35.789
She has your soul...

222
00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:37.591
in the palm of her hand.

223
00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:38.926
What are you talking about?

224
00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:43.097
The only way I can
defeat her to save you...

225
00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:46.667
is to become like her.

226
00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:52.039
Evelyn!

227
00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:54.441
Your daughter is beyond saving.

228
00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:56.610
And soon you will be too.

229
00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:02.449
Your time is up.

230
00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:04.852
Find your jumping pads.

231
00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:10.958
♪ Ave Maria... ♪

232
00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:16.864
♪ Ave Maria... ♪

233
00:13:24.504 --> 00:13:26.774
Mom? Mom?

234
00:13:26.807 --> 00:13:29.377
I think
you're pushing things too far.

235
00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:32.946
Or not far enough.

236
00:13:34.714 --> 00:13:36.884
Oh. my God! Oh. my God!

237
00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:41.155
Evelyn?

238
00:13:41.188 --> 00:13:42.856
- Ugh!
- Oh. my God.

239
00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:46.894
Oh!

240
00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:48.662
What are you doing?!

241
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.459
Mom!

242
00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:49.316
Arggh!

243
00:15:54.387 --> 00:15:55.823
Ohh!

244
00:16:10.737 --> 00:16:13.574
Holy... shit.

245
00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:15.175
Is he dead?

246
00:16:17.877 --> 00:16:19.980
See. not dead. Go!

247
00:16:20.013 --> 00:16:22.213
- That's definitely not...
- Hurry up. please. Go quick!

248
00:16:22.782 --> 00:16:24.785
OK. come on. guys.

249
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.555
Dad. go!

250
00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:37.064
Oh. my God.

251
00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:43.237
Does my baby
want to go for a walk?

252
00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:53.680
Yow!

253
00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:57.985
No!

254
00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.487
Oh. Johnny! Oh!

255
00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.157
Orange soda?

256
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.993
- Huh?
- What is she doing?

257
00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:07.794
I think when
she does something weird

258
00:17:07.827 --> 00:17:09.596
it helps her fight.
it gives her power.

259
00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:14.001
Sorry. baby.

260
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.510
Ask her for another one.

261
00:17:31.151 --> 00:17:32.919
No! Johnny!

262
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.360
Fried egg?

263
00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:43.664
You... bitch.

264
00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:48.435
Go!

265
00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:52.172
Huh?

266
00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:53.941
Oh...

267
00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:56.076
Evelyn. if you don't step up.

268
00:17:56.109 --> 00:17:57.978
I'm giving some
of your shifts to Chad.

269
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.749
Yeah!

270
00:18:02.782 --> 00:18:04.551
- Oh. my God!
- Oh. good one!

271
00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.852
I got a picture!

272
00:18:18.665 --> 00:18:20.434
Go.

273
00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:05.312
Stop...

274
00:19:05.345 --> 00:19:07.013
- Huh? What happened?
- You stop!

275
00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:08.181
I think they lost their...

276
00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:09.983
- Stop it!
- ..powers?

277
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.385
Sir?

278
00:19:12.418 --> 00:19:14.488
I am gonna need
another jumping pad.

279
00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:16.690
Received information. Over.

280
00:19:23.296 --> 00:19:25.074
I think she needs to do
something weird again.

281
00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:26.633
What's he doing?

282
00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:39.913
Oh. my God. He's trying
to stick it in his butt.

283
00:19:39.946 --> 00:19:41.715
No!

284
00:19:42.816 --> 00:19:44.251
- No. no. no!
- Ah... No!

285
00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:48.088
Ah. Evelyn. do jumping Jacks!

286
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:49.489
That's not weird at all.

287
00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:50.924
Um... Slap him!

288
00:19:50.957 --> 00:19:52.626
No. no. no. no!

289
00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:54.728
Mom. just blow on his nose!

290
00:19:54.761 --> 00:19:56.029
What?

291
00:19:56.062 --> 00:19:57.631
It'll make him involuntarily

292
00:19:57.664 --> 00:19:59.299
scream and do weird noises.

293
00:19:59.332 --> 00:20:01.768
Trust her. Evelyn!
It's really weird.

294
00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.189
Wow. Mom is really good.

295
00:20:56.222 --> 00:20:58.392
Huh!

296
00:20:59.893 --> 00:21:01.428
Sorry.

297
00:21:21.047 --> 00:21:22.449
Oh!

298
00:21:24.584 --> 00:21:26.186
Arggh!

299
00:21:34.093 --> 00:21:35.762
Ahh!

300
00:21:56.416 --> 00:21:58.218
Reaching mental capacity.

301
00:22:00.086 --> 00:22:01.721
Reaching mental capacity.

302
00:22:03.957 --> 00:22:04.957
Holy shit!

303
00:22:06.225 --> 00:22:09.229
- Ow!
- I'm sorry. Evelyn.

304
00:22:09.262 --> 00:22:11.398
- Mind fracturing.
- We'll die together.

305
00:22:31.084 --> 00:22:33.186
Pinky... Arggh!

306
00:22:35.588 --> 00:22:37.591
- Get her. I see her.
- Let's go!

307
00:23:12.992 --> 00:23:14.260
Evelyn!

308
00:23:14.293 --> 00:23:16.196
Evelyn. Evelyn!

309
00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:17.364
Whoa. whoa!

310
00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:24.237
No need to explain.

311
00:23:26.139 --> 00:23:28.008
I have been watching you.

312
00:23:28.041 --> 00:23:30.677
You're back!

313
00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:33.580
Did you see how good I am?

314
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.182
I'm gonna do it.

315
00:23:36.215 --> 00:23:39.919
I am going to defeat
that Jobu Tupaki.

316
00:23:39.952 --> 00:23:42.689
Hey. You got her name right.

317
00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:48.862
Evelyn. what you're doing
is crazy. reckless.

318
00:23:48.895 --> 00:23:52.365
Your stupid plan to somehow
save your daughter

319
00:23:52.398 --> 00:23:56.303
has managed to piss off
everyone in the multiverse.

320
00:23:57.503 --> 00:23:59.539
But it just might work.

321
00:24:03.176 --> 00:24:04.477
What? What?

322
00:24:17.657 --> 00:24:19.893
I only wish I could be there

323
00:24:19.926 --> 00:24:21.127
to see you finish this.

324
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.096
What do you mean.
you don't see me finish?

325
00:24:23.129 --> 00:24:25.198
I'm grateful

326
00:24:25.231 --> 00:24:26.866
that chance was kind enough

327
00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:29.803
to let us have these
last few moments together.

328
00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:47.354
Alpha Waymond?

329
00:24:48.121 --> 00:24:49.956
Alpha Waymond?

330
00:24:49.989 --> 00:24:52.158
What happened?

331
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:54.528
Was I Raccoon Waymond again?

332
00:24:57.597 --> 00:24:59.432
Raccoon Waymond is dead.

333
00:25:03.102 --> 00:25:04.905
Is that Raccoon Joy?

334
00:25:05.905 --> 00:25:07.374
Am I getting it?

335
00:25:09.542 --> 00:25:11.478
I can to stop you. Jobu...

336
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:14.781
now that I am reaching
my full potential.

337
00:25:14.814 --> 00:25:17.317
Oh. you still can't see
what's happening.

338
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.419
No. I see clearly.

339
00:25:19.452 --> 00:25:22.956
More clearly than ever before.

340
00:25:38.137 --> 00:25:40.440
Oh. my God! Evelyn.

341
00:25:41.741 --> 00:25:43.009
Oh. my God!

342
00:25:44.911 --> 00:25:47.714
Damn it. So close.

00:27:33.219 --> 00:27:34.621
- No. no!
- Get her! Get her!

367
00:27:34.654 --> 00:27:35.755
- No. I... No. No!
- Please.

368
00:27:35.788 --> 00:27:37.323
- Get her!
- Just go! Just go!

369
00:27:45.031 --> 00:27:46.499
What do you want?

370
00:27:46.532 --> 00:27:48.434
I want you.

371
00:27:48.467 --> 00:27:50.503
No!

372
00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:52.739
Stop that!

373
00:27:52.772 --> 00:27:55.408
Oh!

374
00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:57.043
- Oh!
- Stay back!

375
00:27:57.076 --> 00:27:58.311
This is wrong!

376
00:27:58.344 --> 00:28:00.580
- This is wrong!
- What? It's not wrong!

377
00:28:16.562 --> 00:28:18.298
I... I'm late.

378
00:28:22.168 --> 00:28:26.606
I can think of whatever nonsense
I want and somewhere...

379
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.092
I did it.

380
00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:47.794
Huh?

381
00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:55.501
Don't forget these cookies.

382
00:28:55.534 --> 00:28:57.304
Miss Deirdre really likes them.

383
00:29:28.267 --> 00:29:29.803
Come on.

384
00:29:36.709 --> 00:29:39.379
Hi. Mrs Wang.

385
00:29:39.412 --> 00:29:41.013
Hey. Mom.
So. about this morning...

386
00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:42.782
- Enough with your tricks.
- What?

387
00:29:42.815 --> 00:29:44.092
- I know you're in there.
- Whoa.

388
00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:45.618
- Get out of my daughter.
- OK!

389
00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:47.253
Mom. are you already drunk?

390
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.393
- Hey. Becky.
- Mmm-hmm?

391
00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.297
Can you go help my dad
with the party?

392
00:29:59.165 --> 00:30:00.666
Now?

393
00:30:00.699 --> 00:30:02.769
- Yeah.
- Go. Becky.

394
00:30:02.802 --> 00:30:04.570
Go. Go.

395
00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:08.808
Thanks. babe.

396
00:30:12.778 --> 00:30:14.914
You see it all. don't you?

397
00:30:19.585 --> 00:30:22.555
You can see

398
00:30:22.588 --> 00:30:24.424
how everything...

399
00:30:25.558 --> 00:30:27.794
is just a random rearrangement

400
00:30:27.827 --> 00:30:32.198
of particles
in a vibrating superposition.

401
00:30:37.703 --> 00:30:40.106
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

402
00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:42.308
But I can do this.

403
00:30:43.742 --> 00:30:45.211
Huh?

404
00:30:45.244 --> 00:30:47.613
But you see...

405
00:30:47.646 --> 00:30:49.816
how everything we do...

406
00:30:49.849 --> 00:30:51.651
Huh?

407
00:30:53.686 --> 00:30:55.955
Gets washed away in a sea

408
00:30:55.988 --> 00:30:58.324
of every other possibility?

409
00:31:02.394 --> 00:31:03.997
You're everywhere.

410
00:31:06.265 --> 00:31:07.834
You're like me.

411
00:31:08.601 --> 00:31:09.936
That's right.

412
00:31:09.969 --> 00:31:12.605
I'm the one you're looking for.

413
00:31:12.638 --> 00:31:15.141
I'm the one
who's going to defeat you.

414
00:31:15.174 --> 00:31:17.043
OK.

415
00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:20.780
Hit me.

416
00:31:22.581 --> 00:31:24.184
Punch my face.

417
00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:34.393
Oh...

418
00:31:34.426 --> 00:31:36.462
Oh! Ow! Ow!

419
00:31:36.495 --> 00:31:39.232
- Oh. stop!
- Wow.

420
00:31:41.367 --> 00:31:43.436
Hi. Dad.

421
00:31:45.804 --> 00:31:48.941
We're... we're just practising
karaoke for tonight.

422
00:31:48.974 --> 00:31:51.010
♪ La-la-la! ♪

423
00:31:52.378 --> 00:31:54.046
I will take care of it!

424
00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:56.148
- She'll take care of it. Dad.
- Go.

425
00:31:56.181 --> 00:31:57.383
- Honey. you OK?
- It's OK.

426
00:31:57.416 --> 00:31:59.685
- Go!
- Yeah. I just fell on the couch.

427
00:31:59.718 --> 00:32:01.187
Go!

428
00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.789
OK.

429
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:05.858
Oh.

430
00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:07.494
- Ow...
- He's so sweet.

431
00:32:09.295 --> 00:32:11.297
OK.

432
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.999
Hey. hey. buddy!

433
00:32:13.032 --> 00:32:17.303
If you don't want
to fight me. then...

434
00:32:17.336 --> 00:32:19.005
- Why?
- Why what?

435
00:32:19.038 --> 00:32:20.873
What... what's all this for?

436
00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:25.411
Why was I looking for you?

437
00:32:25.444 --> 00:32:27.013
Yeah.

438
00:32:30.516 --> 00:32:32.218
Sit down.

439
00:32:32.985 --> 00:32:34.754
Sit down. grab a snack.

440
00:32:34.787 --> 00:32:36.622
make yourself comfortable. huh?

441
00:32:36.655 --> 00:32:39.125
- Oh. hey. you OK?
- OK.

442
00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:43.563
Mmm. We can speed this up.

443
00:32:43.596 --> 00:32:46.899
Sit on the crack.

444
00:32:46.932 --> 00:32:49.201
Sit on the crack
of the couch. OK?

445
00:32:49.234 --> 00:32:50.436
Get comfortable.

446
00:33:01.714 --> 00:33:03.382
Bagel.

447
00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:09.155
Please. I don't care
about the bagel.

448
00:33:09.188 --> 00:33:11.057
I don't care
about the Alphaverse.

449
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.892
I only care about my Joy.

450
00:33:12.925 --> 00:33:14.160
Give me back my daughter

451
00:33:14.193 --> 00:33:15.828
and I'll leave you
alone forever.

452
00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:18.331
Sorry! No can do.

453
00:33:18.364 --> 00:33:19.465
Why not?

454
00:33:19.498 --> 00:33:22.168
I am your daughter.
Your daughter is me.

455
00:33:22.201 --> 00:33:26.939
Every version of Joy
is Jobu Tupaki.

456
00:33:26.972 --> 00:33:29.542
- You can't separate us.
- No.

457
00:33:29.575 --> 00:33:34.213
I have felt everything
your daughter has felt.

458
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.554
And I know the joy...

459
00:33:42.955 --> 00:33:45.959
and the pain of having you
as my mother.

460
00:33:47.726 --> 00:33:50.262
Then you know I would do...

461
00:33:50.295 --> 00:33:54.434
Only do the right thing
for her. for you.

462
00:33:55.434 --> 00:33:59.472
'Right' is a tiny box invented
by people who are afraid

463
00:33:59.505 --> 00:34:03.476
and I know what it feels like
to be trapped inside that box.

464
00:34:06.445 --> 00:34:08.014
Mom...

465
00:34:08.047 --> 00:34:09.949
No. it's not like that.

466
00:34:09.982 --> 00:34:11.584
It's Gong Gong.

467
00:34:11.617 --> 00:34:12.918
He's a different generation.

468
00:34:12.951 --> 00:34:15.388
You don't have to hide
behind him anymore.

469
00:34:15.421 --> 00:34:17.123
You should feel relieved.

470
00:34:17.156 --> 00:34:20.526
The bagel will show you
the true nature of things.

471
00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:23.863
You'll be free from that box.
just like me.

472
00:34:23.896 --> 00:34:26.198
No. no. I'm not like you.

473
00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:29.568
You're young and your mind
is always changing.

474
00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:31.771
I still know who I am.

475
00:34:31.804 --> 00:34:34.006
You have no idea
what you've done.

476
00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:36.643
You're stuck like this forever.

477
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.047
No. I'm going back with my Joy.

478
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.350
to my family. to live my life.

479
00:34:44.383 --> 00:34:45.785
A happy life.

480
00:34:45.818 --> 00:34:47.787
OK.

481
00:34:49.822 --> 00:34:51.991
Good luck with that.

482
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.338
Thank you so much for coming.

483
00:35:11.343 --> 00:35:13.579
Thank you. Thank your father.

484
00:35:27.025 --> 00:35:29.128
All this time...

485
00:35:30.596 --> 00:35:34.100
I wasn't looking for you
so I could kill you.

486
00:35:36.535 --> 00:35:40.973
I was just looking for someone
who could see what I see.

487
00:35:43.008 --> 00:35:46.446
Feel what I feel.

488
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.803
And that someone...

489
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.776
is you.

490
00:36:18.577 --> 00:36:20.446
Evelyn!

491
00:36:20.479 --> 00:36:23.316
- You're alive!
- Impossible.

492
00:36:27.386 --> 00:36:29.121
- Hello?
- Mrs Wang?

493
00:36:29.154 --> 00:36:30.556
Where... where are you?

494
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:34.393
I mean. to not even show up
for your appointment?!

495
00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:35.661
Shut up.

496
00:36:35.694 --> 00:36:36.896
What did you just say?

497
00:36:36.929 --> 00:36:38.798
I said shut up.

498
00:36:38.831 --> 00:36:40.299
You don't matter.

499
00:36:40.332 --> 00:36:42.368
Whatever I did. I'm sorry.

500
00:36:42.401 --> 00:36:43.669
Nothing matters.

501
00:36:43.702 --> 00:36:45.538
Mrs Wang!

502
00:36:45.571 --> 00:36:48.674
You are gonna
be in serious trouble!

503
00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:50.576
Do you understand?

504
00:36:50.609 --> 00:36:53.012
For you to disrespect...

505
00:37:19.037 --> 00:37:22.541
Happy New Year!

506
00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:24.376
Another year. hmm?

507
00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:26.312
Pretending we know
what we're doing.

508
00:37:26.345 --> 00:37:30.550
but. really. we're just going
around in circles.

509
00:37:31.817 --> 00:37:34.220
Doing laundry and taxes.

510
00:37:34.253 --> 00:37:36.289
and laundry and taxes.

511
00:37:44.263 --> 00:37:45.798
- No more running.
- Excuse me.

512
00:37:45.831 --> 00:37:48.167
Where are the owners? Oh.

513
00:37:48.934 --> 00:37:51.037
There you are. Mr and Mrs Wang.

514
00:37:51.803 --> 00:37:56.442
You have left me no option
but to authorise the seizure

515
00:37:56.475 --> 00:37:59.011
of your personal
and your business assets.

516
00:37:59.044 --> 00:38:00.813
- You have to vacate...
- Wait. Evelyn!

517
00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:09.788
It's just so good. you know?

518
00:38:09.821 --> 00:38:11.657
What are you doing? No! No!

519
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.326
My God. Chad. I told
you she couldn't be trusted!

520
00:38:14.359 --> 00:38:16.429
Evelyn. please! Calm down.

521
00:38:17.296 --> 00:38:19.598
Within 48 hours or...

522
00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:29.508
Everything...

523
00:38:32.778 --> 00:38:34.046
Ugh!

524
00:38:39.885 --> 00:38:41.654
What are you doing?

525
00:38:47.659 --> 00:38:50.129
Not a single moment will go by

526
00:38:50.162 --> 00:38:51.997
without every other universe

527
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:54.367
screaming for your attention.

528
00:38:56.768 --> 00:38:58.904
Never fully there.

529
00:38:58.937 --> 00:39:01.507
Just a lifetime of...

530
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.942
No. no!

531
00:39:02.975 --> 00:39:04.143
Fractured moments.

532
00:39:04.176 --> 00:39:06.045
Raccaccoonie!

533
00:39:06.078 --> 00:39:08.747
Contradictions and confusion...

534
00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.883
- Get off me!
- Chad. don't forget about me.

535
00:39:10.916 --> 00:39:12.351
Here are the papers.

536
00:39:12.384 --> 00:39:16.589
- Oh! Oh. officer?
- OK. OK.

537
00:39:23.862 --> 00:39:25.698
With only a few specks of time

538
00:39:25.731 --> 00:39:28.968
where anything
actually makes any sense.

539
00:39:31.269 --> 00:39:34.540
I've always hated this place.

540
00:39:41.013 --> 00:39:42.548
Raccaccoonie!

541
00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:44.116
Chad!

542
00:39:46.852 --> 00:39:49.722
Get off me! Get off!

543
00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:03.769
Evelyn. why?!

544
00:43:11.489 --> 00:43:14.426
Do you know why
I actually built the bagel?

545
00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.697
It wasn't to destroy everything.

546
00:43:19.598 --> 00:43:22.067
It was to destroy myself.

547
00:43:23.068 --> 00:43:27.139
I wanted to see if I went in.
could I finally escape?

548
00:43:29.307 --> 00:43:31.677
Like. actually die.

549
00:43:34.145 --> 00:43:36.182
At least this way...

550
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:39.185
I don't have to do it alone.

551
00:43:45.523 --> 00:43:47.192
You're not listening.

552
00:43:47.225 --> 00:43:49.094
This is out of my league...

553
00:43:49.127 --> 00:43:51.363
Judge Brenner signed...

554
00:43:54.666 --> 00:43:58.070
Well. excuse me!
Excuse me. Mr Wang.

555
00:43:58.103 --> 00:44:00.014
Every person I know
is going through a hard time.

556
00:44:00.038 --> 00:44:02.942
- It's a hard time...
- Evelyn!

557
00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:07.947
Come back.

558
00:44:12.584 --> 00:44:15.120
My silly husband.

559
00:44:15.153 --> 00:44:18.257
Probably making things worse.

560
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.059
Ignore it.

561
00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:27.566
OK. you can let her go.

562
00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:33.639
You. let her go. It's OK. Yes!

563
00:44:35.407 --> 00:44:37.042
Thank you.

564
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.127
How? That's impossible.

565
00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.663
It's just
a statistical inevitability.

566
00:44:57.696 --> 00:44:59.765
It's nothing special.

567
00:45:08.373 --> 00:45:10.042
I don't know.

568
00:45:10.075 --> 00:45:12.111
I just talked to her.

569
00:45:52.984 --> 00:45:54.253
Please!

570
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:59.725
Please!

571
00:45:59.758 --> 00:46:02.694
Can we...
can we just stop fighting?

572
00:46:17.442 --> 00:46:18.777
I know you are all fighting

573
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:22.147
because you're scared
and confused.

574
00:46:24.082 --> 00:46:26.085
I'm confused too.

575
00:46:29.521 --> 00:46:31.090
All day...

576
00:46:32.624 --> 00:46:35.194
I don't know
what the heck is going on.

577
00:46:36.261 --> 00:46:38.797
But somehow...

578
00:46:39.731 --> 00:46:42.134
this feels like
it's all my fault.

579
00:46:57.882 --> 00:47:00.419
I don't know.

580
00:47:02.454 --> 00:47:04.356
The only thing I do know...

581
00:47:05.323 --> 00:47:07.426
is that we have to be kind.

582
00:47:13.031 --> 00:47:14.633
Please.

583
00:47:14.666 --> 00:47:16.301
Be kind...

584
00:47:17.068 --> 00:47:20.105
especially when
we don't know what's going on.

585
00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:40.926
Hey. Evelyn!

586
00:47:42.427 --> 00:47:44.062
Bagel.

587
00:47:46.564 --> 00:47:49.334
Evelyn...

588
00:47:50.935 --> 00:47:54.206
You can still turn around
and avoid all this.

589
00:47:54.239 --> 00:47:55.774
Please...

590
00:47:56.541 --> 00:47:58.076
be kind.

591
00:48:00.845 --> 00:48:03.648
It's too late. Waymond.

592
00:48:06.251 --> 00:48:08.120
Don't say that.

593
00:48:27.605 --> 00:48:29.941
Did you see that?

594
00:48:32.176 --> 00:48:33.678
Ooh! Ooh-ooh! Ooh!

595
00:48:33.711 --> 00:48:35.313
- Huh! Found it!
- Check this!

596
00:48:35.346 --> 00:48:37.849
What song is this?

597
00:48:40.919 --> 00:48:43.221
Thanks. Thank you for coming.

598
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:46.124
That's very funny.

599
00:48:46.958 --> 00:48:48.760
- Yeah. that's it?
- Yeah!

600
00:49:48.119 --> 00:49:49.688
I'm sorry too.

601
00:50:21.319 --> 00:50:23.221
Oh!

602
00:50:24.622 --> 00:50:27.459
So cute!

603
00:50:27.492 --> 00:50:29.561
Come on. Evelyn.

604
00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:32.064
Come on.

605
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.335
Oh.

606
00:50:37.368 --> 00:50:39.304
I get it.

607
00:50:42.473 --> 00:50:44.443
Feeling a good thing.

608
00:50:45.677 --> 00:50:47.446
You got your hopes up.

609
00:50:48.346 --> 00:50:50.882
So I'm here
to save you some time.

610
00:50:53.685 --> 00:50:55.354
Eventually...

611
00:50:58.556 --> 00:51:00.125
that all just goes away.

612
00:51:00.158 --> 00:51:02.293
Just goes away.

613
00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:03.528
Come on.

614
00:51:34.859 --> 00:51:37.762
I don't care
if you come with me.

615
00:51:37.795 --> 00:51:39.564
Enjoy your life.

616
00:51:56.948 --> 00:51:59.084
Ugh!

617
00:51:59.117 --> 00:52:01.453
Evelyn! Evelyn. please!

618
00:52:01.486 --> 00:52:03.221
No more!

619
00:52:05.256 --> 00:52:07.225
I don't want to hurt you.

620
00:52:13.965 --> 00:52:15.767
Joy. come back with me.

621
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.336
Joy! Joy!

622
00:52:28.246 --> 00:52:32.050
What did my silly husband
say to you?

623
00:52:33.451 --> 00:52:36.054
He told me about your situation.

624
00:52:37.522 --> 00:52:40.825
I remembered when my husband
served me papers.

625
00:52:40.858 --> 00:52:44.696
I drove his Kia Forte
through my neighbour's kitchen.

626
00:52:44.729 --> 00:52:46.464
Huh!

627
00:52:46.497 --> 00:52:48.299
But you know what I say?

628
00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:52.771
It's called.
"Unlovable bitches like us..."

629
00:52:53.838 --> 00:52:56.341
"Make the world go 'round."

630
00:53:04.115 --> 00:53:06.084
Don't stop playing.

631
00:53:06.117 --> 00:53:08.420
Play something for me.

632
00:53:23.501 --> 00:53:25.403
That's not true.

633
00:53:28.606 --> 00:53:31.709
- You're not unlovable.
- You're not unlovable!

634
00:53:31.742 --> 00:53:33.812
What are you talking about?

635
00:53:33.845 --> 00:53:36.248
There is always
something to love.

636
00:53:37.315 --> 00:53:40.118
Even in a stupid.
stupid universe

637
00:53:40.151 --> 00:53:43.354
where we have
hot dogs for fingers.

638
00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:45.723
we'd get very good
with our feet.

639
00:54:03.608 --> 00:54:05.143
Oh!

640
00:54:08.746 --> 00:54:10.949
- See?
- OK.

641
00:54:10.982 --> 00:54:13.718
I feel nothing.

642
00:54:13.751 --> 00:54:17.155
I... I feel...

643
00:54:17.188 --> 00:54:19.057
I feel...

644
00:54:31.002 --> 00:54:33.504
Don't let her stop Jobu!

645
00:54:33.537 --> 00:54:34.906
Open fire!

646
00:55:29.827 --> 00:55:30.929
So stupid!

647
00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:49.314
Evelyn?

648
00:55:50.915 --> 00:55:52.283
What are you doing?

649
00:55:52.316 --> 00:55:56.588
I'm learning to fight like you.

650
00:56:38.129 --> 00:56:39.964
You know. Evelyn. my wife

651
00:56:39.997 --> 00:56:41.866
used to wear
that exact same perfume.

652
00:56:41.899 --> 00:56:43.501
God rest her soul.

653
00:56:48.672 --> 00:56:50.475
These are direct indications

654
00:56:50.508 --> 00:56:52.910
that there's some impingement
of the nervous system.

655
00:56:54.211 --> 00:56:55.480
With a little bit of help.

656
00:56:55.513 --> 00:56:58.082
we could be seeing things
nice and straight.

657
00:57:01.685 --> 00:57:03.321
You might feel a little sore.

658
00:57:03.354 --> 00:57:05.289
but everything
is looking pretty good.

659
00:57:05.322 --> 00:57:07.559
Thank you.

660
00:57:11.929 --> 00:57:13.698
Clean up in there. alright?

661
00:57:23.074 --> 00:57:24.409
Hah!

662
00:58:25.769 --> 00:58:28.106
You took everything
away from me.

663
00:58:28.139 --> 00:58:29.808
I'm sorry.

664
00:58:30.574 --> 00:58:33.411
Raccaccoonie taught me so much!

665
00:58:33.444 --> 00:58:35.813
I... I didn't even know

666
00:58:35.846 --> 00:58:37.348
how to boil an egg

667
00:58:37.381 --> 00:58:41.953
and he taught me
how to spin it on a spatula.

668
00:58:43.521 --> 00:58:45.756
I'm useless alone.

669
00:58:47.091 --> 00:58:49.527
We're all useless alone.

670
00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.963
It's a good thing
you're not alone.

671
00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:53.998
Oh!

672
00:58:55.533 --> 00:58:57.869
Let's go rescue
your silly raccoon.

673
00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:02.140
Oh. we're gonna do it!

674
00:59:26.297 --> 00:59:29.300
Arggh!

675
00:59:34.104 --> 00:59:36.340
Oh-ho-ho!

676
00:59:51.855 --> 00:59:53.991
Get out of the way!

677
01:00:09.707 --> 01:00:11.643
Waymond!

678
01:00:22.886 --> 01:00:24.288
See?

679
01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:25.890
It's only a matter of time

680
01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:27.658
before everything
balances itself out.

681
01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:29.560
- Come on. come on. come on!
- I can't.

682
01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:32.363
I'm sorry. Raccaccoonie!
I'm sorry!

683
01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:39.170
Evelyn. let her go.

684
01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:24.181
But she turned out
to be stubborn.

685
01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:27.685
aimless. a mess.

686
01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:29.621
Just like her mother.

687
01:01:30.554 --> 01:01:32.523
But now I see.

688
01:01:32.556 --> 01:01:35.126
It's OK that she's a mess.

689
01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.430
Because just like me...

690
01:01:39.463 --> 01:01:41.199
Huh.

691
01:03:28.105 --> 01:03:30.307
Well. maybe you win
in this universe.

692
01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.743
but in another time...

693
01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:39.016
I beat you!

694
01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:41.385
Ohh!

695
01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:43.220
Or we tie!

696
01:03:47.891 --> 01:03:50.227
Or we just...

697
01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.796
hang around.

698
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:53.764
OK. Joy. listen.

699
01:03:55.566 --> 01:03:56.934
Because it's all
just a pointless

700
01:03:56.967 --> 01:03:58.536
swirling bucket of bullshit.

701
01:03:58.569 --> 01:04:00.204
Huh!

702
01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:05.810
That bagel is where
we finally find peace. Evelyn.

703
01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:12.683
Stop calling me Evelyn!

704
01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:25.396
I

705
01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.965
Am.

706
01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:30.034
Your

707
01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:31.803
mother!

708
01:04:41.745 --> 01:04:43.181
Ah Ba?

709
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.355
Seriously?

710
01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.624
Can you please just...

711
01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:56.260
stop?!

712
01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:00.498
Mom.

713
01:05:00.531 --> 01:05:02.967
Just... just stop.

714
01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:06.404
Good for you.
You're figuring your shit out.

715
01:05:07.838 --> 01:05:12.143
And that's great. I'm really.
really happy for you.

716
01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:15.313
But I'm...

717
01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.483
I'm tired.

718
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:22.152
I don't want to hurt anymore.

719
01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:24.922
And for some reason
when I'm with you. it just...

720
01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:29.293
it just hurts the both of us.

721
01:05:32.896 --> 01:05:36.200
So let's just go
our separate ways. OK?

722
01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:40.271
Just let me go.

723
01:05:52.583 --> 01:05:54.218
OK.

724
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.289
Wait.

725
01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:39.730
You are getting fat.

726
01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:41.131
And you never call me

727
01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.600
even though we have
a family plan.

728
01:06:42.633 --> 01:06:44.234
- What?
- And it's free.

729
01:06:44.267 --> 01:06:46.770
You only visit
when you need something.

730
01:06:46.803 --> 01:06:48.973
And you got a tattoo
and I don't care

731
01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:51.408
if it's supposed
to represent our family.

732
01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:53.010
You know I hate tattoos.

733
01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:55.779
And of all the places
I could be.

734
01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:58.248
why would I want
to be here with you?

735
01:06:58.281 --> 01:07:00.484
Yes. you're right.

736
01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.419
It doesn't make sense.

737
01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:03.588
Evelyn!

738
01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:06.424
Let her finish.

739
01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:10.595
Maybe it's like you said.

740
01:07:11.662 --> 01:07:14.298
Maybe there is
something out there.

741
01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:16.033
some new discovery

742
01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:17.635
that will make us feel

743
01:07:17.668 --> 01:07:20.538
like even smaller
pieces of shit.

744
01:07:21.672 --> 01:07:23.841
Something that explains why

745
01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:26.844
you still went looking for me

746
01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:29.347
through all of this noise.

747
01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:33.250
And why.

748
01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:35.285
no matter what.

749
01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:37.989
I still want
to be here with you.

750
01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:42.093
I will always...

751
01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:44.996
always...

752
01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:48.499
want to be here with you.

753
01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:53.037
So what? You...

754
01:07:55.972 --> 01:07:59.010
You're just gonna
ignore everything else?

755
01:07:59.976 --> 01:08:03.147
You could be anything. anywhere.

756
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:10.054
Why not go somewhere
where your...

757
01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:15.393
where your daughter
is more than just...

758
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.963
this?

759
01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:22.833
Here. all we get

760
01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:26.136
are a few specks of time

761
01:08:26.169 --> 01:08:29.707
where any of this
actually makes any sense.

762
01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:37.281
Then I will Cherish

763
01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:40.551
these few specks of time.

764
01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:50.427
You push the button.

765
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.663
Yeah. there you go.

766
01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:54.431
I feel like I'm 14.

767
01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.633
Yeah.

768
01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:59.937
You're a crazy woman!

769
01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:01.705
Takes one to know one.

770
01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:05.242
I'm sorry. Raccaccoonie!
I'm sorry!

771
01:09:05.275 --> 01:09:07.645
- What are you doing?
- Grab my hair.

772
01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:24.095
What did he say?

773
01:09:51.388 --> 01:09:54.658
♪ We're a family... ♪

774
01:09:59.596 --> 01:10:04.468

775
01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.803
This is so awkward.

776
01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:42.840
This is awkward. right?

777
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:49.613
Do you still want
to do your party?

778
01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:53.517
We can do whatever we want.

779
01:10:57.654 --> 01:10:59.156
Nothing matters.

780
01:11:12.736 --> 01:11:15.706
OK. we're definitely
late now. guys.

781
01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:19.576
Do you have to bring all these?

782
01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:20.878
Mmm-hmm.

783
01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:22.846
That needs to go in the bag too.

784
01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:25.816
Taxes suck.

785
01:11:34.925 --> 01:11:36.861
Thank you for the ride. Becky!

786
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:39.796
Hey. it's good.

787
01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:41.231
Mmm-hmm. You got this. OK?

788
01:11:41.264 --> 01:11:42.699
- Becky?
- I'll call you after.

789
01:11:42.732 --> 01:11:44.568
You need to grow your hair.

790
01:11:48.238 --> 01:11:49.873
Wow.

791
01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:54.978
I'll call you later!

792
01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:56.680
Hurry. hurry!

793
01:12:01.217 --> 01:12:02.920
I gotta pee. Hold on.

794
01:12:02.953 --> 01:12:04.688
OK. Hurry.

795
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.226
OK. Yes.

796
01:12:43.259 --> 01:12:46.663
I am happy to say I do think

797
01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:47.998
things are better.

798
01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:50.267
This is... this is
an improvement.

799
01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.336
And I'm glad that you listened.

800
01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:54.171
But we have a problem

801
01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:56.473
because you listened.
but you didn't listen

802
01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:58.342
and that has to do
with the Schedule C.

803
01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:01.411
You see. you did...

804
01:13:11.621 --> 01:13:13.991
Evelyn! Did you hear me?

805
01:13:14.024 --> 01:13:17.461

01:13.250 --> 01:17.666
KENYA 2008

01:17.750 --> 01:20.333
Coming in…
Special Anti-Terrorism Squad chief

01:20.416 --> 01:22.541
Rajiv Menon has been found
to be a traitor.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.958
An officer in his Branch
has found evidence

01:25.041 --> 01:27.541
of his involvement
in various terrorism plots.

01:27.625 --> 01:28.958
Including 26/11.

01:29.375 --> 01:33.208
This News has created a massive concern
in the Intelligence community.

01:33.333 --> 01:37.583
The Govt of India has started
a nationwide manhunt for his arrest.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.708
Train speed, 80 kilometers per hour.

02:21.833 --> 02:24.166
The chopper will land in 80 seconds.

02:24.625 --> 02:25.541
Guys.

02:26.291 --> 02:27.166
Be ready.

02:47.958 --> 02:48.875
Scientist has arrived, sir.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.041
Ari, take him to the lab.

04:14.625 --> 04:15.458
What?

04:15.625 --> 04:17.750
I don't think this uranium is original.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.208
It is fake.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.166
To double-check this,

04:22.250 --> 04:24.166
I need to take
this uranium to my lab.

04:24.875 --> 04:25.708
Only then--

04:26.666 --> 04:27.500
Sorry, bro.

04:28.958 --> 04:30.500
Only then can I be…

04:31.458 --> 04:33.583
200% sure whether it is original or--

04:35.041 --> 04:35.875
Again.

04:37.666 --> 04:39.708
Original or fake?

04:40.083 --> 04:40.916
Kalyan sir?

04:46.166 --> 04:48.458
Don't worry, buddy.
On my way.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.541
I need…

04:53.375 --> 04:54.250
some time.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.625
Uranium is original.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.333
Only the scientist here is fake.

05:20.375 --> 05:22.416
Welcome on board, Mr. Gandhi.

05:29.166 --> 05:32.041
I've come to see many men
disguised as Gandhi.

05:32.458 --> 05:33.708
But for the first time,

05:34.500 --> 05:36.541
I saw Gandhi in disguise!

06:54.666 --> 06:57.666
Even if my disguise is exposed…

07:00.875 --> 07:02.541
I am Gandhi as always, I say!

08:48.916 --> 08:50.125
Ready, baby?

08:50.625 --> 08:53.041
Hey! I was born ready, dude.

08:55.416 --> 08:56.458
Gandhi sir!

08:56.541 --> 08:58.791
Only four minutes left
to smuggle the uranium

08:58.875 --> 09:00.625
Hey! Why are you yelling, bro?

09:01.333 --> 09:02.750
Give me a few more minutes.

09:03.541 --> 09:05.000
I'll get Menon too.

09:05.291 --> 09:06.208
What?!

09:06.708 --> 09:07.583
Menon?!

09:07.666 --> 09:10.750
Yes, dude, I came to
grab the uranium and kill Omar.

09:11.833 --> 09:13.958
I have Menon as a special offer now.

09:14.541 --> 09:15.958
As if I can leave him behind!

10:09.250 --> 10:10.125
Gandhi.

10:11.666 --> 10:12.583
Let's go!

10:15.416 --> 10:17.083
Hey! We'll deal with him later, hurry up.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.541
What are you doing there?
Make it fast.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.166
Coming!

10:24.333 --> 10:25.250
Fast!

10:41.375 --> 10:42.208
Coming up.

10:58.541 --> 10:59.875
Where's Gandhi, dude?

11:00.791 --> 11:02.125
Gandhi, make it fast!

11:29.750 --> 11:30.625
Thalapathy!

11:37.583 --> 11:38.750
His entry spells power

11:38.833 --> 11:40.166
-Who is our master?
-Commander!

11:44.500 --> 11:46.166
Greatest General of them all

12:06.500 --> 12:08.500
DELHI

12:20.291 --> 12:23.333
Hey! Shall I start a party of my own?

12:23.500 --> 12:25.625
Rock and roll, in every town?

12:26.458 --> 12:29.166
Shall I begin the campaign?

12:29.375 --> 12:31.500
Pick up the mic and not abstain?

12:32.583 --> 12:34.125
Hey! One minute.
What did you say?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.500
I said, "Shall I open the champagne?"

12:36.708 --> 12:39.000
Champagne?
I heard "campaign"!

12:39.083 --> 12:41.541
Hey! Proves you are drunk as a skunk!

12:41.791 --> 12:42.666
All ears now.

12:42.916 --> 12:44.208
Start music.

12:55.875 --> 13:01.041
Hey! Shall I host a party of my own?
Rock and roll, in every town?

13:01.875 --> 13:07.083
Shall I open the champagne?
Pick up the mic and not restrain?

13:07.958 --> 13:10.791
If you hear the clap of thunder
It's my voice echoing all over

13:10.875 --> 13:13.666
If you hear fireworks explode
It is my boys in revelry mode

13:13.875 --> 13:16.625
Allies are our dear citizens secure

13:16.833 --> 13:19.583
You'll never leave my party for sure

13:19.666 --> 13:22.625
Need more sound, whistle night and day

13:22.750 --> 13:25.458
Do not nit-pick, whistle away

13:25.666 --> 13:28.375
Let the action spread, whistle, and sway

13:28.458 --> 13:31.583
Hey guys and girls, no gender bias
Whistle, in all the centers, every dais

13:31.666 --> 13:37.458
Whistle for G.O.A.T, pure magic
Whistle, rock and roll automatic

13:37.541 --> 13:40.250
Whistle to hunt the dragon

13:40.333 --> 13:43.458
Hey, guys and girls, come on
whistle with me, and sing along

13:56.958 --> 13:58.208
Whistle night and day

13:59.833 --> 14:01.166
Whistle sing and sway

14:02.791 --> 14:04.083
Whistle any which way

14:07.250 --> 14:09.916
You were born to celebrate

14:10.166 --> 14:12.875
Why did you forget the reason innate?

14:13.083 --> 14:18.625
You opened your eyes just
To see other faces smile happily

14:19.041 --> 14:21.791
Steal your enemy's heart, dude

14:22.000 --> 14:24.958
Analyze why they are mad at you

14:25.041 --> 14:27.708
Introspect, take a call often

14:27.958 --> 14:31.041
Deal with your life every now and then

14:31.166 --> 14:33.833
The sky won't fade, it is endless

14:34.125 --> 14:36.541
Our earth won't vanish, it is timeless

14:36.625 --> 14:42.750
Till the last drop of spirit is shared
Our party will continue unshattered

15:05.375 --> 15:06.458
Hey!

15:06.541 --> 15:12.291
We don't hear koels sing
In places sans water flowing

15:12.375 --> 15:18.208
We don't see peacocks plumage-spread
When eyes blurred with tears unshed

15:18.291 --> 15:21.000
Moonwalk, trend set by Michael Jackson

15:21.083 --> 15:24.083
Marlon Brando known for his role as don

15:24.166 --> 15:26.875
You want a change, walk with a purpose

15:26.958 --> 15:30.125
Our vote for your party is unanimous

15:31.458 --> 15:33.000
Whistle night and day

15:34.416 --> 15:36.083
Whistle sing and sway

15:37.375 --> 15:38.791
Whistle any which way

15:38.875 --> 15:42.333
Hey friends and fans, all genders
Whistle, in all the centers

15:44.250 --> 15:45.250
Move and groove

15:47.041 --> 15:48.208
Rock and roll

15:50.166 --> 15:51.125
Loosen up, set it free

16:24.083 --> 16:28.708
Need more sound, whistle night and day

16:29.625 --> 16:35.375
Hey! Do not nit-pick, whistle away

16:37.625 --> 16:39.791
Whistle and sway

16:44.458 --> 16:45.791
Thank God she's asleep!

16:48.000 --> 16:49.958
Switch on the light

16:54.208 --> 16:55.083
Switch on the light.

17:00.291 --> 17:01.166
What?

17:01.875 --> 17:04.541
Doctor's orders, you need to sleep.
Especially in your final trimester.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.791
Go back to bed.

17:06.958 --> 17:07.791
I will take care.

17:08.750 --> 17:09.750
Let me go pee.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.333
-The toilet is over here.
-Correct.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.416
-This side.
-Changed it?

17:18.291 --> 17:19.208
Had dinner?

17:20.041 --> 17:21.000
Yes.

17:21.916 --> 17:22.833
I asked if you had dinner.

17:33.666 --> 17:35.875
I swear, hereafter,
I must stop drinking.

17:36.958 --> 17:38.833
She is watching my every move.

17:42.958 --> 17:47.791
Which divine hill among all, guarantees
To fulfill the wishes of all its devotees?

17:48.750 --> 17:54.333
Which hill stretches across so divine
All over Kongu region as a gem sublime?

17:55.625 --> 18:01.333
Which hill showers God's Grace
To all families always in all ways?

18:02.583 --> 18:06.041
The sanctuary sought by heavenly beings

18:06.125 --> 18:07.000
Lord Muruga, bless me.

18:07.083 --> 18:10.875
Marudhamalai

18:12.916 --> 18:13.791
What is this?

18:15.625 --> 18:17.666
-Your dad's work?
-Yes, Ma.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.750
He is utterly useless!

18:19.833 --> 18:22.208
Marudhamalai

18:22.291 --> 18:23.291
Muruga

18:23.500 --> 18:28.083
Lord Muruga, gem of Marudhamalai precious

18:28.250 --> 18:32.958
Your trident guards your devotee's pious

18:33.916 --> 18:35.375
I haven't even showered yet!

18:35.458 --> 18:37.333
Doesn't matter, dear.
God won't be mad at you.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.375
Your coffee is waiting
for you on the dining table.

18:39.458 --> 18:41.625
Is this your way of repentance
for yesterday's sloshed state?

18:46.416 --> 18:48.041
Listen. Hello?

18:49.416 --> 18:50.708
He has to go to school only at 8:30 a.m.

18:50.791 --> 18:53.125
Why did you wake him up at 6:30 a.m.
and deck him up as a mini-saint?!

18:53.208 --> 18:55.041
He shouldn't be late to school,
that's why.

18:55.125 --> 18:57.791
Is he the scapegoat for
your drinking revelry?

18:57.875 --> 18:59.916
Why are you bringing that up
in front of our son?

19:00.458 --> 19:01.833
I swear I won't drink ever again, happy?

19:01.958 --> 19:05.125
You swore you'd never drink
when I was expecting Jeevan.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.750
Now you promise on our second son too.

19:06.833 --> 19:08.583
Not our son. Our daughter.

19:08.708 --> 19:11.083
-I won't swear on our daughter.
-Not girl, boy for sure.

19:11.166 --> 19:13.458
We'll see all that later.
Eat, get ready, and let's go.

19:13.666 --> 19:14.541
Hey!

19:17.625 --> 19:19.541
Dad, don't come home late hereafter.

19:19.875 --> 19:21.583
Why do you feel that way,
my little prince?

19:21.791 --> 19:25.333
You apply holy ash on my forehead
and drop me early to school like this?

19:25.708 --> 19:27.833
I feel so sleepy in class, Pa.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
All that's fine.

19:29.458 --> 19:32.083
How is your teacher Shanthi?

19:32.166 --> 19:33.833
Dad, I'm seriously telling you.

19:41.708 --> 19:43.291
Tell me, Radhika.

19:43.541 --> 19:44.916
Gandhi, where are you?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.208
I'm driving Jeevan to school.

19:47.291 --> 19:51.208
Will you please come home
and pick up Sreenidhi?

19:51.291 --> 19:52.375
Isn't Sunil at home?

19:52.750 --> 19:53.666
He is here.

19:53.875 --> 19:55.875
But not in a state to drop her.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.916
Oh God! What happened?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.583
Hey! What happened to you?
Why are you sitting still as a statue?

20:05.666 --> 20:06.666
Work pressure it seems.

20:06.833 --> 20:09.041
This is the result of all-night drinking.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.000
Hi.

20:13.125 --> 20:13.958
-Cheeky fellow.
-Ma!

20:14.041 --> 20:17.166
Why are you staring blankly?
Isn't he also working in your office?

20:17.416 --> 20:18.708
Doesn't he have
the same work pressure?

20:18.916 --> 20:20.375
Look how responsible he is.

20:26.625 --> 20:27.500
Why that look?!

20:29.166 --> 20:31.041
Okay, it's getting late for school.

20:32.083 --> 20:33.791
Let's go. Come along, dear.

20:34.208 --> 20:35.125
See you in the office, dude.

20:35.750 --> 20:36.708
Gandhi.

20:37.166 --> 20:40.041
Remember Anu's appointment
is at 4:30 p.m. today?

20:41.500 --> 20:43.000
Of course, I remember.

20:58.833 --> 21:00.625
If I offer an extra peg or two
will you obey implicitly?

21:00.833 --> 21:02.125
How about using your own brain?

21:05.125 --> 21:06.958
-Morning, sir.
-Morning.

21:11.750 --> 21:12.625
Won't you keep qui--

21:13.500 --> 21:14.375
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning, sir.

21:14.583 --> 21:15.458
Morning.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.583
Sir…

21:17.333 --> 21:18.208
Shall we?

21:53.416 --> 21:55.958
Hey! Won't you oil the hinges?

21:56.041 --> 21:58.041
Does this look like a high-tech
Intelligence Office?

21:58.458 --> 21:59.750
More like a scrap dealer's go-down.

21:59.833 --> 22:02.208
Your expenses cover only our operations.

22:02.291 --> 22:05.125
If you shell out for office maintenance
we can oil everything once a week.

22:05.208 --> 22:07.500
Don't you have money even to buy oil?

22:07.583 --> 22:08.458
Sir.

22:08.958 --> 22:10.750
No problem, sir.
We can adjust and get in.

22:10.833 --> 22:11.875
Be a sport. Just watch me.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.583
Hey, move it, Madagascar.

22:15.666 --> 22:16.541
Easy!

22:31.125 --> 22:32.041
Sir.

22:32.916 --> 22:33.833
How was that?

22:34.125 --> 22:37.125
Look! What an awful blunder you've made!

22:37.375 --> 22:40.375
In our Snatch Operation, you were
asked to sneak out the uranium.

22:40.458 --> 22:42.208
You have damaged an entire train!

22:42.291 --> 22:44.416
If the Kenyan government learns
what we did,

22:44.500 --> 22:45.708
you know what mess we will get into!

22:45.791 --> 22:48.500
Sir. In this Snatch Operation,

22:48.791 --> 22:50.833
we intended to kill Omar,
Lashkar-e-Taiba's leader.

22:50.916 --> 22:53.208
And snatching the uranium from him.

22:53.458 --> 22:56.625
But unexpectedly we ran into Menon.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.791
Sir, actually we wanted
to kill Menon as well.

22:59.875 --> 23:02.583
During that process,
these three damaged the train.

23:02.666 --> 23:03.541
Forgive them.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.166
Sir, actually, what happened is--

23:05.250 --> 23:06.625
Actually, you shut up.

23:06.708 --> 23:07.875
My neck hurts.
Come in front.

23:07.958 --> 23:11.208
Sir, according to the shot
we can't see if we are in front of you.

23:11.291 --> 23:12.458
Let me be the judge.

23:12.541 --> 23:14.250
Go and stand there.
I can't stand this!

23:14.333 --> 23:15.208
Come on.

23:20.083 --> 23:20.958
Uranium.

23:21.208 --> 23:23.250
Sir, it's already been handed over
to Baba Nuclear Center.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.500
What happened to the terrorists?

23:25.708 --> 23:27.500
Sir, Omar, Menon.

23:28.041 --> 23:30.291
The entire team died
in the train blast, sir.

23:30.375 --> 23:32.000
There are no survivors on the train.

23:32.083 --> 23:33.958
Official report from
the Kenyan government.

23:36.541 --> 23:40.125
Sir, Menon must have helped Omar
in this uranium deal.

23:40.208 --> 23:42.666
We will get more details
if we investigate this, sir.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.791
How can we investigate with corpses?

23:44.875 --> 23:46.416
-Fine, you handle it.
-Sir.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.000
-Okay, Gandhi?
-Sir.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.750
Our next assignment is in Thailand.

23:49.833 --> 23:52.208
Regarding that, your flight
to Chennai is at 3:30 p.m. today.

23:52.375 --> 23:53.250
-Get ready.
-Sir.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.375
I must take my wife to the doctor
at 4:30 p.m.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.291
How sad! Is that so?

23:57.375 --> 23:59.333
The doctor will handle that.
You handle your assignment.

23:59.416 --> 24:00.291
Thank you, sir.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.125
Anu, why isn't Gandhi here with you?

24:04.208 --> 24:05.750
Phone is switched off as usual.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.500
Your baby is healthy.

24:08.666 --> 24:10.625
Take all the vitamin tablets I prescribed.

24:10.708 --> 24:12.166
Walk regularly.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.416
And do some household work.

24:15.833 --> 24:17.125
What's up?

24:17.500 --> 24:19.916
Your baby is fine.
No need to get tense.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.625
I am not worried about my baby.

24:23.041 --> 24:24.375
My tension is thanks to Gandhi!

24:24.583 --> 24:25.833
Gandhi is making you tense.

24:26.333 --> 24:27.208
Why?

24:27.750 --> 24:29.333
He is generally aloof.

24:29.708 --> 24:31.083
Doesn't come home on time.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.541
He goes out alone and talks
when he gets any calls.

24:34.208 --> 24:36.041
Maybe he's having an affair
with some woman.

24:36.291 --> 24:37.541
I have my own suspicions.

24:37.625 --> 24:40.083
Don't be suspicious of Gandhi.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.291
No way that can be true.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.708
This is pregnancy-related crankiness.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.208
It's normal for you to get upset.

24:46.416 --> 24:47.583
No, you don't know him.

24:47.916 --> 24:48.916
One day, you know what…

24:54.041 --> 24:55.000
Oh God!

24:57.458 --> 24:58.291
Tell me, dear.

24:58.458 --> 25:00.375
It is so noisy.
I can't hear you.

25:00.458 --> 25:01.875
That… that's nothing.

25:01.958 --> 25:04.000
I lowered the window in my car.

25:04.083 --> 25:05.333
So it's windy.
You tell me, dear.

25:05.458 --> 25:08.458
Will you note down this grocery list?
I need you to buy on the way back home.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.250
Yes… pen.

25:10.833 --> 25:12.541
-Pen.
-Pen.

25:13.208 --> 25:14.416
I have one, dude.

25:14.625 --> 25:16.375
Tell me, dear.
I'll note it down.

25:16.458 --> 25:18.291
One kilo of tomatoes.

25:18.791 --> 25:19.833
One kilo of tomatoes.

25:19.916 --> 25:21.166
One kilo of tomatoes.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.666
Then, dal--

25:22.750 --> 25:24.708
Which one?

25:24.833 --> 25:26.083
Half a kilo toor dal.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.916
Buy one kilo of urad dal.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.291
One kilo urad dal.
Half a kilo toor dal.

25:30.375 --> 25:31.208
One kilo--

25:31.458 --> 25:33.500
Hey! Ask if she wants sugar.

25:35.125 --> 25:36.916
No, dude, I asked
because it isn't on her list.

25:37.416 --> 25:39.250
Do you want sugar, dear?

25:39.583 --> 25:41.333
No need. Fully stocked.

25:42.041 --> 25:42.916
Hey!

25:43.375 --> 25:45.750
Who are you? I am asking you.

25:46.041 --> 25:48.000
I'll call the security now.
What are you doing here?

25:48.125 --> 25:49.083
What is that sound?

25:49.250 --> 25:51.666
-What are you doing?
-I have to act only now.

25:52.041 --> 25:53.375
What?

25:53.708 --> 25:55.458
I heard a female voice.

25:55.583 --> 25:56.666
He hung up on me.

25:57.208 --> 25:58.625
I tried calling him.
The phone was switched off.

25:59.625 --> 26:00.916
Even this can be ignored.

26:01.166 --> 26:02.083
Another day…

26:02.458 --> 26:03.500
Tell me, dear.

26:03.791 --> 26:04.708
Where are you?

26:04.791 --> 26:06.250
I'm at work, of course.

26:06.375 --> 26:07.916
You know our Muruga.

26:08.375 --> 26:09.250
He--

26:12.583 --> 26:13.958
What is that funny sound?

26:14.041 --> 26:15.750
Nothing, dear.
In my mouth-- I mean…

26:15.833 --> 26:16.666
What?

26:17.166 --> 26:19.208
-What are you saying?
-Me and my blab mouth!

26:19.291 --> 26:20.208
Hello?

26:21.583 --> 26:24.750
Wait, let me tell you
how badly he covered it up.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.041
I meant in my tummy… gas.

26:26.125 --> 26:27.791
You heard it wrong.

26:28.791 --> 26:29.625
Silly woman!

26:29.708 --> 26:31.166
And he mocked me!

26:31.708 --> 26:34.833
I swear I can sense it.
He is having an affair with a female.

26:35.375 --> 26:37.916
Even now he said he'll come
and his phone is switched off.

26:38.375 --> 26:40.000
He'll call me at night
and give me some excuse.

26:41.041 --> 26:42.375
Don't be an idiot.

26:42.833 --> 26:44.708
These guys won't ditch us.

26:45.041 --> 26:47.125
Gandhi isn't like that at all.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.708
These boys are not
as talented as you seem to think.

26:49.833 --> 26:51.875
If you are so sure about it,

26:51.958 --> 26:53.500
grab him by his
collar and ask him!

26:58.541 --> 27:00.041
Has Jeevan gone to school?

27:08.375 --> 27:10.916
What did your doctor say?

27:12.625 --> 27:13.500
All okay.

27:13.916 --> 27:14.750
By the way,

27:15.166 --> 27:16.333
your school reunion.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.000
How did it go?

27:19.916 --> 27:22.250
Reunion.
All that was fine.

27:22.416 --> 27:24.625
It got late, so I slept there.

27:25.125 --> 27:26.125
Where did you stay?

27:26.375 --> 27:27.583
His house.

27:28.416 --> 27:29.291
My buddy.

27:29.875 --> 27:31.416
My buddy Sunil.

27:31.541 --> 27:32.833
I told you last night.

27:33.291 --> 27:34.708
I forgot.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.208
You forgot?

27:36.291 --> 27:39.208
That's okay, lay the table.
I'll shower and eat.

27:42.958 --> 27:44.375
Hello? Kalyan brother?

27:44.458 --> 27:45.458
Yes, Anu.

27:46.458 --> 27:47.916
-Hello, Anu?
-Not Kalyan.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.000
-Can you hear me?
-Sunil.

27:50.083 --> 27:52.041
Last night, Gandhi…

27:52.125 --> 27:53.250
Gandhi.

27:53.625 --> 27:54.916
He stayed behind at my place.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.250
Got delayed last night.

27:56.333 --> 27:57.500
He left this morning.

27:57.958 --> 28:00.166
-Any message for him?
-No, brother, thanks.

28:03.541 --> 28:05.958
No. That's correct!

28:06.541 --> 28:08.500
Actually, Sunil dropped me
at Kalyan's place.

28:08.583 --> 28:11.916
I stayed behind only at Kalyan's house.
I should have told you that first.

28:12.750 --> 28:13.791
Dammit, I forgot that.

28:14.791 --> 28:16.833
My tongue slipped, and I was confused.

28:16.916 --> 28:19.583
Stop glaring at me like that.
I'm too stressed, I'm not lying.

28:19.666 --> 28:23.541
I downed a few extra drinks
and that's the culprit.

28:23.625 --> 28:25.041
Oh my goodness gracious!

28:25.125 --> 28:26.000
Tell me, Anu.

28:26.083 --> 28:27.416
Oh God!

28:27.500 --> 28:28.416
Nothing much, bro.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.791
Last night, Gandhi…

28:30.250 --> 28:31.208
Gandhi?

28:31.708 --> 28:34.041
He stayed behind at home
because it was too late.

28:34.166 --> 28:37.041
Look how peacefully
he's sleeping like a baby here.

28:37.250 --> 28:38.916
I feel bad to wake him up.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.458
Anything important?
Should I wake him up?

28:42.541 --> 28:43.833
-No, I'll call you later.
-Smarty!

28:43.916 --> 28:47.083
Right from childhood overacting
is second nature to him.

28:50.791 --> 28:52.416
Sunil brother or Kalyan brother?

28:54.958 --> 28:56.750
-Sunil.
-Switch onto speaker mode.

28:57.833 --> 28:58.916
Speaker mode.

29:01.916 --> 29:02.916
Tell me, dude.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.958
Gandhi, Anu called me just now.

29:05.041 --> 29:07.166
I told her you were here
and convinced her so well.

29:07.625 --> 29:10.375
You bet! She was moved
by my performance.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.916
Stick to my version, got it?

29:14.000 --> 29:15.208
Act naturally?

29:15.458 --> 29:17.791
Brother, it's been half an hour
since he got back home.

29:28.583 --> 29:29.750
Say something, buddy.

29:30.250 --> 29:33.083
We are in this mess
because I said "something"!

29:33.666 --> 29:34.583
Ask him to speak up.

29:38.333 --> 29:39.166
Anu, dear…

29:40.833 --> 29:42.583
Sorry, last night was a bit excessive.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.291
We were partying till the wee hours.

29:44.375 --> 29:46.000
We spoke without thinking.

29:46.166 --> 29:47.416
-Please.
-True.

29:48.541 --> 29:49.875
You know what friendship is?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.166
Not just having a good time
and painting the town red.

29:52.375 --> 29:53.791
If he is going astray, pull him up.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.625
Advise him on what to do
and what not to do.

29:57.208 --> 29:59.250
I call you "anna" since I think of you
as my brother.

29:59.333 --> 30:01.166
Did you think of me as your sister?

30:01.375 --> 30:02.208
Anu.

30:02.375 --> 30:05.375
If you really had a younger sister
and her husband was behaving like this,

30:05.625 --> 30:06.750
won't you question him?

30:06.875 --> 30:08.041
Yes, we will.

30:08.125 --> 30:09.208
Then why didn't you?

30:10.541 --> 30:11.833
What the hell did you do, dude?

30:12.208 --> 30:14.041
This won't work for me.

30:14.208 --> 30:15.708
I need an answer. Yes or no?

30:15.916 --> 30:18.875
Either he should live with me
or go after the girl he fancies.

30:18.958 --> 30:22.041
I'm educated, I have a good job.
I can take care of myself and my baby.

30:22.125 --> 30:23.000
I can manage everything.

30:23.083 --> 30:26.000
-I can't tolerate this any longer.
-Hey, stop this nonsense.

30:26.541 --> 30:28.458
What happened now?
Why are you so hyper?

30:29.375 --> 30:31.041
I swear there is
no other female, tell her.

30:31.708 --> 30:33.041
Am I having an affair or what?

30:33.125 --> 30:34.166
Not at all, Anu.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.875
No, as if I don't know.

30:36.208 --> 30:38.750
He gets frequent calls
and he steps outside and speaks.

30:38.833 --> 30:40.041
If I follow him, he cuts the call.

30:40.125 --> 30:41.458
-No, Anu.
-What is he up to?

30:41.541 --> 30:43.791
What is his job?
I have no clue, I'm so confused.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.500
-Hey.
-I swear I just can't believe this.

30:47.083 --> 30:48.000
You're suspecting me?

30:48.083 --> 30:49.583
You made me suspect you!

30:51.333 --> 30:52.958
When it has gone this far.

30:53.333 --> 30:55.083
I can't be without telling her the truth.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.833
-I'll tell her, dude.
-Hey.

30:56.916 --> 30:57.958
-Gandhi.
-No, dude.

30:58.041 --> 31:00.000
-Don't.
-I have no other choice.

31:00.333 --> 31:01.250
Anu.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.583
We work as a trio in SATS, I mean…

31:04.833 --> 31:07.000
Special Anti-Terrorism Squad.

31:07.083 --> 31:08.958
We take instructions from RAW.

31:09.458 --> 31:11.208
-Actually this department--
-Don't pile up more lies.

31:13.833 --> 31:16.666
You were in Chennai yesterday.
My dad saw you in Nungambakkam.

31:20.958 --> 31:21.916
Nungambakkam.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.208
Nungambakkam!

31:23.541 --> 31:24.375
Continue.

31:26.041 --> 31:30.250
Actually, Anu, did he see me enter
or exit from Shastri Bhavan?

31:31.250 --> 31:34.291
Did he see me enter
or exit from Shastri Bhavan?

31:35.208 --> 31:36.041
I don't know.

31:36.833 --> 31:40.375
God, won't You let me carry out
even a single surprise successfully?

31:41.291 --> 31:43.208
I went to renew our passports, Anu.

31:43.583 --> 31:44.458
Why?

31:44.750 --> 31:45.625
Second honeymoon.

31:46.125 --> 31:47.375
-Thailand.
-Thailand?

31:47.458 --> 31:48.291
The three of us.

31:48.875 --> 31:51.375
Oh! Sorry.
Actually, the four of us.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.041
This was my surprise for you.
But before that,

31:54.125 --> 31:56.333
you are my wife.
That's how you found out.

31:57.333 --> 32:00.791
I swear you are the only one for me
and I can't dream of anyone else.

32:00.875 --> 32:01.875
Work pressure, dear.

32:01.958 --> 32:03.708
That's why. Trust me.

32:03.791 --> 32:04.625
Look at me.

32:05.000 --> 32:05.916
I want to make it up.

32:06.916 --> 32:08.791
This trip is… ours.

32:09.541 --> 32:11.875
Getting perturbed and confused
without any reason.

32:11.958 --> 32:13.416
Don't spoil your health.

32:13.791 --> 32:17.166
My daughter should come out
safe and sound, got it?

32:17.375 --> 32:18.583
Sorry, darling.

32:19.625 --> 32:20.541
Have you lost it?

32:20.916 --> 32:22.833
Will anyone go on a mission
with his family?

32:22.916 --> 32:25.458
-That too, Bangkok with his wife and kids?
-Hey!

32:26.250 --> 32:28.666
She is pregnant and unreasonably upset.

32:29.000 --> 32:29.916
How can I leave her in this state?

32:30.000 --> 32:34.500
It isn't even safe for you.
And that idiot boss is landing there.

32:34.583 --> 32:35.541
How will you handle him?

32:35.625 --> 32:37.000
Who cares about that fool?

32:37.416 --> 32:39.250
I can't handle the "boss" at home!

32:39.458 --> 32:40.333
I don't know, dude.

32:40.750 --> 32:41.750
I have to manage.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.708
Bro, tea or coffee?

32:46.708 --> 32:48.416
No, I'll make you lunch.
You can go only after you eat.

32:49.333 --> 32:50.833
-Oh!
-Oh!

32:52.583 --> 32:58.083
Even if heaven is where we roam
Can it equal home sweet home?

33:12.875 --> 33:14.125
Welcome.

33:34.083 --> 33:37.875
To sit and admire cows and goats
On pastures green, graze, and browse

33:38.166 --> 33:41.916
Nowhere fields can be seen
Now-here in this urban scene

33:42.083 --> 33:45.916
Night and day on a playing spree
Apex game of goat and tiger, carefree

33:46.083 --> 33:50.041
No stone seat under the banyan tree

33:50.125 --> 33:54.041
Harnessing two bulls to a cart duly

33:54.125 --> 33:57.875
No way here to sing along gaily
As we plough the land daily

33:58.083 --> 34:02.000
Calling girls over for chitchat
On a laughing riot over this and that

34:02.083 --> 34:05.958
No such entertainment
Here, just disappointment

34:06.041 --> 34:09.833
This life here lacks magic
Only routine and robotic

34:09.916 --> 34:13.916
Whom can I complain to?
My heartbeat cribs too

34:14.000 --> 34:18.041
Waving its magic wand
No city equals our homeland

34:18.125 --> 34:24.541
Let this be called paradise on earth
But can it replace our place of birth?

34:25.833 --> 34:29.666
Whichever place we visit, wherever

34:29.791 --> 34:32.916
-Can it equal our motherland ever?
-Daddy, color changes to red.

34:33.833 --> 34:36.083
-Can any language spoken world-over
-You're playing the wrong card.

34:36.166 --> 34:42.250
-Ma, Dad is messing up the game.
-Be as honey-sweet as our Tamil ever?

34:45.291 --> 34:46.125
Gandhi.

34:47.041 --> 34:47.958
The mission is on.

34:48.041 --> 34:49.958
Smack that very very good good sound

34:50.125 --> 34:52.041
Grab that, that can be yours now

34:52.125 --> 34:53.916
Move in too hot to speed in now

34:54.000 --> 34:55.958
Free flight flying high
Your time now

34:56.041 --> 34:58.083
Smack that very very
good good sound

34:58.166 --> 35:00.000
Grab that, that can be yours now

35:00.083 --> 35:01.541
Move in too hot to speed in now

35:01.625 --> 35:03.708
Don't drool too much.
Focus on the task at hand.

35:03.791 --> 35:05.750
That girl has the access card.

35:20.125 --> 35:22.000
Smack that very very good good sound

35:22.083 --> 35:24.041
Grab that, that can be yours now

35:24.125 --> 35:26.041
Move in too hot to speed in now

35:26.125 --> 35:28.000
Free flight flying high
Your time now

35:28.083 --> 35:30.083
Smack that very very good good sound

35:30.166 --> 35:32.000
Grab that, that can be yours now

35:32.083 --> 35:34.083
Move in too hot to speed in now

35:34.583 --> 35:36.583
Yes! Connected!

35:41.875 --> 35:43.541
-Where's my card?
-What's happening?

36:02.083 --> 36:03.750
Gandhi, careful.

36:03.875 --> 36:05.333
Security guards have surrounded you.

36:05.875 --> 36:07.791
Do you have any other plans?

36:08.083 --> 36:09.125
Any plan B?

36:09.208 --> 36:11.833
Not just plan B
I have up to plan Z!

36:54.291 --> 36:57.208
Five-star General
Who you know, no comparable

36:59.125 --> 37:01.958
Who wants war?
Now the curse is incurable

37:03.875 --> 37:05.583
Fly through the air like a phoenix

37:05.666 --> 37:06.875
A pinnacle

37:09.625 --> 37:12.041
Greatest of all time
Greatest of mankind

37:17.000 --> 37:17.958
Go

37:19.916 --> 37:21.916
Gandhi, no chance of comparison.

37:22.208 --> 37:23.583
It was an amazing trip.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.583
Jeevan enjoyed it truly, right?

37:26.416 --> 37:27.625
Let our daughter be born.

37:28.250 --> 37:30.291
We will plan our third honeymoon.

37:30.833 --> 37:32.458
It won't be a daughter.
Definitely a boy baby.

37:32.791 --> 37:35.458
How do you say it
so confidently all the time?

37:35.708 --> 37:37.875
Has Radhika told you
after checking the scan?

37:37.958 --> 37:40.541
No, she didn't.
My heart says so.

37:41.083 --> 37:42.958
My heart says it's a girl.

37:43.500 --> 37:44.333
Hey, Jeevan.

37:44.833 --> 37:46.958
What should your sibling be?
Brother or sister?

37:47.041 --> 37:48.875
I want only a baby sister.

37:49.208 --> 37:51.166
Like father like son!

37:54.875 --> 37:57.000
Oh, my God!
I thought as much.

37:57.416 --> 38:00.083
-Let me check.
-Don't go!

38:00.416 --> 38:01.791
-What the hell?
-What happened?

38:01.875 --> 38:03.666
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

38:04.458 --> 38:05.291
No.

38:16.875 --> 38:17.833
Get down.

38:24.333 --> 38:25.208
Oh no!

38:25.291 --> 38:27.083
Down!

38:27.250 --> 38:29.083
Gandhi, who are these men?

38:29.166 --> 38:30.083
I'll tell you, wait.

38:39.375 --> 38:41.333
Spider-Man

38:41.416 --> 38:43.333
Does whatever a spider can

38:55.208 --> 38:57.541
Faster, Dad.

40:11.083 --> 40:12.541
-Don't worry.
-Who are they, Gandhi?

40:23.791 --> 40:25.500
He's over there, let's go.

40:35.791 --> 40:37.500
Eyes on him, follow.

40:49.125 --> 40:50.375
Don't worry. We'll go now.

40:50.458 --> 40:52.625
Look, I can't run anymore.

40:52.708 --> 40:55.333
-They are chasing us, Dad.
-We'll escape.

40:55.416 --> 40:56.541
They are right behind us.

40:56.625 --> 40:57.791
Okay, man. I know.

41:04.416 --> 41:05.833
Gandhi, I can't take another step.

41:06.875 --> 41:07.708
Come on.

41:08.625 --> 41:09.916
-I swear, I can't.
-Come with me.

41:10.208 --> 41:12.041
Come, stay right here.

41:12.166 --> 41:13.583
Okay? I'll be back.

41:14.458 --> 41:16.166
-Where are you going?
-Don't be scared.

41:16.250 --> 41:17.625
-Don't leave me and go.
-Wait here.

41:32.458 --> 41:34.500
Who are you?

41:34.750 --> 41:36.250
Who sent you?
Tell me.

42:15.041 --> 42:16.125
-Ma.
-Gandhi!

42:27.166 --> 42:28.666
What happened?
Do you need help?

42:29.041 --> 42:29.958
My husband…

42:39.666 --> 42:41.250
Hello, help!
Come here!

42:41.333 --> 42:42.208
Gandhi!

42:43.000 --> 42:44.208
Hey! Who are they?

42:44.708 --> 42:45.541
-Tell me.
-I don't know.

42:45.625 --> 42:46.458
Help!

42:47.000 --> 42:49.041
-What-- Oh God! Anu.
-Someone, help!

42:49.333 --> 42:50.625
Go!

43:02.250 --> 43:03.416
Terrific fight, Dad.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.708
-Superb chase.
-Wrong timing!

43:05.875 --> 43:07.750
-Nurse, tell him to go a little faster.
-Sure.

43:07.958 --> 43:09.458
Gandhi, who are these men?

43:10.375 --> 43:12.458
Why should they come and chase us?

43:12.750 --> 43:13.791
How did Kalyan land here?

43:14.333 --> 43:16.500
You claimed it was a holiday
and brought us…

43:18.041 --> 43:19.833
What would I have done
if something had happened to Jeevan?

43:19.916 --> 43:22.375
I am here to handle it.
Nothing bad will happen.

43:23.250 --> 43:26.166
Then is it true you are part of SATS?

43:26.708 --> 43:28.750
-Listen…
-Tell me, Gandhi.

43:28.833 --> 43:30.916
I'll tell you after our baby
is born safe and healthy.

43:32.875 --> 43:35.583
NO RIGHT TURN

43:38.541 --> 43:40.291
-Careful, son.
-I'm asking you, tell me.

43:40.958 --> 43:43.000
Hey, stop.

43:43.083 --> 43:44.166
-Stop!
-What?

43:44.833 --> 43:45.875
Hey, Gandhi.

43:46.458 --> 43:47.875
Even when we were dating each other,

43:47.958 --> 43:50.291
-you were in SATS?
-I'll tell you later, dear.

43:50.375 --> 43:52.833
-First priority is your delivery.
-Gandhi, tell me right now.

43:54.041 --> 43:55.375
Gandhi, I want to know.

43:55.958 --> 43:56.791
Yes, dear.

43:57.458 --> 43:58.666
I was in SATS.

44:00.000 --> 44:00.833
Let's go.

44:01.250 --> 44:02.166
Anu?

44:16.500 --> 44:18.791
Excuse me, sir.
Are you the patient's husband?

44:18.916 --> 44:21.166
Can you just come to the reception?

44:21.291 --> 44:23.500
-You need to sign the consent form.
-Okay.

44:24.416 --> 44:27.500
My legs hurt, Dad.
I'm not coming with you, Dad.

44:27.791 --> 44:28.666
Come.

44:31.916 --> 44:33.458
Don't budge from here, sit tight.

44:40.375 --> 44:42.125
Excuse me.
You need to sign this.

44:47.708 --> 44:48.583
Okay.

45:49.333 --> 45:50.833
Hey! How, Gandhi?

45:51.250 --> 45:53.416
-How did he go missing?
-He was with you, right?

45:54.500 --> 45:56.791
Chief, I made him sit…

45:58.208 --> 46:00.500
-I went to sign the form.
-Okay, calm down.

46:00.583 --> 46:02.083
Have you checked the entire hospital?

46:02.666 --> 46:04.833
I searched. I didn't think anything
bad would happen.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.791
-I can't even understand this language.
-Don't cry, dude.

46:08.875 --> 46:10.458
It will all be fine.

46:11.125 --> 46:14.250
I got this CD from Pattaya Hospital.

46:14.416 --> 46:16.000
It's a surveillance footage.

46:16.083 --> 46:18.250
Can you check the content?

46:25.750 --> 46:27.750
Hey! Who is that lady?

46:30.250 --> 46:31.083
Who is she?

46:33.125 --> 46:34.000
Hey!

46:34.333 --> 46:36.375
Have you seen her
anywhere earlier, Gandhi?

46:40.125 --> 46:42.083
-Number plate.
-Pause. Pause.

46:43.333 --> 46:44.583
Check that. Check the number.

46:44.666 --> 46:45.666
The car…
The van number.

46:47.250 --> 46:48.708
Relax, Gandhi, relax.

46:48.791 --> 46:49.666
He is safe.

46:50.750 --> 46:51.583
Hello?

46:51.708 --> 46:54.125
There has been an accident.
Can you send your team?

46:54.208 --> 46:56.583
Okay, I'll send it right away.

46:58.625 --> 46:59.583
It's an emergency.

47:00.458 --> 47:01.333
Why are we here?

47:01.416 --> 47:03.958
A car with kidnapped children
overturned in an accident.

47:04.208 --> 47:06.416
If possible, we would
like you to verify.

47:06.791 --> 47:08.625
The situation is not good.

47:08.833 --> 47:11.041
Authorities have not finished their job.

47:11.541 --> 47:12.416
Come anyway.

47:12.500 --> 47:13.833
-Excuse me, sir.
-I'll show you the crime scene.

47:13.916 --> 47:16.916
One accident happened here.
His child is missing.

47:23.416 --> 47:25.083
He will be fine. Don't worry.

47:25.416 --> 47:26.291
I'll check.

47:38.208 --> 47:39.333
You can't go.

47:39.416 --> 47:41.833
Excuse me, hello.
Hello. Please!

47:41.916 --> 47:42.833
Sir!

47:42.916 --> 47:45.041
Sir, he's a government officer from India.

47:45.125 --> 47:47.458
He is like a cop.
Just like you.

47:47.541 --> 47:48.583
Like you, please.

47:48.666 --> 47:50.375
-Allow him.
-I will talk to you.

47:53.875 --> 47:54.958
No need to be alarmed, Gandhi.

48:52.125 --> 48:53.333
Oh God!

49:04.666 --> 49:06.041
Jeeva!

49:07.375 --> 49:08.750
Jeeva!

49:09.583 --> 49:10.583
Jeeva!

49:18.541 --> 49:19.750
Jeeva!

49:42.333 --> 49:43.250
Anu.

49:46.958 --> 49:47.916
Gandhi.

49:48.416 --> 49:49.916
Where did you go?

49:51.125 --> 49:52.458
Did you see our baby?

49:56.916 --> 49:58.750
Keeping it a secret from me
for all these years…

49:59.583 --> 50:01.166
How did you have the heart?

50:02.125 --> 50:04.750
I agree with whatever you do, right?

50:05.416 --> 50:06.583
Then why?

50:11.208 --> 50:14.416
We have a daughter
just the way you and Jeevan wished.

50:14.708 --> 50:17.041
At least from now on
don't hide anything from me.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Where is Jeevan?

50:25.041 --> 50:25.958
Gandhi?

50:30.041 --> 50:30.958
Gandhi?

50:32.833 --> 50:34.333
Where's Jeevan, Gandhi?

50:35.916 --> 50:36.916
What happened?

50:38.583 --> 50:39.875
Why are you crying?

50:41.750 --> 50:44.625
I asked where's Jeevan?
Why are you crying for that?

50:46.291 --> 50:47.500
You are scaring me, Gandhi.

50:47.583 --> 50:48.791
Tell me.

50:50.291 --> 50:52.333
-Where is Jeevan?
-Forgive me, dear.

50:52.916 --> 50:54.250
Answer me, Gandhi.

50:54.333 --> 50:55.208
Gandhi, talk to me.

50:55.625 --> 50:56.500
Gandhi.

50:56.583 --> 50:58.333
Where is Jeevan? Tell me!

51:00.291 --> 51:01.833
-Jeevan.
-Gandhi.

51:01.916 --> 51:02.958
Gandhi, tell me.

51:03.041 --> 51:04.041
Where is our son?

51:04.125 --> 51:06.333
Please tell me, Gandhi.

51:06.416 --> 51:10.375
-Passed away, my dear.
-What did you do to our son?

51:10.458 --> 51:11.791
Oh God!

51:13.833 --> 51:14.750
Oh God!

51:15.375 --> 51:16.416
Jeeva.

51:16.500 --> 51:19.166
What did you do to him?

51:19.250 --> 51:21.500
What did you do to my son?

51:21.583 --> 51:22.916
What did you do?

51:23.958 --> 51:25.041
Jeeva.

51:25.208 --> 51:26.333
Jeeva!

51:26.416 --> 51:27.416
My baby!

51:28.833 --> 51:30.166
Jeeva!

51:55.916 --> 51:58.041
What did you do?!

51:58.666 --> 52:00.041
What did you do to him?

52:14.875 --> 52:19.250
TODAY

52:20.916 --> 52:27.333
CHENNAI

52:38.625 --> 52:40.791
Hey! Given a chance
you are letting your tongue run!

52:41.291 --> 52:42.291
Do you know who I am?

52:42.625 --> 52:44.208
Do you know who my sister's husband is?

52:44.666 --> 52:45.500
Do you know which part--

52:46.625 --> 52:48.166
He has warned me not to
use the party's name.

52:48.708 --> 52:50.166
He has announced it only now.

52:50.583 --> 52:51.500
What to do?

52:56.250 --> 52:57.541
-Hello?
-Brother!

52:57.666 --> 53:00.083
When I was on the way to
Pavalar's hotel to attend a meeting,

53:00.166 --> 53:02.791
a policeman snatched my bike key.
He's creating a ruckus, brother.

53:02.875 --> 53:05.583
-Give him a piece of your mind…
-Hey, Cheenu, wait!

53:05.666 --> 53:07.416
-Talk.
-Hello?

53:07.500 --> 53:09.625
-What's your name?
-How does it concern you, sir?

53:09.708 --> 53:11.375
-He's too smart to follow traffic rules?!
-Wrong…

53:11.666 --> 53:14.208
-Tell me your name.
-Sub Inspector Ilavarasu.

53:14.416 --> 53:15.541
-Which station?
-I'll go.

53:15.625 --> 53:17.375
-Push the bike.
-Guindy…

53:17.833 --> 53:19.000
Mr. Ilavarasu.

53:19.416 --> 53:21.041
Take the penalty
due for his offense.

53:21.125 --> 53:23.208
Not even one rupee less.

53:24.208 --> 53:26.208
If I get to know
he escaped your clutches,

53:26.291 --> 53:27.833
I'll file a case against you.

53:28.875 --> 53:31.416
He shouldn't call me
for all this hereafter.

53:31.500 --> 53:33.125
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

53:34.833 --> 53:36.333
Did my brother-in-law
show his power to you?

53:36.416 --> 53:38.166
I'll show you my power now, come.

54:11.791 --> 54:13.875
Mom, Dad is at the door.

54:13.958 --> 54:15.958
I'll be down in five minutes.
Ask him to sit inside.

54:16.250 --> 54:17.750
Okay, dear.
I'll wait for you.

54:19.583 --> 54:22.291
My dad is so stubborn, told him so often
but he will never come in and sit.

54:34.125 --> 54:35.708
I'll pick you up this evening.

54:35.791 --> 54:36.625
-Okay, Ma.
-Bye.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.708
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

54:46.125 --> 54:48.166
Why is Mom picking you up in the evening?

54:48.958 --> 54:51.625
Nothing much, Dad.
Sreenidhi's birthday is coming up, right?

54:51.708 --> 54:53.875
Mom wanted to go shopping.

54:53.958 --> 54:57.000
Are you coming for Sreenidhi's birthday
with me or your mom?

54:57.458 --> 54:59.875
I want to go with both of you.

55:01.916 --> 55:03.458
Why are you adding fuel to the fire?

55:04.583 --> 55:05.541
Sorry.

55:06.125 --> 55:08.000
Actually, even I'm sorry.

55:08.541 --> 55:11.750
I opened your Insta account
and checked your new friends.

55:11.833 --> 55:12.791
Dad!

55:12.916 --> 55:14.500
That's not fair, okay?

55:14.583 --> 55:15.666
It's personal.

55:15.750 --> 55:17.875
My dear daughter, you are just 16.

55:18.125 --> 55:20.125
I have all the rights till you are 18.

55:22.583 --> 55:23.750
Look into that camera.

55:24.375 --> 55:25.750
Can you take off your cap?

55:26.333 --> 55:27.625
How many days are you staying here?

55:29.541 --> 55:30.708
Welcome to India.

55:36.708 --> 55:37.625
Sir?

55:39.250 --> 55:40.666
What brings you to Chennai, sir?

55:41.333 --> 55:43.125
-Sunil's daughter's birthday, right?
-Hi.

55:43.583 --> 55:45.958
That's right.
Jeevitha was telling me, sir.

55:46.541 --> 55:47.791
So, see you there in the evening.

55:47.875 --> 55:48.708
I'll see you, sir.

55:48.791 --> 55:49.875
-The same brand.
-I'll see you.

55:50.166 --> 55:51.166
-Okay.
-Okay.

55:53.125 --> 55:54.083
My boss.

55:55.416 --> 55:56.291
Next.

56:34.708 --> 56:37.041
-Sir, one smoke?
-No, thanks.

56:37.333 --> 56:38.583
-Okay.
-Only "khus-khus"!

56:38.958 --> 56:40.041
-Here.
-Thank you.

56:40.125 --> 56:40.958
Thanks, Cheenu.

56:41.291 --> 56:42.166
Haven't you had dinner?

56:42.333 --> 56:44.041
I've served the cat and him too.

56:44.125 --> 56:45.291
Wait for just five minutes.

56:45.583 --> 56:46.958
Are you taking a dig at my biryani?

56:47.250 --> 56:49.333
Number one biryani in Chepauk Ground,
you know?

56:49.416 --> 56:52.416
Even Dhoni will ask me,
"Cheenu, add an extra leg piece for me."

56:52.500 --> 56:53.791
-Really?
-Yes.

56:53.875 --> 56:56.708
He has an employee in his shop
by the name Dhoni, that's all, sir.

56:57.083 --> 56:57.916
Not our M.S. Dhoni.

56:58.666 --> 57:01.375
Keep mocking! Serves me right
for secretly serving you booze.

57:01.458 --> 57:02.375
It's my fate.

57:02.458 --> 57:04.250
Hello? How do you do, dear?

57:04.333 --> 57:05.333
I'm good, Uncle.

57:05.583 --> 57:07.666
Dad, Mom is leaving.

57:07.916 --> 57:10.583
Sreenidhi asked you to stay
a little longer.

57:10.958 --> 57:14.000
Your mom wants to know
if I can drop you back home.

57:14.333 --> 57:15.166
Am I right?

57:16.083 --> 57:18.250
-Tell her I'll drop you.
-I'll wait inside.

57:23.166 --> 57:24.833
Is Anu still not talking to you?

57:26.208 --> 57:27.958
Gandhi, no one is to blame for this.

57:28.375 --> 57:30.416
How can she be angry with you
for so many years?

57:31.500 --> 57:33.250
Shall I reason with Anu?

57:34.083 --> 57:35.875
This drift isn't because
of her anger, sir.

57:36.375 --> 57:38.541
My son was five when he passed away.

57:39.500 --> 57:42.375
I was unable to take proper care
of my child.

57:43.333 --> 57:45.000
That guiltiness…

57:45.083 --> 57:47.083
This is the punishment
we decided for ourselves.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.958
What stupid logic is this?

57:50.250 --> 57:52.000
Sir. Let him be, sir.

57:52.416 --> 57:53.916
He shows up rarely.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.416
Let's change the topic.

57:55.916 --> 57:57.500
I almost forgot
what I wanted to share.

57:57.750 --> 57:58.625
Hey, dude.

57:59.041 --> 58:01.458
Moscow is reopening
our Indian Embassy.

58:01.708 --> 58:04.416
Our minister spoke out of turn,
and it became a sensitive issue.

58:04.625 --> 58:08.041
The local group is on a war path
against the Embassy being reopened.

58:08.125 --> 58:11.458
Go there for just one week
and train the Immigration officers.

58:11.541 --> 58:13.500
Our Vasu is doing the needful.

58:13.708 --> 58:14.625
Sir.

58:14.916 --> 58:16.750
Vasu is unwell.
That's why I asked him.

58:16.833 --> 58:20.958
Anu agreed to let me be Jeevitha's driver
only because I quit the agency.

58:21.041 --> 58:22.583
-Don't ruin that.
-My dear fellow.

58:22.666 --> 58:24.416
I didn't ask you to
take your gun and shoot.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.250
I'm asking you to do
the same job over there.

58:26.333 --> 58:27.958
Even senior officers
are scared to do this.

58:28.041 --> 58:30.291
Sir, convince him.
He has prior experience.

58:30.375 --> 58:31.958
Anything wrong with what he said?

58:32.041 --> 58:33.958
You refused to take up field work.

58:34.041 --> 58:35.333
Did I object to that?

58:35.416 --> 58:38.291
Then you didn't want any risky job.
Didn't I understand your feelings?

58:38.791 --> 58:42.208
Gandhi, if you vegetate here
don't you need a life for yourself?

58:42.291 --> 58:43.875
My daughter won't let me go, sir.

58:43.958 --> 58:45.291
Your daughter will agree.

58:45.375 --> 58:48.416
You finish the task
and buy her a special gift.

58:48.500 --> 58:51.250
She will be even happier than
you dropping her at school. Am I right?

58:51.333 --> 58:52.625
-Absolutely right, sir
-Brother.

58:52.875 --> 58:55.875
You know the famous Tamil proverb?
Work is worship.

58:55.958 --> 58:56.833
Oh no!

59:15.833 --> 59:18.791
The casual statement made by
our minister was misunderstood, sir.

59:19.250 --> 59:21.541
But the Russian Government
is very supportive.

59:22.750 --> 59:25.750
But the opposition party is trying to use
this situation to their advantage.

59:26.875 --> 59:30.500
Some random small group is protesting
about reopening our Embassy.

59:30.583 --> 59:32.375
Go back!

59:36.666 --> 59:40.041
Our Indian media is also using
the short video clips they get from here.

59:40.541 --> 59:43.625
And magnifying it as if
our Indians are not protected.

59:43.750 --> 59:45.458
You'll be helping the local students here.

59:45.625 --> 59:48.666
It will be good if you can make them
confident with your arrival from India.

59:48.958 --> 59:50.541
And, sir, in a couple of days…

59:50.625 --> 59:53.958
we have planned an event with
Indian origins here and Russian ministers.

1:00:00.708 --> 1:00:03.791
We should just show to the media
that Indians are very safe here, sir.

1:00:04.166 --> 1:00:05.208
That is very important.

1:00:11.708 --> 1:00:13.208
Johnson, what nonsense
is happening here?

1:00:14.500 --> 1:00:16.333
Don't know, sir.
They have been rioting since morning.

1:00:17.958 --> 1:00:19.250
Call the armed forces immediately.

1:00:22.291 --> 1:00:23.333
Move!

1:00:23.416 --> 1:00:24.250
Go!

1:00:30.333 --> 1:00:33.416
You mentioned an event with
Russian ministers and Indian origins.

1:00:33.500 --> 1:00:35.250
-Arrange that immediately.
-Okay, sir.

1:00:35.333 --> 1:00:36.291
We need to sort this out--

1:01:26.125 --> 1:01:27.541
POLICE

1:02:21.125 --> 1:02:23.250
TRUTH ALONE TRIUMPHS

1:02:53.958 --> 1:02:56.041
-Dad, don't come home late hereafter.
-Not a girl, boy for sure.

1:02:56.125 --> 1:02:57.083
Dad, I'm seriously telling you.

1:02:57.166 --> 1:03:00.083
You swore when I was expecting Jeevan.
Now you promise on our second son too.

1:03:00.166 --> 1:03:03.916
-Terrific fight, Dad, Superb chase.
-Like father like son!

1:03:15.625 --> 1:03:16.500
Hey, Gandhi.

1:03:17.750 --> 1:03:19.833
-Why won't you pick up my calls?
-Hey…

1:03:19.916 --> 1:03:21.416
As soon as I heard about the attack
on the Indian Embassy,

1:03:21.875 --> 1:03:24.458
I tried so hard to reach you.
No response from you.

1:03:24.958 --> 1:03:26.250
That's why I flew right away.

1:03:30.125 --> 1:03:31.000
Gandhi.

1:03:31.875 --> 1:03:32.708
Are you okay?

1:03:33.500 --> 1:03:34.333
What's up?

1:03:35.333 --> 1:03:37.708
In the gang that attacked the Embassy…

1:03:41.916 --> 1:03:44.000
an exact copy of me…

1:03:45.458 --> 1:03:46.625
I saw a boy, dude.

1:03:48.541 --> 1:03:49.416
What are you saying?

1:03:51.916 --> 1:03:53.208
My son.

1:03:54.333 --> 1:03:55.250
Jeevan.

1:03:56.041 --> 1:03:58.166
-If alive today…
-Hey! Gandhi.

1:03:58.875 --> 1:04:00.166
Jeevan is dead, dude.

1:04:01.458 --> 1:04:02.958
I know.

1:04:03.208 --> 1:04:04.083
I know.

1:04:05.625 --> 1:04:06.500
But…

1:04:09.208 --> 1:04:11.458
Just inches from me…

1:04:12.541 --> 1:04:13.416
Buddy.

1:04:14.125 --> 1:04:17.375
It all happened within
a fraction of a second but…

1:04:18.583 --> 1:04:20.041
His gaze.

1:04:21.291 --> 1:04:22.250
Those eyes.

1:04:24.333 --> 1:04:25.208
Hey!

1:04:26.416 --> 1:04:28.041
I believe you, dude.

1:04:30.583 --> 1:04:33.583
Something is amiss, I feel
maybe I did something wrong.

1:04:33.916 --> 1:04:34.791
Look at me.

1:04:35.625 --> 1:04:36.666
You have this doubt, right?

1:04:37.250 --> 1:04:38.958
I'll trace that gang tomorrow.

1:04:39.083 --> 1:04:40.125
I'll bring that boy to you.

1:04:41.250 --> 1:04:42.416
Then you'll get all the answers.

1:04:44.708 --> 1:04:45.583
Until then,

1:04:46.541 --> 1:04:48.375
don't overthink and
worry too much, okay?

1:05:17.166 --> 1:05:18.000
Get in, sir.

1:05:19.375 --> 1:05:21.041
-You go, sir. I'll come later.
-Okay, sir.

1:05:51.416 --> 1:05:52.500
Jeevan?

1:06:17.083 --> 1:06:18.208
You are my dad, right?

1:06:41.250 --> 1:06:42.583
Jeevan.

1:06:44.208 --> 1:06:45.125
Jeevan.

1:06:45.541 --> 1:06:46.375
My son!

1:06:47.250 --> 1:06:50.041
I thought you had passed away.

1:06:52.250 --> 1:06:53.875
Sorry, dear.

1:06:53.958 --> 1:06:55.041
Sorry, dear.

1:06:55.250 --> 1:06:57.458
Hey! I am so sorry.

1:07:04.625 --> 1:07:05.500
My son.

1:07:08.125 --> 1:07:10.416
From the day you disappeared,

1:07:12.916 --> 1:07:17.833
I have thought of 1000 different ways
of how I could have saved you.

1:07:20.250 --> 1:07:22.833
But to think you'll be alive.

1:07:25.250 --> 1:07:27.875
I didn't imagine that option even once.

1:07:30.750 --> 1:07:31.625
Jeevan.

1:07:32.291 --> 1:07:33.125
Hey!

1:07:34.500 --> 1:07:36.708
How are you here?

1:07:39.291 --> 1:07:40.500
I was in many different places.

1:07:42.375 --> 1:07:43.250
Now I am here.

1:07:44.166 --> 1:07:45.000
Son.

1:07:45.958 --> 1:07:47.166
Didn't you wish to meet me?

1:07:47.750 --> 1:07:50.291
You could have come
looking for me, for your dad?

1:07:51.291 --> 1:07:53.500
I don't remember many things, Dad.

1:07:54.750 --> 1:07:56.208
I was wondering about…

1:07:57.666 --> 1:07:58.541
Yesterday,

1:07:59.083 --> 1:08:00.916
when I saw you in the Embassy…

1:08:02.291 --> 1:08:03.958
The face I see often in my dreams.

1:08:05.875 --> 1:08:07.833
You looked so familiar.

1:08:11.416 --> 1:08:12.458
Even now,

1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:16.875
I can't even believe this.

1:08:17.250 --> 1:08:18.375
I'm standing in front of my dad.

1:08:20.541 --> 1:08:23.791
Your dad will never go anywhere
leaving you behind.

1:08:26.125 --> 1:08:26.958
No, Dad.

1:08:28.333 --> 1:08:29.250
You're in danger.

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.291
That's why.

1:08:33.083 --> 1:08:34.625
I'm talking to you alone here.

1:08:35.166 --> 1:08:36.041
Faisal gang.

1:08:36.625 --> 1:08:38.791
Before they try to attack you,

1:08:40.375 --> 1:08:41.250
you must leave…

1:08:41.958 --> 1:08:43.041
this country at the earliest.

1:08:44.375 --> 1:08:45.208
Then come with me.

1:08:45.875 --> 1:08:47.375
Let's leave right now.
Come with me.

1:08:48.041 --> 1:08:48.916
No, Dad.

1:08:49.583 --> 1:08:52.666
First, you leave this country
and get home safely.

1:08:53.333 --> 1:08:55.125
Trying to take me with you.

1:08:55.416 --> 1:08:56.416
Impossible.

1:08:56.916 --> 1:08:57.791
Why?

1:08:58.500 --> 1:09:00.458
I'm seeing you after so many years.

1:09:00.750 --> 1:09:02.416
You think I'll leave you behind?

1:09:02.666 --> 1:09:05.541
You have no clue
about the Faisal gang.

1:09:05.875 --> 1:09:07.291
They are extremely dangerous.

1:09:09.125 --> 1:09:11.333
You don't know your dad's true colors!

1:09:12.333 --> 1:09:14.208
Without you, forget this country,

1:09:14.958 --> 1:09:17.000
I won't move a millimeter from this spot.

1:09:18.666 --> 1:09:19.708
Oh, shit.

1:09:20.125 --> 1:09:21.250
Dad, you're okay?

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:22.833
You okay?

1:09:23.708 --> 1:09:24.625
Go!

1:09:25.166 --> 1:09:26.583
Dad, run. Come with me.

1:09:34.375 --> 1:09:35.250
Shit.

1:09:36.500 --> 1:09:37.375
Damn!

1:09:37.666 --> 1:09:38.541
Hey!

1:09:38.875 --> 1:09:40.750
-They are getting away.
-Follow.

1:09:40.833 --> 1:09:41.791
Catch them. I'm coming.

1:09:59.500 --> 1:10:00.333
Come on.

1:10:04.666 --> 1:10:05.666
Over there.

1:10:10.541 --> 1:10:11.375
Dad, let's go!

1:10:12.083 --> 1:10:12.958
Wait.

1:10:41.458 --> 1:10:42.333
Go!

1:11:14.375 --> 1:11:16.000
-Gandhi.
-Tell me.

1:11:16.208 --> 1:11:17.458
Hey! Bingo!
I got it.

1:11:17.875 --> 1:11:18.708
What?

1:11:18.791 --> 1:11:20.625
The local gang led by Faisal
attacked the Embassy.

1:11:20.958 --> 1:11:22.500
I have tracked their hide-out.

1:11:22.750 --> 1:11:24.625
We can get our boy
if we go there now.

1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.083
I got my boy back
half an hour ago, dude.

1:11:27.166 --> 1:11:28.708
Just do as I say.

1:12:04.333 --> 1:12:06.000
-Tell me.
-I'm in the lane you specified.

1:12:06.083 --> 1:12:07.833
-Where are you?
-Mr. Gandhi.

1:12:08.208 --> 1:12:09.458
Look to your right.

1:12:09.958 --> 1:12:11.041
White truck.

1:12:27.166 --> 1:12:28.000
My dear buddy.

1:12:28.625 --> 1:12:29.583
Shall we go back to India?

1:12:47.125 --> 1:12:48.000
Hi, Ma.

1:13:01.166 --> 1:13:02.041
Jeevan.

1:13:22.375 --> 1:13:23.208
Jeevan.

1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.791
Young eyes sparkle
Smiles encore

1:13:38.125 --> 1:13:41.083
My womb feels fragrant once more

1:13:41.166 --> 1:13:44.083
Grey skies afar now in blue brilliance

1:13:44.458 --> 1:13:47.541
Heart submerged in a gale of gladness

1:13:47.625 --> 1:13:50.250
My prince forever

1:13:50.333 --> 1:13:52.291
No separation hereafter

1:13:52.375 --> 1:13:53.916
To retrieve your belongings

1:13:56.625 --> 1:14:00.291
You are a part of me, my tender flower

1:14:00.625 --> 1:14:06.250
Let us bond in unity
Honeyed vision for eternity

1:14:06.916 --> 1:14:13.083
Let darkness scatter into oblivion
Let stars bloom in our bird nest hereon

1:14:13.250 --> 1:14:19.000
Like the most unexpected treasure
You sparkle in our trove now for sure

1:14:19.583 --> 1:14:25.416
My heart sparkles with joy limitless
Even your mustache, like a baby lisps

1:14:25.500 --> 1:14:28.333
Young eyes sparkle
Smiles encore

1:14:28.625 --> 1:14:31.458
Family shrine is scented once more

1:14:31.833 --> 1:14:34.583
Grey skies afar now in blue brilliance

1:14:34.958 --> 1:14:38.208
Heart submerged in a gale of gladness

1:15:03.625 --> 1:15:09.750
The second day of the monsoon shower
Pristine pure are the drops thereafter

1:15:10.041 --> 1:15:16.000
This is a kind of second birth for you
Now we can lead a contented life anew

1:15:16.291 --> 1:15:22.291
In the battlefield where wars are waged
Biggest strength is the blood bond forged

1:15:22.625 --> 1:15:28.625
Come on, stand up, swirl your weapon
Pierce the skies, nothing to fear, son

1:15:28.708 --> 1:15:34.583
Like a long-suffering, silent parakeet
That's forgotten how to chirp sweet

1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:41.416
When our hearts drowned in misery
You waltzed in as our lilting melody

1:15:41.708 --> 1:15:47.708
Let us bond in unity
Honeyed vision for eternity

1:15:48.041 --> 1:15:54.666
Let darkness scatter into oblivion
Let stars bloom in our bird nest hereon

1:16:19.791 --> 1:16:25.958
My soul friend, as soon as I saw you
Down memory lane I walked through

1:16:26.125 --> 1:16:31.416
Recalling the scent of your plaits two
Is this you? Is all this true?

1:16:32.208 --> 1:16:35.083
First love is always so divine

1:16:35.458 --> 1:16:38.541
Wordless sublime sunshine

1:16:38.625 --> 1:16:42.708
A drizzle without witness here
Is this you?

1:16:42.791 --> 1:16:43.875
Is it true, my dear?

1:16:43.958 --> 1:16:50.541
Into this innocent heart of mine
You breezed in like a feather sublime

1:16:50.750 --> 1:16:57.000
Though childhood and time sped fast
You waited for me, patient and steadfast

1:16:57.083 --> 1:16:58.666
Let us time-travel now

1:16:59.833 --> 1:17:03.250
Retrace our past years, my love

1:17:03.333 --> 1:17:04.958
Revisit life and how

1:17:06.041 --> 1:17:10.083
Rewind as children embracing love

1:17:15.291 --> 1:17:19.083
Today is not like yesterday

1:17:19.666 --> 1:17:23.291
Today is not the same as the next day

1:17:23.916 --> 1:17:29.250
In a heart with love overflowing

1:17:30.875 --> 1:17:32.250
We aren't qualified to sing at all!

1:17:36.083 --> 1:17:37.166
Why this murderous spree?

1:17:38.750 --> 1:17:40.000
Thank God SPB is not alive.

1:17:40.625 --> 1:17:41.916
His ears would have bled to death.

1:17:42.416 --> 1:17:45.458
Brother, don't I sing
better than SPB's son Charan?

1:17:46.416 --> 1:17:47.833
How do-- Okay.

1:17:51.375 --> 1:17:54.041
You can't even imagine,
to that extent…

1:17:55.500 --> 1:17:56.625
I am happy

1:17:57.208 --> 1:18:01.333
Shall I share all my feelings completely?

1:18:01.416 --> 1:18:02.625
Wow! Bravo!

1:18:03.500 --> 1:18:09.541
She lit the lamp of love in my heart

1:18:10.458 --> 1:18:14.291
One who stripped my life of everything.

1:18:14.833 --> 1:18:16.833
He himself stood right
in front of my eyes

1:18:17.375 --> 1:18:19.083
and returned everything…
more than 100%, dude.

1:18:20.500 --> 1:18:22.333
Brother, life is a circle.

1:18:22.833 --> 1:18:25.375
The winner will lose.
The loser will win.

1:18:25.958 --> 1:18:26.833
Can't stand your throwbacks!

1:18:27.875 --> 1:18:29.166
Cheers to our Jeevan.

1:18:31.458 --> 1:18:32.666
-Cheers!
-Yes, cheers!

1:18:34.916 --> 1:18:38.708
If you get a little tipsy
and throw up weird dialogues like that.

1:18:39.708 --> 1:18:44.000
If we don't react to any negative
towards us,

1:18:44.083 --> 1:18:45.250
our life will be ultimate!

1:18:45.333 --> 1:18:46.250
Oh no!

1:18:51.500 --> 1:18:52.875
-Sir?
-Gandhi?

1:18:53.416 --> 1:18:54.291
Where are you?

1:18:55.041 --> 1:18:56.125
Third round, sir!

1:18:56.541 --> 1:18:58.666
I'm here at the Chennai airport.

1:18:58.750 --> 1:19:00.208
I have to meet you immediately.

1:19:00.458 --> 1:19:02.708
Our usual place.
Hotel Maris, bar.

1:19:02.916 --> 1:19:03.750
Come soon.

1:19:04.041 --> 1:19:04.875
What's the matter, sir?

1:19:05.208 --> 1:19:06.541
I can't tell you over the phone.

1:19:06.791 --> 1:19:08.291
I'll tell you in person.
Come soon.

1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:35.875
Hey!

1:19:36.375 --> 1:19:38.125
Hey, no! Move!

1:19:39.708 --> 1:19:41.083
Hey! Passengers.
Get out of the way.

1:20:18.500 --> 1:20:20.208
Gandhi, where are you?

1:20:20.666 --> 1:20:21.666
Gandhi, can you hear me?

1:20:21.750 --> 1:20:22.666
I'm on my way, sir.

1:20:31.708 --> 1:20:33.000
Sir?

1:20:34.208 --> 1:20:37.125
The next train to Chennai airport

1:20:37.208 --> 1:20:39.750
has arrived on platform number two.

1:20:39.833 --> 1:20:42.291
The next train to Chennai airport.

1:20:46.875 --> 1:20:49.291
Next train to Chennai airport

1:20:49.375 --> 1:20:52.000
has arrived on platform number two.

1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:27.333
Thalapathy!

1:25:40.291 --> 1:25:42.041
Gandhi!

1:25:43.333 --> 1:25:44.375
Chase him.

1:25:46.291 --> 1:25:47.958
Go!

1:26:19.708 --> 1:26:21.375
You're talking to a real G.O.A.T

1:26:21.625 --> 1:26:23.875
The V-I-J-A-Y

1:26:23.958 --> 1:26:25.416
Youngblood with guts and grit

1:26:27.541 --> 1:26:28.916
Young general, firm and fit

1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.083
The V-I-J-A-Y

1:26:31.166 --> 1:26:32.750
A gene to inherit

1:26:34.500 --> 1:26:36.500
Commander, people's favorite

1:26:51.125 --> 1:26:52.125
GOAT!

1:26:58.541 --> 1:26:59.541
GOAT!

1:28:13.750 --> 1:28:14.625
Boys.

1:28:14.833 --> 1:28:16.166
Sorry for your loss.

1:28:17.125 --> 1:28:18.583
He was such a fine fellow.

1:28:19.833 --> 1:28:21.958
It's really a big loss for our SATS.

1:28:25.416 --> 1:28:27.333
Before Nazeer landed in Chennai,

1:28:27.625 --> 1:28:29.000
from his official computer,

1:28:29.083 --> 1:28:31.625
he transferred some data
to his personal phone.

1:28:32.166 --> 1:28:34.583
I have even sent you
that CCTV footage.

1:28:34.833 --> 1:28:37.416
But the system was checked.

1:28:37.500 --> 1:28:38.916
It is completely corrupted.

1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:40.500
It is very confusing, sir.

1:28:40.875 --> 1:28:44.291
What is that important data?
Why did he want to show it to Gandhi?

1:28:44.708 --> 1:28:46.583
All the dots are confusing, sir.

1:28:47.625 --> 1:28:49.208
When I spoke to him over the phone,

1:28:49.291 --> 1:28:52.958
I sensed an urgency in his voice
of wanting to share a secret with me.

1:28:54.208 --> 1:28:57.083
This attack was to prevent me
from meeting him.

1:28:58.083 --> 1:28:59.916
Did you get Nazeer's phone?

1:29:00.041 --> 1:29:01.416
Sir, his phone has been switched off.

1:29:01.583 --> 1:29:03.041
Our team is tracking it, sir.

1:29:03.666 --> 1:29:07.291
He made me run after him, killed him
in front of my eyes, and he escaped.

1:29:08.416 --> 1:29:11.250
That scene is replaying
in my mind repeatedly, sir.

1:29:13.583 --> 1:29:16.375
I have lost to a masked man.

1:29:17.208 --> 1:29:20.833
I am unable to sleep even a single night
peacefully because of that failure.

1:29:21.375 --> 1:29:23.083
Whoever the killer may be,

1:29:23.708 --> 1:29:25.958
I'll hunt him down with my own hands.

1:29:28.958 --> 1:29:30.291
I have to kill him, sir.

1:29:32.041 --> 1:29:33.291
I've made up my mind, sir.

1:29:34.250 --> 1:29:35.708
I'm coming back to the squad.

1:29:39.083 --> 1:29:39.958
What, sir?

1:29:40.625 --> 1:29:41.791
"He's old now.

1:29:42.541 --> 1:29:44.583
Many years since he left the squad.

1:29:44.916 --> 1:29:46.291
How will he manage?"
Is this what you're thinking?

1:29:48.041 --> 1:29:49.541
Age is just a number, right?

1:29:50.250 --> 1:29:51.875
A lion is always a lion.

1:29:54.291 --> 1:29:55.208
Forests can change.

1:29:55.916 --> 1:29:58.833
But its hunting instincts
will never change.

1:30:00.833 --> 1:30:02.791
Get back into the squad.
I'll take care of it.

1:30:02.958 --> 1:30:03.833
Thank you, sir.

1:30:04.708 --> 1:30:06.250
I'm waiting.

1:30:06.625 --> 1:30:09.291
Five-star General
Who you know, no comparable

1:30:11.333 --> 1:30:14.000
Who wants war
Now the curse is incurable

1:30:14.083 --> 1:30:15.041
TIRUVALLIKENI

1:30:16.083 --> 1:30:17.791
Fly through the air like a phoenix

1:30:17.875 --> 1:30:18.875
A pinnacle

1:30:21.875 --> 1:30:24.333
Greatest of all time
Greatest of mankind

1:30:26.541 --> 1:30:28.416
Sir, this isn't the only time
Nazeer sir was here.

1:30:28.500 --> 1:30:30.291
He landed in Chennai
on the seventh of last month too.

1:30:30.791 --> 1:30:33.291
But he didn't inform
his family or SATS, sir.

1:30:33.375 --> 1:30:35.541
He was staying in Hotel Maris.

1:30:35.625 --> 1:30:37.125
That's the CCTV footage.

1:30:37.208 --> 1:30:40.250
But we didn't know why he came
or whom he met during that visit, sir.

1:30:40.333 --> 1:30:42.125
Where is the phone you picked up
at the metro station?

1:30:42.708 --> 1:30:43.583
That phone…

1:30:44.041 --> 1:30:45.833
Somehow that phone is missing.

1:30:46.125 --> 1:30:47.916
But I don't know where.

1:30:49.750 --> 1:30:51.166
-That phone is very important
-Yes, sir.

1:30:51.250 --> 1:30:52.416
Find that first.

1:30:52.500 --> 1:30:54.708
If by some fluke he gets that phone,

1:30:56.291 --> 1:30:57.583
our entire plan

1:30:57.958 --> 1:30:59.375
goes down the drain!

1:30:59.583 --> 1:31:02.166
You checked Nazeer's gadgets.
Any leads?

1:31:02.500 --> 1:31:03.916
Sir, I couldn't take any data.

1:31:04.125 --> 1:31:06.333
His system, gadgets… are corrupted.

1:31:06.500 --> 1:31:08.541
He followed us, dude.

1:31:08.625 --> 1:31:11.791
So well-informed
of all our moves and plans.

1:31:12.750 --> 1:31:15.083
He collected all the data
and came to meet Gandhi.

1:31:15.541 --> 1:31:17.916
There was a chap on a bike.
Details of that bike?

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:19.541
Sir, that's an assembled bike.

1:31:21.750 --> 1:31:23.833
Sanjay, don't overthink.

1:31:23.958 --> 1:31:25.375
That phone is switched off
since this morning.

1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:26.541
I'm tracking it.

1:31:26.625 --> 1:31:28.166
-Somehow-
-You are at it?

1:31:35.916 --> 1:31:36.750
Dad?

1:31:44.458 --> 1:31:45.666
Hello, Sanjay.

1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:47.416
All well?

1:31:49.458 --> 1:31:50.333
Superb, Dad.

1:31:51.125 --> 1:31:51.958
No complaints.

1:31:52.166 --> 1:31:53.625
Smooth sailing as per the plan.

1:32:07.041 --> 1:32:07.875
Tell me, dear.

1:32:08.458 --> 1:32:10.416
How long will we be
on the run like this?

1:32:10.916 --> 1:32:13.250
I am so scared
when I think of their future.

1:32:13.375 --> 1:32:14.916
Abi, don't be so flustered.

1:32:15.541 --> 1:32:17.333
I'm doing all this
only for our well-being.

1:32:27.500 --> 1:32:29.041
No, stop.

1:32:29.125 --> 1:32:31.041
-Abi!
-Dad!

1:32:31.125 --> 1:32:33.375
Swetha! Sanjay!

1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:50.166
Swetha?

1:32:51.541 --> 1:32:53.041
Swetha? Sanjay?

1:32:53.125 --> 1:32:54.291
What is this?

1:32:57.750 --> 1:32:59.625
Abi! Oh no!

1:32:59.708 --> 1:33:00.541
Abi?

1:33:01.375 --> 1:33:02.875
Abi, I can't believe this.

1:33:02.958 --> 1:33:03.875
Abi.

1:33:04.750 --> 1:33:05.833
My children…

1:33:08.625 --> 1:33:10.208
Abi!

1:34:25.833 --> 1:34:27.083
Instill fear in him.

1:34:27.791 --> 1:34:29.333
Instill only fear.

1:34:30.083 --> 1:34:32.500
He should remember
only this fear from now on.

1:34:33.708 --> 1:34:39.416
Though my tiny hands were eager to embrace
A hand to clasp missing nowadays

1:34:39.666 --> 1:34:45.458
Though my eyes can see well
This sight is more painful than hell

1:34:45.625 --> 1:34:51.458
Won't my mother's yearning lead her
To rescue me from this torture?

1:34:51.625 --> 1:34:57.375
Won't my dad lock his hands to comfort
My trembling fingers in support?

1:34:57.666 --> 1:35:03.458
Though my tiny hands were eager to embrace
A hand to clasp missing nowadays

1:35:03.666 --> 1:35:08.875
Though my eyes can see well
This sight is more painful than hell

1:35:08.958 --> 1:35:10.625
Mom!

1:35:18.750 --> 1:35:19.791
Oh no!

1:35:30.708 --> 1:35:36.333
A dawn will brighten skies from sorrow
A refreshing breeze will caress tomorrow

1:35:36.708 --> 1:35:39.583
O' waning moon fading daily

1:35:39.666 --> 1:35:42.541
Pacify, till you wax again duly

1:35:42.625 --> 1:35:48.500
Only when clouds split open
Rains shower in gay abandon

1:35:48.666 --> 1:35:54.500
When distress fades into the horizon
In smiling eyes tears of joy will glisten

1:35:54.625 --> 1:35:56.750
-Happy times will soon dawn
-Tell me this.

1:35:57.333 --> 1:35:58.208
Your name.

1:35:58.416 --> 1:35:59.541
Your parents.

1:35:59.750 --> 1:36:00.750
The place you were born.

1:36:00.833 --> 1:36:02.666
Don't you remember anything?

1:36:03.666 --> 1:36:07.333
Pacify, till you wax again duly

1:36:11.791 --> 1:36:13.541
I am your dad.

1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:16.916
Your name.

1:36:17.458 --> 1:36:18.500
Sanjay.

1:36:20.125 --> 1:36:21.708
Sanjay.

1:36:47.041 --> 1:36:48.416
Where is Menon?

1:36:49.583 --> 1:36:51.166
Is he hiding or what?

1:36:51.458 --> 1:36:52.458
From now on.

1:36:53.166 --> 1:36:54.583
My father won't be available.

1:36:55.500 --> 1:36:56.458
It's me, his son,

1:36:57.375 --> 1:36:58.291
who will do the talking.

1:37:14.416 --> 1:37:15.291
Dad.

1:37:17.458 --> 1:37:18.583
What are you doing, Dad?

1:37:20.250 --> 1:37:21.208
Tell me, Dad.

1:37:22.958 --> 1:37:24.125
Our family…

1:37:24.541 --> 1:37:27.166
Right in front of my eyes…

1:37:28.625 --> 1:37:30.583
Today, I found out who was the murderer.

1:37:32.041 --> 1:37:32.958
Superb!

1:37:33.916 --> 1:37:36.333
Instead of killing him
why are you pointing a gun to your head?

1:37:38.750 --> 1:37:39.666
Look at me.

1:37:40.041 --> 1:37:41.208
If you can't, tell me.

1:37:42.375 --> 1:37:43.291
I'll do it.

1:37:43.583 --> 1:37:44.458
No need, son.

1:37:44.625 --> 1:37:46.791
I don't want you to commit that sin.

1:37:46.958 --> 1:37:48.125
What is sinful?

1:37:48.750 --> 1:37:50.916
Is it a sin to seek revenge
on the one who destroyed our family?

1:37:51.625 --> 1:37:54.666
Isn't it a sin for the son
to kill his own father?

1:37:56.625 --> 1:37:57.708
What?

1:37:57.791 --> 1:37:59.708
The man who burned our family to ashes.

1:38:00.333 --> 1:38:02.333
The one who drove me out of my country.

1:38:02.583 --> 1:38:07.291
And made me roam from
place to place as a refugee.

1:38:07.750 --> 1:38:09.375
He is none other than…

1:38:11.416 --> 1:38:12.291
Gandhi.

1:38:13.250 --> 1:38:15.166
Your biological father.

1:38:24.958 --> 1:38:25.916
Look at the hand of fate!

1:38:27.333 --> 1:38:28.791
It has brought me to this state.

1:38:29.125 --> 1:38:32.875
I adopted a boy to take revenge
on the man who killed my family.

1:38:33.291 --> 1:38:34.208
But,

1:38:34.583 --> 1:38:37.416
when I found out
that boy is his own son…

1:38:38.250 --> 1:38:39.458
Other than killing myself,

1:38:39.875 --> 1:38:41.041
I had no other option.

1:38:42.208 --> 1:38:44.791
Even now I could have hidden
this information from you.

1:38:44.875 --> 1:38:46.833
Used you as bait and killed him.

1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:48.375
But my conscience didn't allow it.

1:38:48.458 --> 1:38:51.416
Sanjay, it's okay.
Forget our plan.

1:38:51.500 --> 1:38:53.416
-Only you matter to me, Sanjay.
-Dad!

1:38:54.250 --> 1:38:55.333
Think again!

1:38:55.875 --> 1:38:58.375
I was wondering how I could kill him.

1:38:58.583 --> 1:39:00.000
No, Sanjay.

1:39:00.083 --> 1:39:01.666
-It's not fair.
-What is fair?

1:39:02.458 --> 1:39:03.708
Tell me what's not fair?

1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:04.833
Losing my memory.

1:39:04.916 --> 1:39:07.291
I was begging on the streets.
You picked me up and gave me life.

1:39:08.500 --> 1:39:09.583
Not him.

1:39:10.500 --> 1:39:12.166
I can't even imagine

1:39:12.416 --> 1:39:13.708
how traumatized I would've been.

1:39:15.083 --> 1:39:17.041
Dad, I don't even know his face.

1:39:18.458 --> 1:39:19.583
You are the only dad to me.

1:39:19.708 --> 1:39:20.666
I am your son.

1:39:21.083 --> 1:39:22.916
That's how I see it,
and I will continue to do so.

1:39:26.833 --> 1:39:29.333
Gandhi destroyed your family
and reduced you to this state.

1:39:30.291 --> 1:39:32.291
He has to experience everything
you went through.

1:39:33.166 --> 1:39:35.125
He can't die so easily.

1:39:36.208 --> 1:39:37.458
Sanjay.

1:39:42.625 --> 1:39:43.666
My son.

1:39:44.666 --> 1:39:46.875
How is our Gandhi?

1:39:47.250 --> 1:39:48.125
Dad!

1:39:48.458 --> 1:39:49.916
Showering tender love and care on me.

1:39:51.250 --> 1:39:54.000
Love!

1:39:54.250 --> 1:39:55.500
Only love.

1:39:57.666 --> 1:39:58.500
Sickening!

1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:01.791
I killed their boss Nazeer, right?

1:40:02.125 --> 1:40:04.000
He returned to his squad
just as we thought.

1:40:04.083 --> 1:40:05.583
You take it easy, Dad.

1:40:06.166 --> 1:40:08.541
We will tick our wish list
using him as bait.

1:40:08.625 --> 1:40:11.250
Sanjay, you should be very careful.

1:40:11.625 --> 1:40:14.916
He shouldn't have any doubts
till our mission is completed.

1:40:15.833 --> 1:40:18.666
Sister, it's been ages since I had
such delicious home-cooked food.

1:40:18.916 --> 1:40:21.291
As if girls nowadays enter the kitchen?

1:40:21.375 --> 1:40:23.250
-Only online orders.
-Started again?

1:40:23.333 --> 1:40:25.166
-Learn from her.
-Okay, sir.

1:40:26.458 --> 1:40:27.375
Yes, Ajay.

1:40:27.541 --> 1:40:29.250
Nazeer sir's phone is switched on now.

1:40:29.625 --> 1:40:31.291
Nazeer's phone is switched on?

1:40:31.541 --> 1:40:33.458
-Which location?
-Signal from the tower in Mount Road.

1:40:33.958 --> 1:40:35.125
Exact location?

1:40:35.541 --> 1:40:37.541
Our location hider
is installed on his phone.

1:40:37.750 --> 1:40:39.916
So we have deactivated it via remote
and we are tracking it now.

1:40:40.208 --> 1:40:41.625
Okay, keep tracking.

1:40:52.708 --> 1:40:55.333
I have no father to boost me up further

1:40:55.416 --> 1:40:58.041
No love from mother to rest
My head on her lap ever

1:40:58.125 --> 1:41:01.958
I climbed by myself the mountain summit
Why are you bothered by it?

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:04.833
Gandhi?

1:41:09.500 --> 1:41:11.000
-Hello?
-Hello?

1:41:11.333 --> 1:41:13.625
I am Gandhi speaking.

1:41:13.791 --> 1:41:14.625
Tell me, Father.

1:41:15.875 --> 1:41:16.791
Who are you, sir?

1:41:18.125 --> 1:41:19.750
My name, Father…

1:41:21.083 --> 1:41:22.875
Oh no! Director of Goa,
Venkat Prabhu.

1:41:22.958 --> 1:41:24.000
I'll get caught if I use any VIP name.

1:41:24.416 --> 1:41:26.500
I am Thirrupathi Brother…

1:41:26.791 --> 1:41:27.916
Thirrupathi Brothers?

1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:29.208
No, Father.

1:41:29.291 --> 1:41:30.208
Well…

1:41:30.541 --> 1:41:32.208
Yes! My name is Bose.

1:41:32.625 --> 1:41:33.750
Subash Chandra Bose.

1:41:33.958 --> 1:41:35.541
Subash Chandra Bose?

1:41:35.625 --> 1:41:39.166
My dear man, if you can be Gandhi,
why can't I be Subash Chandra Bose?

1:41:39.666 --> 1:41:41.416
-Okay, Bose sir.
-Yes, Gandhi?

1:41:41.500 --> 1:41:43.583
That phone belongs to my friend.

1:41:43.666 --> 1:41:44.875
He lost it.

1:41:45.291 --> 1:41:46.416
Yo! Daddy.

1:41:46.583 --> 1:41:47.458
Lost it?

1:41:48.083 --> 1:41:51.166
Trying to pickpocket this mobile from
that chap in the elbow-to-elbow crowd,

1:41:51.250 --> 1:41:52.666
my backbone broke.

1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:54.708
Oh! Are you a mobile thief?

1:41:54.791 --> 1:41:57.083
Hey! What?
All you want is this mobile?

1:41:57.375 --> 1:41:58.625
Come with 50,000 rupees.

1:41:58.708 --> 1:42:00.500
Meet me in person.
Pay and take the mobile.

1:42:00.708 --> 1:42:02.958
I'll come with the money right now.
Tell me your location.

1:42:03.041 --> 1:42:05.083
Daddy, you might be smarter than me.

1:42:05.166 --> 1:42:06.458
But in this matter,
I am the smart cookie!

1:42:06.583 --> 1:42:08.416
Won't I get caught
if I reveal my location?

1:42:08.666 --> 1:42:10.708
Will you come to the location I specify?

1:42:10.833 --> 1:42:12.208
-Where should I come?
-Quick question.

1:42:12.291 --> 1:42:13.708
Guindy, Kathipara?

1:42:16.250 --> 1:42:18.416
Daddy, do you know
"Gandhi Mandapam"?

1:42:18.500 --> 1:42:20.166
Come over there.
We'll finish it in a jiffy.

1:42:20.291 --> 1:42:21.666
Okay, Bose sir.
I'll be there.

1:42:32.583 --> 1:42:34.250
-Where are you?
-Behind your house.

1:42:34.500 --> 1:42:35.666
Two minutes.

1:42:52.083 --> 1:42:52.958
Track him.

1:42:54.500 --> 1:42:56.666
-Hello?
-Is it Subash Chandra Bose?

1:42:58.125 --> 1:42:59.250
Yes, Bose here.

1:42:59.333 --> 1:43:00.250
Who are you?

1:43:00.333 --> 1:43:01.666
I am…

1:43:03.416 --> 1:43:04.583
-Tell me.
-Nehru!

1:43:05.083 --> 1:43:05.916
Nehru?

1:43:06.166 --> 1:43:07.125
Jawaharlal Nehru.

1:43:09.416 --> 1:43:10.583
-Thyagu?
-Hello?

1:43:10.666 --> 1:43:13.791
Are we in the present or have we
time-traveled to the Independence era?

1:43:13.875 --> 1:43:15.041
Hello? Mr. Bose?

1:43:16.583 --> 1:43:18.208
Hello? This is Bose.

1:43:18.291 --> 1:43:20.166
I'm still on the line.
What is the matter?

1:43:20.250 --> 1:43:23.625
You agreed to give that mobile
to Gandhi for 50000 rupees, right?

1:43:23.916 --> 1:43:25.541
-Yes.
-I'll pay you double.

1:43:25.791 --> 1:43:26.708
Give it to me.

1:43:26.875 --> 1:43:30.291
Even if I buy a brand new phone,
the same model costs only 75000 rupees.

1:43:30.375 --> 1:43:31.666
You are offering me one lakh!

1:43:31.791 --> 1:43:34.083
Nehru and Gandhi are ganging up
to make me look like a fool?

1:43:34.166 --> 1:43:35.875
Mind you! I am Bose.

1:43:35.958 --> 1:43:38.041
Of course not! I'm not playing with you.

1:43:38.333 --> 1:43:40.500
That phone belongs to me.

1:43:40.833 --> 1:43:43.166
If it reaches Gandhi's hands
it will become a royal mess.

1:43:43.500 --> 1:43:44.333
What?

1:43:44.541 --> 1:43:46.000
My aunt Indira Gandhi.

1:43:46.083 --> 1:43:47.041
Indira Gandhi?

1:43:47.541 --> 1:43:50.250
-It's personal, Mr. Bose.
-Okay, buddy.

1:43:50.333 --> 1:43:52.333
Gandhi and Nehru
can have 101 problems.

1:43:52.416 --> 1:43:54.291
You've promised me
an extra 50000 rupees.

1:43:54.541 --> 1:43:56.791
I'll tell you the venue.
"Gandhi Mandapam" for Gandhi.

1:43:57.125 --> 1:43:58.708
Nehru Statue for Nehru.

1:43:59.166 --> 1:44:00.000
Kathipara.

1:44:00.083 --> 1:44:02.500
Bro, come directly over there.

1:44:02.708 --> 1:44:05.291
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
We'll clinch the deal.

1:44:05.375 --> 1:44:07.208
-What do you say?
-Okay, Mr. Subash Chandra Bose.

1:44:07.291 --> 1:44:08.708
-Start your bike.
-I'll be there, Bose.

1:44:16.500 --> 1:44:17.916
Keep tracking him.
Where is he?

1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:19.625
Sir, he isn't going to "Gandhi Mandapam".

1:44:19.708 --> 1:44:21.791
Instead of turning left,
he has turned right.

1:44:21.875 --> 1:44:22.791
What the hell are you saying?

1:44:24.875 --> 1:44:26.916
Why is he calling me
as if I'm his girlfriend?

1:44:27.041 --> 1:44:27.875
Hello, Father?

1:44:28.291 --> 1:44:30.000
Hello, Bose sir!

1:44:30.083 --> 1:44:32.750
Your friend Nehru has agreed
to give me 50,000 rupees extra.

1:44:32.833 --> 1:44:34.416
So I'm giving this mobile to him.

1:44:34.500 --> 1:44:36.750
So stop hassling me.
Kindly hang up.

1:44:38.791 --> 1:44:40.583
My friend Nehru?

1:44:40.916 --> 1:44:42.166
He is paying extra?

1:44:42.625 --> 1:44:44.125
Sir, I think your phone is bugged.

1:44:47.583 --> 1:44:48.916
Where the hell is he going?

1:44:49.083 --> 1:44:50.666
Sir, he's moving towards Kathipara.

1:44:50.833 --> 1:44:51.666
Give me the phone.

1:44:52.875 --> 1:44:54.041
Kathipara, turn towards Kathipara.

1:44:57.458 --> 1:44:59.000
Sir, his name is Diamond Babu.

1:44:59.083 --> 1:45:01.291
He owns a phone shop, sir.
His hobby is to steal mobiles.

1:45:01.375 --> 1:45:02.916
I've sent his original number to you.

1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:03.875
Please check.

1:45:04.125 --> 1:45:05.041
Narayana, stop.

1:45:07.166 --> 1:45:08.041
Here's your fare.

1:45:08.666 --> 1:45:11.500
-Only 40 rupees, bro?
-Be happy I paid you.

1:45:11.583 --> 1:45:12.666
Or I'll flick your meter!

1:45:15.291 --> 1:45:17.250
Who is calling me from a fancy number?

1:45:17.791 --> 1:45:19.458
-Hello?
-Hey!

1:45:19.916 --> 1:45:22.250
-Aren't you Diamond Babu?
-No, Superstar Mahesh Babu.

1:45:22.333 --> 1:45:24.000
-What do you want?
-I spoke to you now, I'm Gandhi.

1:45:24.291 --> 1:45:26.916
Father, how do you know my real name?

1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:28.250
We are SATS, dude!

1:45:28.833 --> 1:45:29.666
Socks… means?

1:45:29.750 --> 1:45:31.125
Police, I say. Police.

1:45:31.375 --> 1:45:33.166
Police?
What do you mean, Father?

1:45:33.250 --> 1:45:34.833
We know your entire horoscope.

1:45:34.916 --> 1:45:36.250
Listen to me carefully.

1:45:36.500 --> 1:45:38.583
-Tell me.
-A chap called you just now.

1:45:38.833 --> 1:45:40.916
-Told you to come to Kathipara?
-Yes.

1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:42.250
He is a murderer.

1:45:46.541 --> 1:45:48.750
-Murderer?
-That phone you stole…

1:45:48.833 --> 1:45:50.791
he killed the owner
and grabbed that mobile.

1:45:50.875 --> 1:45:52.333
Now he will kill you too.

1:45:52.416 --> 1:45:54.541
-And take that mobile from you.
-Kill me?!

1:45:56.083 --> 1:45:58.541
Oh no! Father.
That Nehru is calling me.

1:45:58.708 --> 1:45:59.958
Don't answer that call.

1:46:00.041 --> 1:46:02.041
-Do not answer.
-He hasn't even asked me, Father.

1:46:02.125 --> 1:46:03.375
Okay, what should I do now?

1:46:03.458 --> 1:46:05.416
He isn't picking up my call.

1:46:05.500 --> 1:46:07.125
Don't panic.
I'm coming over there.

1:46:07.208 --> 1:46:09.958
Go and wait inside
Le Meridien that's nearby.

1:46:10.041 --> 1:46:11.166
We'll meet you there.

1:46:11.250 --> 1:46:12.625
-Okay?
-Okay, Father.

1:46:12.708 --> 1:46:15.166
I'll book a suite room and relax.
Come and pay the bill.

1:46:15.416 --> 1:46:17.416
-Hey! He knows.
-Nab him.

1:46:17.500 --> 1:46:18.833
Get me biryani when you come.

1:46:18.916 --> 1:46:20.625
You take care of the CCTV camera.

1:46:41.041 --> 1:46:42.166
-Dhilip, search this side.
-Okay.

1:46:42.291 --> 1:46:43.708
-Aravind, you track.
-Okay.

1:46:43.791 --> 1:46:44.833
You come, quick!

1:46:49.791 --> 1:46:52.208
Sir, someone has hacked
the CCTV cameras.

1:46:58.875 --> 1:46:59.708
Where?

1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:00.875
Which floor?

1:47:01.208 --> 1:47:02.041
Sir.

1:47:02.375 --> 1:47:03.208
Fourth floor, sir.

1:47:03.666 --> 1:47:05.875
He's moving in the corridor
towards the east wing exit.

1:47:28.375 --> 1:47:29.750
-Aravind?
-Sir.

1:47:30.333 --> 1:47:31.208
I have been hacked, sir.

1:47:33.458 --> 1:47:34.833
-Hey!
-Move aside.

1:47:34.916 --> 1:47:35.750
Wait, I say.

1:47:37.208 --> 1:47:38.750
-Hey.
-Mr. Diamond Babu.

1:47:39.541 --> 1:47:42.041
-Give me the phone.
-Gandhi or Nehru's team?

1:47:42.458 --> 1:47:43.583
Gandhi's team.
Give me the phone.

1:47:43.666 --> 1:47:44.541
Come over here.

1:47:45.708 --> 1:47:47.458
I asked you for 50000 rupees.

1:47:47.541 --> 1:47:49.083
Just pay my auto fare.
I'll give it to you.

1:47:49.166 --> 1:47:50.625
You won't get a single paisa.
Give me the phone.

1:47:52.208 --> 1:47:53.041
Where is it on you?

1:47:53.416 --> 1:47:54.500
Why are you frisking me?

1:47:54.750 --> 1:47:56.375
-Phone?
-It is in my hand.

1:47:58.000 --> 1:47:58.833
Thanks.

1:47:59.083 --> 1:48:00.500
Tufty, where are you going?

1:48:00.625 --> 1:48:02.291
Nehru is hell-bent on killing me.

1:48:02.375 --> 1:48:03.708
-You're just going away?
-What to do--

1:48:03.791 --> 1:48:06.375
Why are you creating a ruckus
in front of my room?

1:48:06.666 --> 1:48:08.125
-Welcome!
-Don't let him escape.

1:48:09.333 --> 1:48:11.458
Get lost, man.
Hi Shilpa, remember me?

1:48:19.375 --> 1:48:20.250
Hey!

1:48:22.083 --> 1:48:23.583
Youngblood with guts and grit

1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:27.375
Hey, Jeevan!

1:48:29.041 --> 1:48:30.708
You're talking to a real GOAT

1:48:31.291 --> 1:48:33.291
The V-I-J-A-Y

1:48:34.125 --> 1:48:35.208
What are you doing here?

1:48:35.416 --> 1:48:36.458
Nothing much, Uncle.

1:48:36.625 --> 1:48:38.625
I thought I'd get the phone from you.

1:48:42.333 --> 1:48:43.375
Uncle, give it to me.

1:48:45.375 --> 1:48:46.250
Hey, Uncle!

1:48:47.333 --> 1:48:48.166
Give it to me, dude.

1:48:49.166 --> 1:48:50.000
Nehru?

1:48:50.166 --> 1:48:52.291
Jawaharlal Nehru.

1:48:54.833 --> 1:48:56.958
Jeevan, listen to me.

1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:21.000
No! Uncle.

1:49:24.083 --> 1:49:25.541
What is this, Uncle?

1:49:54.500 --> 1:49:55.750
Uncle, get up. Your time's up!

1:50:01.166 --> 1:50:02.041
Just a bit longer.

1:50:02.333 --> 1:50:03.416
Bear with it.

1:50:03.500 --> 1:50:04.708
Don't move.

1:50:06.083 --> 1:50:07.083
Where the hell is he?!

1:50:09.750 --> 1:50:11.375
You say you've been hacked.

1:50:11.791 --> 1:50:13.750
Ajay says CCTV footage has been hacked.

1:50:14.791 --> 1:50:16.500
-Sir!
-It's over, finished.

1:50:19.375 --> 1:50:21.291
Bear with it, Uncle.
Just a few more seconds.

1:50:21.666 --> 1:50:22.500
That's all.

1:50:22.750 --> 1:50:23.583
That's it.

1:50:23.791 --> 1:50:25.166
Close. Chapter close.

1:50:35.541 --> 1:50:36.875
Oh shit!

1:50:37.750 --> 1:50:38.916
Hey! Stop.

1:51:16.833 --> 1:51:18.125
Oh no! Dad.

1:51:18.791 --> 1:51:20.291
-Hey!
-Uncle.

1:51:21.250 --> 1:51:23.541
-Sorry, Dad.
-What are you doing here?

1:51:23.625 --> 1:51:26.375
No, Dad, I wanted to
spend time with Sreeni--

1:51:26.458 --> 1:51:27.500
Okay, don't hang around here.

1:51:27.833 --> 1:51:30.083
-Okay.
-They killed Ajay, sir.

1:51:30.166 --> 1:51:31.083
He's lying dead here, sir.

1:51:31.166 --> 1:51:32.916
-Where?
-Laundry room, sir.

1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:34.208
What are you saying?

1:51:37.541 --> 1:51:39.583
-Did you ask me to come for this?
-No!

1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:41.875
Then?

1:51:44.041 --> 1:51:45.000
For a song.

1:52:13.125 --> 1:52:16.458
She looks at me, it's an electric spark

1:52:16.666 --> 1:52:20.000
She walks in front of me, it's a catwalk

1:52:20.208 --> 1:52:21.916
Hey, swing it
Hey, break it

1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:23.625
Hey, feel it
Hey, touch it

1:52:23.750 --> 1:52:25.375
Hey, swing it
Hey, break it

1:52:25.541 --> 1:52:27.375
Hey, feel it, feel it
Touch it, touch it

1:52:27.458 --> 1:52:30.583
Your hands signaled a brake to me

1:52:30.666 --> 1:52:33.958
Thanks to you, I turned weak truly

1:52:34.041 --> 1:52:38.166
Oh no! In my heart, you embedded tight
Offering aphrodisiac laced with delight

1:52:38.416 --> 1:52:41.666
You danced into my dreams so often
Nudging slumbering desires to awaken

1:52:41.958 --> 1:52:45.208
I will make your dream come true now

1:52:45.291 --> 1:52:48.500
Once you feel the joy, I take this vow
I will start all over again, my love

1:52:48.583 --> 1:52:50.000
Hey, swing it
Hey, break it

1:52:50.083 --> 1:52:51.833
Hey, feel it
Hey, touch it

1:52:51.916 --> 1:52:53.666
Hey, swing it
Hey, break it

1:52:53.833 --> 1:52:55.500
Hey, feel it
Hey, touch it

1:52:55.583 --> 1:52:57.208
Hey, swing it
Hey, break it

1:52:57.291 --> 1:52:58.958
Hey, feel it
Hey, touch it

1:52:59.041 --> 1:53:00.750
Hey, swing it
Hey, break it

1:53:00.833 --> 1:53:02.875
Hey, feel it, feel it
Touch it, touch it

1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:49.666
This is love play to savor every day

1:53:49.875 --> 1:53:52.166
If this job is secured
We must caress enraptured

1:53:52.250 --> 1:53:55.666
Changes within me, head to toe

1:53:55.750 --> 1:53:58.833
Mind took time to realize though

1:53:58.916 --> 1:54:02.708
Hey! It created havoc in my tender body

1:54:02.791 --> 1:54:06.041
Always in all ways a golden rhapsody

1:54:06.125 --> 1:54:09.375
Hey! Something in me
Tingling tickling temptingly

1:54:09.625 --> 1:54:12.833
Time is lagging when you don’t kiss me

1:54:12.916 --> 1:54:16.708
I have totally forgotten now
Top or bottom, up or below

1:54:16.791 --> 1:54:18.416
Hey, swing it
Hey, break it

1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:20.166
Hey, feel it
Hey, touch it

1:54:20.250 --> 1:54:21.833
Hey, swing it
Hey, break it

1:54:21.916 --> 1:54:23.833
Hey, feel it, feel it
Touch it, touch it

1:54:23.916 --> 1:54:25.375
Hey, swing it
Hey, break it

1:54:25.458 --> 1:54:27.208
Hey, feel it
Hey, touch it

1:54:27.291 --> 1:54:28.958
Hey, swing it
Hey, break it

1:54:29.041 --> 1:54:31.500
Hey, feel it, feel it
Touch it, touch it

1:54:35.791 --> 1:54:38.958
Don't think that you can lie
and escape from here easily.

1:54:39.250 --> 1:54:40.375
Didn't you flick this phone from him?

1:54:41.458 --> 1:54:42.916
He will look far better
than this man, sir.

1:54:45.875 --> 1:54:47.208
You remember his face, right?

1:54:47.916 --> 1:54:48.958
Yes, sir.

1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:53.375
Aravind, check the CCTV cameras
in the area where he flicked this phone.

1:54:53.666 --> 1:54:55.958
Sir, do you take me for an imbecile?

1:54:56.208 --> 1:54:58.333
First, I disconnect the camera
and then steal the phone.

1:54:58.708 --> 1:55:01.416
Two officers have died because
of some information on that phone.

1:55:01.666 --> 1:55:04.166
That phone contains something
the murderer needs desperately.

1:55:04.416 --> 1:55:06.916
Don't be scared, tell us
whatever you find on that phone.

1:55:07.375 --> 1:55:08.750
I told you right in the beginning.

1:55:09.416 --> 1:55:12.208
I steal a mobile, sir, but I'll never
fiddle with the content inside.

1:55:12.666 --> 1:55:14.416
If you want you can ask
the customers I stole from.

1:55:14.791 --> 1:55:16.041
They will agree. I'm a decent worker.

1:55:17.541 --> 1:55:18.500
Send him off.

1:55:31.458 --> 1:55:32.291
What, dude?

1:55:32.916 --> 1:55:35.875
If only Ajay hadn't come home
for lunch that day.

1:55:36.875 --> 1:55:38.583
He would be alive now, right?

1:55:38.833 --> 1:55:40.291
Please don't start this again.

1:55:40.958 --> 1:55:42.625
You are not to blame.
Cool down.

1:55:44.166 --> 1:55:45.375
Twice.

1:55:46.166 --> 1:55:49.250
I missed him twice
though he came this close to me.

1:55:49.666 --> 1:55:51.375
When we have no idea
about his identity.

1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:53.833
We must find out his motive.

1:55:54.250 --> 1:55:57.750
I'm analyzing all the cases
Nazeer sir handled last.

1:55:57.833 --> 1:55:58.666
No.

1:55:59.291 --> 1:56:02.041
This is not connected to a case
handled by Nazeer.

1:56:02.625 --> 1:56:04.875
If so, why did he single me out
and want to meet me?

1:56:05.500 --> 1:56:07.958
This is an issue
connecting all of us.

1:56:08.291 --> 1:56:11.291
How can this be
connected to the three of us?

1:56:11.791 --> 1:56:13.625
You left the Force many years ago.

1:56:13.958 --> 1:56:15.291
Maybe a long-time revenge?

1:56:15.833 --> 1:56:17.833
Gandhi as an agent
nabbed this perpetrator.

1:56:18.208 --> 1:56:19.875
Perp wants him back
as an agent to seek revenge.

1:56:20.375 --> 1:56:22.291
Why are you narrating the story
of "Sathriyan" to us?

1:56:23.375 --> 1:56:24.333
Jeevan.

1:56:24.416 --> 1:56:25.500
What?

1:56:26.291 --> 1:56:28.958
All this is happening
only after Jeevan came back to us.

1:56:30.375 --> 1:56:31.541
He told me on that day we met.

1:56:32.041 --> 1:56:34.125
That gang won't leave us alone
if he comes back with me.

1:56:37.458 --> 1:56:38.500
Yes, Rajendran.

1:56:38.583 --> 1:56:40.541
You asked me to place
the Moscow gang on red alert.

1:56:40.625 --> 1:56:42.583
Harbor police has arrested
one of them called Abdhul, sir.

1:56:42.833 --> 1:56:43.666
What?

1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:53.875
He tried to enter
with a different ID, sir.

1:56:53.958 --> 1:56:55.083
But he got caught
in the face screening.

1:56:56.375 --> 1:56:58.291
I'm going to the harbor.
Please come there, sir.

1:57:02.375 --> 1:57:04.250
-What happened?
-Drive to the harbor.

1:57:04.458 --> 1:57:05.958
-Why?
-Just do as I say.

1:57:06.041 --> 1:57:07.250
-Go to the harbor.
-Okay.

1:57:10.875 --> 1:57:12.416
-Yes, dude.
-What happened?

1:57:12.875 --> 1:57:14.208
I am waiting at the harbor.

1:57:14.416 --> 1:57:15.541
The ship must have berthed.

1:57:15.791 --> 1:57:16.750
Yes, it did.

1:57:17.083 --> 1:57:18.416
But no one has stepped out.

1:57:18.958 --> 1:57:20.666
Hey, bro, what are you doing?

1:57:20.750 --> 1:57:23.500
Dad has been trying to call you.
Your line is busy it seems.

1:57:23.708 --> 1:57:25.250
He's on the line, talk to him.

1:57:26.250 --> 1:57:28.750
Give me. Sorry, I was
on the phone about something else.

1:57:29.333 --> 1:57:30.750
Sreenidhi, right?

1:57:30.833 --> 1:57:31.750
No! Just give.

1:57:33.041 --> 1:57:34.458
Yes, Dad. Tell me.

1:57:34.750 --> 1:57:35.666
Jeevan.

1:57:36.250 --> 1:57:37.166
Don't get tensed.

1:57:37.666 --> 1:57:39.625
A guy from the Moscow gang
you were a part of

1:57:39.708 --> 1:57:41.083
has been arrested at the Chennai harbor.

1:57:51.041 --> 1:57:53.000
Kalyan, Sunil and I are heading there.

1:57:53.083 --> 1:57:55.708
I will take all of them under my custody.

1:57:55.791 --> 1:57:56.750
Why I'm telling you this?

1:57:56.833 --> 1:57:59.708
They can't touch you, but still, to be
on the safe side, you stay at home.

1:57:59.791 --> 1:58:02.458
Don't tell Mom.
She will panic. Okay?

1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:07.833
Hey, Sha!

1:58:08.125 --> 1:58:10.375
Abdhul has been arrested
by Harbor Security.

1:58:11.125 --> 1:58:14.083
-What are you saying?
-They don't know yet my dad is over there.

1:58:14.791 --> 1:58:16.375
If Gandhi reaches the harbor,

1:58:17.125 --> 1:58:18.791
he will definitely identify my dad.

1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:21.083
-Tell me what to do now.
-Shall we rescue them?

1:58:21.166 --> 1:58:22.291
That is not as eas--

1:58:23.500 --> 1:58:26.166
Hey! Harbor Security and
the police are going in now.

1:58:26.250 --> 1:58:28.333
I think they are aware.
We'll get caught if we go in.

1:58:28.583 --> 1:58:30.041
I'm not a coward.

1:58:30.208 --> 1:58:31.125
It isn't that, dude.

1:58:31.208 --> 1:58:32.291
Come up with another plan.

1:58:32.833 --> 1:58:34.583
Hello, Sreenidhi?

1:58:34.750 --> 1:58:36.750
Sorry, I can't come today.

1:58:36.833 --> 1:58:38.125
Dad has told me not to step out.

1:58:54.958 --> 1:58:55.833
Hey!

1:58:56.458 --> 1:58:58.083
Sreenidhi, hey!

1:59:00.750 --> 1:59:02.291
Hey! Who are you?

1:59:02.416 --> 1:59:03.291
What is it?

1:59:03.833 --> 1:59:05.208
-Sreenidhi!
-Hey!

1:59:05.375 --> 1:59:07.458
You have to release
within five minutes all those

1:59:07.541 --> 1:59:09.000
under your custody in the harbor.

1:59:10.250 --> 1:59:13.250
Otherwise, at the sixth minute,
I will call you back.

1:59:13.833 --> 1:59:14.666
Who is it?

1:59:14.833 --> 1:59:16.166
Your daughter's head…

1:59:18.125 --> 1:59:19.583
it will be detached and rolling.

1:59:22.583 --> 1:59:23.541
Hey!

1:59:23.625 --> 1:59:26.041
-Don't panic. Who is it?
-I don't know.

1:59:26.458 --> 1:59:29.041
If we don't release the men in the harbor,

1:59:29.125 --> 1:59:30.458
some chap is threatening
to kill Sreenidhi.

1:59:30.541 --> 1:59:32.875
Didn't Sreenidhi go to Ajay's house?

1:59:32.958 --> 1:59:34.125
Don't know, she said she was going out.

1:59:34.208 --> 1:59:35.375
-Sunil…
-Didn't say where.

1:59:35.666 --> 1:59:37.166
-Hey.
-Mobile.

1:59:37.416 --> 1:59:39.583
-Her mobile is switched off.
-Calm down, she'll be fine.

1:59:39.666 --> 1:59:40.583
We'll handle it.

1:59:43.166 --> 1:59:44.250
Tell me, sir.

1:59:44.541 --> 1:59:47.041
I've sent you a number.
Track the location immediately.

1:59:55.708 --> 1:59:56.583
Relax.

1:59:57.375 --> 1:59:59.000
Jeevan, what are you doing?

2:00:00.250 --> 2:00:02.291
You promised a long drive.
Just the two of us.

2:00:02.500 --> 2:00:03.875
I am terrified.

2:00:04.958 --> 2:00:07.958
Sreenidhi, I'm so so sorry, Sreenidhi.

2:00:09.250 --> 2:00:10.291
I had no other option.

2:00:12.333 --> 2:00:14.958
My dad has been caught by your dad.

2:00:15.166 --> 2:00:17.000
Your dad won't let him go
if I ask him directly.

2:00:17.750 --> 2:00:19.458
As soon as your dad
releases my dad.

2:00:19.916 --> 2:00:21.125
We can leave this place.

2:00:21.333 --> 2:00:22.500
What are you saying?

2:00:22.708 --> 2:00:24.416
Your dad is my dad's captive?

2:00:24.500 --> 2:00:25.875
Please let me go.

2:00:27.625 --> 2:00:28.583
Don't you trust me?

2:00:31.125 --> 2:00:31.958
Then be happy.

2:00:33.833 --> 2:00:35.083
Smile.

2:00:35.166 --> 2:00:36.500
You look so beautiful when you smile.

2:00:38.375 --> 2:00:41.000
His mobile was last traced
somewhere near Tambaram.

2:00:41.083 --> 2:00:41.916
Let's go.

2:00:43.083 --> 2:00:43.958
Come on, I say.

2:00:44.125 --> 2:00:45.833
What will we do over there?

2:00:45.916 --> 2:00:48.458
Like he said let us release them.

2:00:48.583 --> 2:00:49.750
First, let's save Sreenidhi.

2:00:49.833 --> 2:00:51.125
-Please, dude.
-Kalyan.

2:00:51.375 --> 2:00:52.500
Talk like an agent.

2:00:54.166 --> 2:00:55.041
Gandhi?

2:00:56.041 --> 2:00:58.416
You think your son will be
in trouble if they are released?

2:00:58.500 --> 2:01:00.083
How can you even say this?

2:01:00.500 --> 2:01:03.500
If they are released, what's the guarantee
the murderer will let Sreenidhi go?

2:01:03.916 --> 2:01:05.708
We should not let him get away this time.

2:01:05.791 --> 2:01:06.625
Hey!

2:01:07.166 --> 2:01:09.583
My daughter is dying there
in the hands of a murderer.

2:01:10.041 --> 2:01:11.416
Don't you have a daughter?

2:01:12.041 --> 2:01:14.166
Would you be talking like this
if she was in a similar situation?

2:01:14.250 --> 2:01:15.250
Sunil. Please, bro.

2:01:15.416 --> 2:01:17.166
Sreenidhi is like my daughter too.

2:01:17.250 --> 2:01:19.875
-Shut up!
-I feel the same way you do.

2:01:20.208 --> 2:01:21.083
In that case,

2:01:21.833 --> 2:01:22.791
here, call him.

2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.125
Let them be released.
We can save Sreenidhi, dude.

2:01:25.208 --> 2:01:26.375
At least you call.

2:01:26.458 --> 2:01:28.458
Sunil, listen to me.

2:01:28.708 --> 2:01:32.666
He will need Sreenidhi only till we have
the men he needs under our custody.

2:01:32.750 --> 2:01:35.583
If we release them,
he will do anything to Sreenidhi.

2:01:35.958 --> 2:01:38.041
He killed Ajay for a bloody phone!

2:01:45.083 --> 2:01:45.958
Wait, I'll--

2:01:46.750 --> 2:01:48.000
-Hey! Give me that phone.
-Hey!

2:01:48.541 --> 2:01:49.416
Hey!

2:01:50.333 --> 2:01:52.750
Both of you are fighting
instead of saving Sreenidhi.

2:01:53.750 --> 2:01:54.916
Think of our next move.

2:01:55.583 --> 2:01:56.583
Jokers!

2:01:56.666 --> 2:01:58.166
Sreenidhi, why are they doing this?

2:01:58.916 --> 2:02:00.958
-Let me go.
-Doesn't your dad love you?

2:02:01.333 --> 2:02:02.708
Doesn't he care for you?

2:02:03.166 --> 2:02:04.125
Then why?

2:02:04.708 --> 2:02:06.083
Because the reason is…

2:02:06.208 --> 2:02:07.791
He is not scared of me.

2:02:08.666 --> 2:02:10.333
Just wait. I will show him.

2:02:10.541 --> 2:02:12.125
He'll know I mean business.

2:02:16.541 --> 2:02:17.833
Dude, video call.

2:02:23.583 --> 2:02:25.041
You didn't take my threat seriously?

2:02:25.500 --> 2:02:26.333
Hey!

2:02:26.500 --> 2:02:28.208
If you don't release them,

2:02:28.416 --> 2:02:30.291
you won't get a call from me next.

2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:33.875
Hey!

2:02:34.375 --> 2:02:36.166
You'll get a beheaded daughter.

2:02:37.625 --> 2:02:39.125
Sunil.

2:02:40.416 --> 2:02:41.500
-Hey.
-Please, somehow…

2:02:41.958 --> 2:02:43.291
save my daughter.

2:02:43.375 --> 2:02:44.541
-Please save her.
-Give me the phone.

2:02:57.083 --> 2:03:00.041
-Hello?
-Release Abdhul and Co., sir.

2:03:00.625 --> 2:03:01.541
What do you mean, sir?

2:03:01.625 --> 2:03:03.791
Release him and have him
followed by MUFTI, sir.

2:03:07.416 --> 2:03:08.333
Release all of them.

2:03:12.458 --> 2:03:13.458
Finally!

2:03:15.625 --> 2:03:18.458
Looks like love shows up
only if the knife speaks.

2:03:18.958 --> 2:03:20.375
Otherwise, it's impossible, right?

2:03:23.625 --> 2:03:24.875
Oh no!

2:03:25.958 --> 2:03:28.125
Let me immediately…

2:03:28.541 --> 2:03:30.250
-administer First Aid.
-No, don't.

2:03:31.208 --> 2:03:33.083
Look how your dad
drives me to insane limits.

2:03:33.791 --> 2:03:35.625
It's over, just a dab.

2:03:36.458 --> 2:03:38.000
-Is it hurting?
-Yes.

2:03:38.291 --> 2:03:40.625
Please, I'll leave.
Let me go.

2:03:41.375 --> 2:03:42.791
-Please.
-Why do you say that?

2:03:43.333 --> 2:03:44.250
You shouldn't be saying that.

2:03:44.750 --> 2:03:46.583
I love you, darling.

2:03:49.791 --> 2:03:52.083
You saw how much I love you?

2:03:52.375 --> 2:03:55.541
Sir, the location shows Tambaram.
A closed theme park.

2:03:57.583 --> 2:03:59.166
When everything is alright,

2:04:00.208 --> 2:04:01.875
won't you snitch to your dad about me?

2:04:02.208 --> 2:04:04.333
You'll say, "Jeevan tried
to kill me by slitting my throat."

2:04:05.041 --> 2:04:06.500
No, I won't tell him.

2:04:06.750 --> 2:04:08.958
-You won't snitch, right?
-I swear I won't.

2:04:16.625 --> 2:04:17.875
I've slit your throat.

2:04:18.875 --> 2:04:20.666
Anyway, you'll naturally
be really mad at me.

2:04:21.416 --> 2:04:24.375
"Who is this psycho
Half Jekyll, half Hyde?

2:04:24.458 --> 2:04:26.625
What will I do if he's like this
even after we are married?"

2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:29.583
Won't you feel this way?

2:04:30.041 --> 2:04:32.375
No, I won't think like that.

2:04:37.500 --> 2:04:39.250
You'll ditch me then, right?

2:04:40.208 --> 2:04:43.041
You won't marry me.
All because of your damn dad!

2:04:48.125 --> 2:04:50.000
I don't want to take the risk.

2:04:50.541 --> 2:04:51.500
Sreenidhi.

2:04:54.750 --> 2:04:55.875
Go with him.

2:04:58.291 --> 2:05:01.625
I cannot kill the girl I love.

2:05:01.708 --> 2:05:03.625
-I can't do it I just can't do it.
-Jeevan…

2:05:03.708 --> 2:05:04.750
I cannot kill her.

2:05:04.833 --> 2:05:06.041
Jeevan, please.

2:05:06.833 --> 2:05:07.708
Sreenidhi?

2:05:08.416 --> 2:05:09.250
Sreenidhi?

2:05:11.875 --> 2:05:12.791
Sreenidhi?

2:05:13.666 --> 2:05:15.708
-Light slit, very light.
-Please.

2:05:16.625 --> 2:05:17.500
Jeevan!

2:05:17.583 --> 2:05:20.333
Before you bleed yourself to death,

2:05:20.666 --> 2:05:23.208
let them save you,
if they can reach here in time.

2:05:23.541 --> 2:05:25.500
Don't move. It will hurt you.

2:05:25.666 --> 2:05:27.041
That's all. It's done.

2:05:27.416 --> 2:05:28.375
Done and dusted!

2:05:29.208 --> 2:05:30.125
Chapter closed.

2:05:35.375 --> 2:05:37.791
I love you madly, deeply.
This is true love, sweetheart.

2:05:39.666 --> 2:05:41.541
You may think I'm lying
but it is honest to God truth.

2:05:41.875 --> 2:05:43.583
Shit! I'm not lying.

2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:50.916
"For mere humans to understand
this is no mortal love in this land.

2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:52.291
Not the usual kind.

2:05:52.375 --> 2:05:53.583
The most unique find.

2:05:53.666 --> 2:05:54.958
That cannot be defined.

2:05:55.166 --> 2:05:57.666
Crossing every boundary
pure and full of glory.

2:05:57.750 --> 2:05:58.875
Most sacred in history.

2:05:58.958 --> 2:06:00.416
Most sacred in history."

2:06:10.583 --> 2:06:11.541
Sreenidhi.

2:06:17.083 --> 2:06:17.958
Sreenidhi!

2:06:18.208 --> 2:06:19.708
Sreenidhi, look at me.

2:06:19.791 --> 2:06:21.208
Look at me, Sreenidhi.

2:06:22.375 --> 2:06:23.250
Look up.

2:06:29.916 --> 2:06:30.750
My dear girl.

2:06:33.750 --> 2:06:34.583
Oh no!

2:06:35.583 --> 2:06:36.625
Jeevan.

2:06:39.375 --> 2:06:40.250
What?

2:06:41.166 --> 2:06:42.250
It was Jeevan.

2:06:44.166 --> 2:06:45.625
Jeevan was the one…

2:06:47.166 --> 2:06:48.000
How, child?

2:06:48.791 --> 2:06:51.791
You promised Jeevan
you wouldn't whisper a word to anyone.

2:06:52.500 --> 2:06:54.041
Now you are blurting it out to me?

2:06:57.083 --> 2:06:58.125
Isn't that wrong on your part?

2:07:08.250 --> 2:07:11.583
Menon, I swear I didn't know
you were with your family on the train.

2:07:12.083 --> 2:07:14.166
If I had known I wouldn't have
allowed this operation.

2:07:14.500 --> 2:07:15.541
Even now,

2:07:15.833 --> 2:07:17.916
I've convinced my SATS team
that you are dead.

2:07:18.125 --> 2:07:20.125
The pain and trauma
I went through,

2:07:20.666 --> 2:07:22.166
Gandhi should have experienced it too.

2:07:22.250 --> 2:07:23.833
Transfer money to my account.

2:07:23.916 --> 2:07:25.000
I will handle the rest.

2:07:25.458 --> 2:07:26.666
Gandhi is coming to Moscow.

2:07:26.750 --> 2:07:27.958
Ask Jeevan to be ready.

2:07:30.958 --> 2:07:32.500
Menon is still alive.

2:07:32.583 --> 2:07:36.125
What puzzles me is…
why he faked his death.

2:07:36.750 --> 2:07:38.041
First, I have to meet Gandhi.

2:07:38.125 --> 2:07:40.875
And show him all the evidence
I have saved on my phone.

2:07:41.333 --> 2:07:42.250
I'll handle this

2:07:43.333 --> 2:07:44.166
Hey!

2:07:46.250 --> 2:07:47.541
It is very confusing, sir.

2:07:47.625 --> 2:07:48.625
What is that data?

2:07:48.833 --> 2:07:50.958
Why should he bring it
all the way to meet Gandhi?

2:07:51.541 --> 2:07:52.625
JEEVAN
I HAVE KIDNAPPED Sreenidhi

2:07:52.708 --> 2:07:53.583
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT

2:08:01.750 --> 2:08:02.625
Sunil.

2:08:49.083 --> 2:08:52.000
We should not spare the beast
who did this to my daughter.

2:08:53.125 --> 2:08:54.458
Whoever he maybe,

2:08:55.291 --> 2:08:57.916
I have to strangle him
with my own hands, dude.

2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:19.916
High in all senses

2:09:25.166 --> 2:09:26.000
Height of drunkenness

2:10:02.875 --> 2:10:05.958
Her walk is a magical melody
She waltzes in, this glam-doll lady

2:10:06.041 --> 2:10:09.000
Poet Kbrotherdasan penned likewise
Here she is, in front of my eyes

2:10:09.083 --> 2:10:12.166
To the rhythm of her gait, her hips sway
She grooves gracefully all the way

2:10:12.250 --> 2:10:15.333
Love-struck, God of Love, with an arrow
Stabbed himself to fall for you!

2:10:17.750 --> 2:10:18.708
Height of all heights!

2:10:20.875 --> 2:10:21.750
Height of charisma

2:10:23.958 --> 2:10:24.916
Height of dance-drama

2:10:26.125 --> 2:10:27.791
Height of mega melodrama

2:10:40.083 --> 2:10:41.375
Height of royal splendor

2:10:41.458 --> 2:10:43.125
What gall! Better surrender!

2:10:43.208 --> 2:10:44.500
Height of royalty

2:10:44.583 --> 2:10:46.250
How dare you threaten me!

2:10:46.333 --> 2:10:49.333
Even a pad can be a bat in cricket
Depends if the yellow army is striking it

2:10:49.416 --> 2:10:52.416
Shovel "Head" digs your grave here
You are as good as dead, no fear

2:10:52.500 --> 2:10:55.375
You fixed the sticks to the bier
You are the egg for the snake here

2:10:55.458 --> 2:10:58.708
You fell into my net easily
Don't think you can hoodwink me

2:11:04.083 --> 2:11:05.083
Don't you underestimate

2:11:10.250 --> 2:11:11.208
Don't miscalculate

2:11:35.791 --> 2:11:38.833
Her walk is a magical melody
She waltzes in, this glam-doll lady

2:11:38.916 --> 2:11:41.958
While we rock and roll in the south
Her beauty waltzes far north

2:11:42.041 --> 2:11:45.041
Preserved in a jar, she is pure honey
Giving heart attacks to more than many

2:11:45.125 --> 2:11:48.208
Love-struck, Cupid with his arrow
Stabbed himself to fall for you!

2:11:49.750 --> 2:11:51.333
Smart cookie
Big shot, VIP

2:11:52.833 --> 2:11:54.458
Son of a gun, eh?
God's gift all the way

2:11:55.916 --> 2:11:57.875
Junior to hog the stage

2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:00.791
Don on a rampage

2:12:03.125 --> 2:12:04.000
Height of celebration

2:12:06.250 --> 2:12:07.125
Height of intoxication

2:12:09.333 --> 2:12:10.250
What a killing!

2:12:12.166 --> 2:12:13.083
Truly thrilling

2:12:18.250 --> 2:12:19.166
Sanjay…

2:12:19.375 --> 2:12:20.500
Sorry, Uncle.

2:12:30.208 --> 2:12:32.583
V times two for Victory

2:12:34.208 --> 2:12:36.458
Winning category

2:12:39.625 --> 2:12:40.500
Beat it

2:12:43.583 --> 2:12:44.500
Killed it

2:12:47.541 --> 2:12:48.458
To the hilt

2:12:51.208 --> 2:12:52.916
Planned hit

2:12:56.333 --> 2:12:57.833
Why are you staring?
Carry him out.

2:12:58.625 --> 2:12:59.708
Sanjay?!

2:13:00.833 --> 2:13:01.916
What is this?

2:13:02.250 --> 2:13:03.166
Gandhi.

2:13:03.833 --> 2:13:05.541
He had Uncle on red alert, Dad.

2:13:06.875 --> 2:13:08.500
That issue in the harbor.

2:13:09.750 --> 2:13:11.833
What if he tracks down Uncle
and lands here also?

2:13:12.291 --> 2:13:13.166
That's why I killed him.

2:13:14.708 --> 2:13:15.541
No problem, Dad.

2:13:16.500 --> 2:13:17.375
It won't be an issue.

2:13:19.541 --> 2:13:21.416
Hey! Take him away.

2:13:21.708 --> 2:13:23.333
-What are you gaping at?
-Leave. Clear out.

2:13:23.416 --> 2:13:24.500
-Clear off
-What's your problem?

2:13:24.750 --> 2:13:26.500
-Go!
-All of you, leave.

2:13:29.166 --> 2:13:30.083
Hey!

2:13:30.791 --> 2:13:32.041
Where is that "yellow sari"?!

2:13:32.666 --> 2:13:34.541
FARMAPURAM BAWAL RESTAURANT

2:13:35.375 --> 2:13:37.375
Just can't trust and eat
biryani in any shop!

2:13:41.958 --> 2:13:42.791
I know this chap.

2:13:45.458 --> 2:13:46.416
Just a few days.

2:13:47.416 --> 2:13:49.083
In just a few days,
everything will be over.

2:13:53.541 --> 2:13:54.583
Yes, Babu.

2:13:54.875 --> 2:13:58.250
Father, I told you I stole a cell
from a chap at the railway station?

2:13:58.333 --> 2:13:59.166
He's here.

2:13:59.416 --> 2:14:00.875
Do this for me.

2:14:00.958 --> 2:14:02.125
-What?
-Follow him.

2:14:02.208 --> 2:14:04.041
Father, I ordered a biryani.
Can I eat and go?

2:14:04.125 --> 2:14:05.208
Hey! Just do what I said.

2:14:05.583 --> 2:14:08.041
Okay, Father
Bring the leaf and come!

2:14:14.583 --> 2:14:15.416
Father.

2:14:15.958 --> 2:14:18.083
That chap with the bag, Father.

2:14:23.166 --> 2:14:24.666
-Follow him.
-Okay, sir.

2:14:24.750 --> 2:14:25.625
Come on.

2:14:32.750 --> 2:14:34.083
-Babu.
-Father?

2:14:34.291 --> 2:14:36.416
-Stay right here and watch.
-This bidi shop?

2:14:37.541 --> 2:14:39.125
Ensure no one enters.
Stay on guard.

2:14:39.208 --> 2:14:41.625
Go ahead, Father.
You know about my quick wit.

2:14:45.666 --> 2:14:46.750
Guys, be careful.

2:14:47.083 --> 2:14:50.666
When Sha returns, everything should be
in its place and not raise any suspicion.

2:14:50.916 --> 2:14:53.291
He shouldn't get
the slightest doubt, got it?

2:14:53.791 --> 2:14:54.708
-Sure, sir.
-Yes, sir.

2:14:55.333 --> 2:14:56.166
Go.

2:14:56.375 --> 2:14:59.416
Sir, we have downloaded data from
the disk we took from Sha's house

2:15:03.458 --> 2:15:04.291
Zoom.

2:15:14.625 --> 2:15:17.541
We released ten men
in the harbor that day, right?

2:15:17.750 --> 2:15:19.875
-Yes, sir.
-Got that CCTV footage?

2:15:19.958 --> 2:15:20.833
Yeah, we have it, sir.

2:15:38.500 --> 2:15:39.416
Menon.

2:15:39.958 --> 2:15:41.250
Do you already know him, sir?

2:15:41.833 --> 2:15:43.833
My ex-boss!

2:15:44.500 --> 2:15:46.541
We thought he was dead.

2:15:46.750 --> 2:15:50.375
If he was in hiding for so many years
and he's showing his face now.

2:15:52.875 --> 2:15:54.833
Something major is gonna happen.

2:16:07.166 --> 2:16:08.875
Hey, guys. Look at this.

2:16:09.583 --> 2:16:10.416
Tell me.

2:16:11.416 --> 2:16:12.916
Okay.

2:16:13.375 --> 2:16:14.500
Night… 12:30 p.m., right?

2:16:15.583 --> 2:16:17.166
Same place, right? I'll be there.

2:16:20.291 --> 2:16:21.708
It has to be Menon.

2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:25.833
My gut feeling says
tomorrow is gonna be our day.

2:16:45.333 --> 2:16:46.416
Hello, Gandhi.

2:16:46.500 --> 2:16:48.166
-I'll call you later.
-Gandhi, one minute.

2:16:48.666 --> 2:16:49.791
Jeevan isn't at home.

2:16:49.875 --> 2:16:51.291
He isn't picking up my call.

2:16:51.375 --> 2:16:52.416
Did you look everywhere?

2:16:52.750 --> 2:16:54.750
He isn't at home.
I've looked all over the place.

2:16:54.875 --> 2:16:56.458
Where did he go?

2:16:57.458 --> 2:17:00.208
Okay, you shouldn't be worried.
I'll try to reach him.

2:17:06.958 --> 2:17:08.125
Where the hell are you?

2:17:08.375 --> 2:17:10.541
Haven't I dinned it to you
the situation is really bad?

2:17:11.416 --> 2:17:13.291
I'll get back soon.
I just went nearby.

2:17:13.375 --> 2:17:14.250
Where are you?

2:17:14.500 --> 2:17:16.458
Not too far, Dad.
I came to meet my friend.

2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:27.208
You are my dad, right?

2:17:27.291 --> 2:17:30.916
One who stripped my life of everything.

2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:32.416
I thought you had passed away.

2:17:32.500 --> 2:17:34.541
He himself stood
right in front of my eyes.

2:17:34.708 --> 2:17:36.375
And returned everything
more than 100%, dude.

2:17:36.458 --> 2:17:37.833
Can you hear me, Dad? Hello?

2:17:45.083 --> 2:17:46.000
Dad?

2:17:47.125 --> 2:17:48.416
Be very careful.

2:17:49.458 --> 2:17:50.458
Sure, I'll--

2:17:53.541 --> 2:17:54.541
ALLAH

2:18:00.958 --> 2:18:01.833
Dad?

2:18:13.750 --> 2:18:15.791
We are being followed.

2:18:15.875 --> 2:18:16.750
-What?
-Leave now.

2:18:16.875 --> 2:18:19.000
-What are you saying?
-We have been surrounded.

2:18:19.083 --> 2:18:19.916
Leave, right now.

2:18:20.083 --> 2:18:21.041
Arrest them.

2:18:21.541 --> 2:18:22.375
Sir?

2:18:22.875 --> 2:18:24.208
Leave. Leave right now!

2:18:26.125 --> 2:18:27.541
Arrest them!

2:18:32.625 --> 2:18:33.458
Go, quick.

2:18:54.166 --> 2:18:55.083
Hi, Gandhi!

2:19:06.958 --> 2:19:07.875
Jeevan.

2:19:08.791 --> 2:19:11.416
If you hadn't been Gandhi's son,

2:19:12.416 --> 2:19:14.958
-This interrogation--
-Brave warrior of Madurai truly

2:19:16.041 --> 2:19:18.041
You kindled me duly

2:19:18.708 --> 2:19:21.375
Whistle echoing in the air hereafter!

2:19:22.125 --> 2:19:26.125
Grandson, warrior of Madurai forever

2:19:30.916 --> 2:19:32.541
Send Gandhi in here.

2:19:34.208 --> 2:19:36.291
I will talk only to Gandhi.

2:19:36.458 --> 2:19:38.083
Just answer all my questions.

2:19:38.291 --> 2:19:39.291
I'll ask him to come.

2:19:42.375 --> 2:19:45.750
I can't listen to anything you say.
You had better listen to me.

2:19:50.416 --> 2:19:51.416
Call Gandhi.

2:19:53.333 --> 2:19:54.166
Sir…

2:19:56.333 --> 2:19:59.125
He is acting over-smart.
You're treating him so courteously.

2:20:00.333 --> 2:20:01.958
Hey! What?

2:20:02.250 --> 2:20:04.000
You think you're being extra-smart?

2:20:04.083 --> 2:20:05.333
After three murders!

2:20:06.958 --> 2:20:07.875
Gandhi, hit him.

2:20:08.916 --> 2:20:09.875
Do you have proof?

2:20:10.833 --> 2:20:14.333
Tell me if you have proof
that I murdered those three.

2:20:14.708 --> 2:20:15.708
Tell me, Dad.

2:20:17.166 --> 2:20:18.625
Do you have proof or not?

2:20:18.791 --> 2:20:20.000
I am your dad.

2:20:20.875 --> 2:20:22.791
I know very well
you murdered the three of them.

2:20:23.041 --> 2:20:24.166
Just two minutes more.

2:20:25.083 --> 2:20:26.833
I'll show you the bloody proof.

2:20:27.625 --> 2:20:28.958
Why are you flipping
the record now, Dad?

2:20:30.416 --> 2:20:31.833
I killed them because you asked me to.

2:20:32.958 --> 2:20:34.125
Are you playing the fool?

2:20:34.583 --> 2:20:35.791
Am I playing the fool?!

2:20:36.250 --> 2:20:37.125
You told me.

2:20:37.583 --> 2:20:39.625
Your cover has been blown by Nazeer bro.

2:20:39.958 --> 2:20:42.083
You said, "Kill him
and I'll protect you.

2:20:44.041 --> 2:20:45.541
"My friends have to be saved."

2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:46.875
What is that girl's name?

2:20:47.333 --> 2:20:49.375
Kidnap Sreenidhi
and give her grief.

2:20:49.583 --> 2:20:50.625
-Hey!
-Don't believe.

2:20:50.708 --> 2:20:51.625
-What is he saying?
-He's lying.

2:20:51.750 --> 2:20:53.833
Now you claim
you'll show me proof.

2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:54.833
Yes.

2:20:55.208 --> 2:20:56.083
Next?

2:20:56.708 --> 2:20:58.041
What do you mean by "next"?

2:20:59.041 --> 2:21:00.166
Dad!

2:21:00.875 --> 2:21:03.583
I thought you'd come to my rescue
and I called you inside.

2:21:03.666 --> 2:21:05.000
Now you're trying to escape.

2:21:05.333 --> 2:21:07.125
I don't understand
what is happening here.

2:21:11.375 --> 2:21:14.416
Do you know how intensely
I loved that girl Sreenidhi?

2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:15.875
Sunil uncle.

2:21:16.666 --> 2:21:17.541
Sunil uncle.

2:21:18.083 --> 2:21:19.916
Sunil uncle, hello?

2:21:21.166 --> 2:21:23.666
Are you there?
Oh no! I can't see any faces.

2:21:23.875 --> 2:21:24.958
I know you'll be there.

2:21:25.250 --> 2:21:28.041
I love Sreenidhi, Uncle.
Why would I kill her?

2:21:28.250 --> 2:21:29.708
Asking me to kidnap Sreenidhi.

2:21:29.791 --> 2:21:32.208
He was the man who updated me
standing right next to you.

2:21:32.458 --> 2:21:33.916
Oh, God! He's coming to hit me?

2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:35.416
He is out to hit me.

2:21:36.291 --> 2:21:38.833
He is trying to kill me.
He is killing me. Oh no!

2:21:39.041 --> 2:21:41.875
-Stop the recording.
-Are you trying to manipulate me?

2:21:41.958 --> 2:21:43.208
-Oh, God!
-Tell me.

2:21:43.291 --> 2:21:44.458
Who asked you to murder them?

2:21:44.708 --> 2:21:45.625
I'll confess.

2:21:45.708 --> 2:21:46.541
Stop the recording.

2:21:46.625 --> 2:21:47.833
Sunil, don't go in.

2:21:47.916 --> 2:21:48.875
Sunil!

2:21:49.208 --> 2:21:51.916
If you do not tell me
what your plan is now…

2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:53.833
-Actually, Dad…
-Tell me!

2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:56.625
They won't see your performance
if you do this here!

2:21:56.708 --> 2:21:58.500
Repeat this over there.

2:21:58.666 --> 2:22:01.625
-Gandhi.
-Uncle, he's trying to kill me.

2:22:01.708 --> 2:22:04.500
-I'll change into an approver!
-Gandhi.

2:22:05.166 --> 2:22:06.000
Let him go.

2:22:06.083 --> 2:22:07.083
What are you doing?

2:22:07.375 --> 2:22:08.500
He has gone astray, dude.

2:22:11.791 --> 2:22:13.000
Thanks, Uncle.

2:22:14.541 --> 2:22:16.000
At least you understand me.

2:22:17.541 --> 2:22:18.375
What, dude?

2:22:18.791 --> 2:22:19.708
Twisting everything?

2:22:20.583 --> 2:22:23.291
Hey! He was my friend
even before you were born.

2:22:24.583 --> 2:22:26.041
I know your dad inside out.

2:22:26.125 --> 2:22:27.666
I know you even better.

2:22:29.500 --> 2:22:31.666
I can easily shoot you now
and get away with it.

2:22:31.916 --> 2:22:33.166
No one can question me.

2:22:34.666 --> 2:22:37.041
But because we are true
to the job we have undertaken,

2:22:37.541 --> 2:22:39.375
we are playing fair
and talking to you.

2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:40.875
Tell me.

2:22:41.291 --> 2:22:42.833
How are you and Menon connected?

2:22:43.541 --> 2:22:44.833
Why did you commit these murders?

2:22:45.375 --> 2:22:46.875
What else have you planned?

2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:49.875
You can't step out alive
without coughing up the truth.

2:22:52.583 --> 2:22:55.458
Oh, my God!

2:22:57.541 --> 2:22:59.666
You are on a totally
different level, Uncle.

2:23:04.541 --> 2:23:06.250
After your daughter's death,

2:23:06.458 --> 2:23:08.708
not even your tears of grief have dried.

2:23:08.791 --> 2:23:10.541
You got back to work
with due diligence.

2:23:11.541 --> 2:23:13.666
In a way it is good.
I killed her, Uncle.

2:23:14.708 --> 2:23:15.750
Despite losing your daughter,

2:23:15.833 --> 2:23:18.625
your work ethic and diligence
will fetch you accolades and awards.

2:23:18.958 --> 2:23:21.000
You can fly kites with it.

2:23:21.458 --> 2:23:22.958
Go back home.

2:23:23.041 --> 2:23:25.875
Hey! If I hear one more word from you…

2:23:26.833 --> 2:23:28.041
One more word from me?

2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:43.000
-Hey!
-Hey!

2:23:56.833 --> 2:23:57.750
Dad?

2:23:58.333 --> 2:23:59.875
I followed your instructions
and killed him too.

2:24:01.125 --> 2:24:03.250
Who is next? Next?

2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:05.291
Oh, my God!

2:24:05.500 --> 2:24:06.750
Hey! Come on, come on.

2:24:17.208 --> 2:24:18.583
Gandhi, open the door.

2:24:20.583 --> 2:24:22.291
Dad, answer your phone.

2:24:22.375 --> 2:24:23.291
Your phone is ringing.

2:24:23.791 --> 2:24:26.166
In case it is an emergency,
answer that call, Dad.

2:24:26.416 --> 2:24:27.791
Won't you listen to me?

2:24:29.083 --> 2:24:30.833
Your wife is calling you repeatedly.

2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:32.750
Ask her if it is a life-threatening issue.

2:24:34.375 --> 2:24:35.666
Mindlessly hitting me!

2:24:37.458 --> 2:24:38.458
Talk to her.

2:24:39.583 --> 2:24:41.625
What do you want?

2:24:43.541 --> 2:24:45.041
Let me go.

2:24:48.166 --> 2:24:49.875
It's your husband Gandhi.

2:24:50.541 --> 2:24:51.833
-Greet him.
-Gandhi.

2:24:52.333 --> 2:24:54.666
-Gandhi.
-How are you, Gandhi?

2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:57.583
Long time no see.

2:24:58.583 --> 2:25:00.125
You know what you should do.

2:25:00.416 --> 2:25:01.291
Careful.

2:25:01.416 --> 2:25:03.625
Return my son safe and sound.

2:25:05.625 --> 2:25:08.416
Go on, do the needful, Dad.

2:25:10.750 --> 2:25:11.666
Open the door.

2:25:11.791 --> 2:25:12.666
Move!

2:25:14.583 --> 2:25:15.541
Hey!

2:25:19.333 --> 2:25:20.250
Gandhi.

2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:23.125
Drop the gun.

2:25:26.541 --> 2:25:27.583
Careful, Dad.

2:25:31.166 --> 2:25:32.041
Please.

2:25:33.291 --> 2:25:34.708
Drop the gun, dude.

2:25:36.583 --> 2:25:37.583
Hey!

2:25:52.083 --> 2:25:53.666
Bye, I'll call you later.

2:26:00.791 --> 2:26:01.666
Jeevan.

2:26:02.041 --> 2:26:03.833
Menon brainwashed you.

2:26:04.250 --> 2:26:06.375
I don't know what he said
to turn you against me.

2:26:06.583 --> 2:26:07.500
Oh!

2:26:07.583 --> 2:26:10.250
But what crime did your mother commit?
Ask him to release her.

2:26:10.625 --> 2:26:13.750
What crime did our family do?
You killed them unjustly.

2:26:14.125 --> 2:26:15.083
In that train.

2:26:15.375 --> 2:26:17.250
Imagine the anguish
my dad would have gone through.

2:26:17.625 --> 2:26:18.500
Listen.

2:26:18.666 --> 2:26:20.833
I didn't know they were on that train.

2:26:20.916 --> 2:26:22.708
Oh! Shut up!

2:26:38.458 --> 2:26:39.458
Gandhi.

2:26:42.833 --> 2:26:43.958
Gandhi?

2:27:07.500 --> 2:27:08.583
Hello, Gandhi.

2:27:09.958 --> 2:27:11.625
Just for this single day,

2:27:12.250 --> 2:27:13.916
I have been waiting for decades.

2:27:18.500 --> 2:27:19.583
-Hey!
-Gandhi.

2:27:19.833 --> 2:27:21.000
Menon.

2:27:24.166 --> 2:27:25.291
Don't be scared.

2:27:26.250 --> 2:27:27.625
I won't lay a finger on you.

2:27:28.375 --> 2:27:30.791
If I had intended any harm,

2:27:30.916 --> 2:27:33.083
after taking your son Jeevan
away from you,

2:27:33.625 --> 2:27:35.083
all these years…

2:27:35.250 --> 2:27:37.291
would I have raised him as my son?

2:27:37.625 --> 2:27:38.583
You kidnapped Jeevan?

2:27:39.750 --> 2:27:42.291
-Why?
-This question is not important now.

2:27:42.791 --> 2:27:44.416
After so many years,

2:27:45.166 --> 2:27:48.666
the question is why has
he returned now as your son?

2:27:50.208 --> 2:27:52.958
Chennai Super Kings playing
against Mumbai.

2:27:53.041 --> 2:27:54.833
Crucial match. Semi-Final.

2:27:55.125 --> 2:27:59.375
This is the perfect match to
decide who is the best team.

2:27:59.791 --> 2:28:02.541
This is a long-standing feud
between CSK vs. Mumbai.

2:28:03.250 --> 2:28:05.833
After murdering the SATS officer
and escaping,

2:28:05.916 --> 2:28:10.416
you along with your son
in the semi-final match today…

2:28:11.208 --> 2:28:13.250
will be framed for a bomb blast
on a mammoth scale.

2:28:24.083 --> 2:28:27.875
Poor innocent people
will die, in multiples of 1000.

2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:30.166
A sea of yellow is flooding
Chepauk Stadium now.

2:28:30.250 --> 2:28:32.958
40,000 cricket enthusiasts
as spectators waving and cheering.

2:28:33.041 --> 2:28:34.250
CSK bowlers.

2:28:34.333 --> 2:28:35.625
What is your answer?

2:28:44.083 --> 2:28:45.291
Why have you parked your van here?

2:28:45.375 --> 2:28:46.666
Sir, there is a problem.
The vehicle isn't moving.

2:28:46.750 --> 2:28:49.083
-Move it.
-I'll go now, sir.

2:28:53.416 --> 2:28:54.333
Move.

2:29:27.375 --> 2:29:30.541
You and your family

2:29:30.666 --> 2:29:32.375
who will go into hiding
will be hunted down by this entire nation.

2:29:33.375 --> 2:29:34.625
How's my plan?

2:29:35.500 --> 2:29:39.041
Just like how you drove me out
of this country branding me a traitor.

2:29:39.291 --> 2:29:42.791
In the same way, this country
will hunt you down for treason.

2:29:44.375 --> 2:29:48.750
You should experience the same anguish
I was forced to go through.

2:29:49.333 --> 2:29:50.250
Menon.

2:29:51.416 --> 2:29:53.500
I had no idea your family
was scorched to death.

2:29:54.833 --> 2:29:56.958
Even if you think
I am to blame for their death,

2:29:57.791 --> 2:30:00.208
that is a bone to pick
between you and me.

2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:03.125
Why should the public suffer?

2:30:03.208 --> 2:30:04.666
No need.
No need, Menon.

2:30:04.958 --> 2:30:05.916
Don't do this.

2:30:06.125 --> 2:30:07.375
Ask Jeevan to stop.

2:30:08.083 --> 2:30:10.583
You think I can stop Jeevan?

2:30:11.333 --> 2:30:12.416
Gandhi.

2:30:12.625 --> 2:30:15.625
You are still thinking
of him as your son.

2:30:16.208 --> 2:30:19.500
Only the plan to take revenge
on you is mine.

2:30:20.166 --> 2:30:22.458
Everything else is his doing.

2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:23.958
You know what?

2:30:24.250 --> 2:30:26.416
He's going to create history.

2:30:29.333 --> 2:30:31.250
-Don't do this.
-Mahatma Gandhi.

2:30:31.958 --> 2:30:33.791
He is our father of the nation.

2:30:34.500 --> 2:30:35.958
M.S. Gandhi.

2:30:37.750 --> 2:30:39.500
Villain of the nation!

2:30:40.375 --> 2:30:41.291
Menon?

2:30:41.958 --> 2:30:43.375
Don't, Menon, wait.

2:30:43.625 --> 2:30:46.291
-No, sharpen your ears.
-Don't do this.

2:30:46.375 --> 2:30:48.750
-Sound of the bomb blast in Chepauk…
-Menon.

2:30:49.083 --> 2:30:50.708
-Menon, please.
-It will deafen you here.

2:30:50.875 --> 2:30:52.250
-Remember this day forever.
-Menon, don't.

2:30:52.333 --> 2:30:54.458
-Your friend will come and arrest you.
-Hear me out, Menon.

2:30:54.583 --> 2:30:55.708
Hey! Son of a gun!

2:31:01.458 --> 2:31:04.625
You're walking away
while I'm talking to you.

2:31:06.708 --> 2:31:09.291
He thinks of himself
as some kind of martyr!

2:31:09.666 --> 2:31:12.458
And as if he was defamed unjustly.

2:31:12.666 --> 2:31:14.208
What a sob story of being wronged!

2:31:14.458 --> 2:31:18.916
If you betray the nation for money
what do you expect other than this?

2:31:19.166 --> 2:31:20.375
Gross! Come back.

2:31:22.125 --> 2:31:24.666
You've planned so much
when you saw me and escaped.

2:31:24.750 --> 2:31:26.583
Imagine, me who chased and caught you.

2:31:27.375 --> 2:31:29.083
How meticulously I would have planned!

2:31:30.291 --> 2:31:31.791
If you tie me up like this,

2:31:32.458 --> 2:31:34.166
do you think I can't spring into action?

2:31:48.916 --> 2:31:49.958
Hello, Menon.

2:31:50.250 --> 2:31:52.750
This isn't your plan to nab me.

2:31:53.166 --> 2:31:55.125
To make you stand in front of me,

2:31:55.208 --> 2:31:56.708
I sketched this plan.

2:31:57.500 --> 2:32:00.875
Father, I told you I stole a cell from
a chap at the railway station? He's here.

2:32:03.791 --> 2:32:06.000
Isn't this a formula for a bomb?

2:32:14.208 --> 2:32:15.291
What is all this, sir?

2:32:15.416 --> 2:32:18.375
They intend to plant a bomb
somewhere in Chennai City.

2:32:18.541 --> 2:32:21.208
The bomb explodes,
rending the air in Chepauk.

2:32:21.291 --> 2:32:22.875
It will deafen you here.

2:32:26.166 --> 2:32:27.708
If you are nabbed and interrogated,

2:32:27.791 --> 2:32:31.625
you'll claim you won't confess,
be it hell or high water or some crap.

2:32:32.333 --> 2:32:33.208
That's why…

2:32:33.541 --> 2:32:36.083
I wanted you to divulge your plan
straight from your mouth.

2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:38.625
This is a mini-drama.

2:32:48.291 --> 2:32:50.083
Gandhi is always…

2:32:51.375 --> 2:32:53.625
Father of the nation, I say!

2:32:55.166 --> 2:32:58.583
First innings, Mumbai
has scored 205 runs.

2:32:58.666 --> 2:32:59.833
CSK!

2:33:00.083 --> 2:33:01.333
CSK!

2:33:01.750 --> 2:33:03.000
CSK!

2:33:03.333 --> 2:33:04.791
CSK!

2:33:09.083 --> 2:33:11.916
In Chepauk, an average score of 170
or max 180 is a tough task to chase.

2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:13.958
Do you have service on your mobile?

2:33:14.041 --> 2:33:17.125
But this is Chepauk.
The lion's den.

2:33:17.291 --> 2:33:19.583
Even if the opposite team
scores 50, CSK will--

2:33:21.166 --> 2:33:23.541
Raghavan sir.
Dry mutton curry.

2:33:23.916 --> 2:33:26.500
Meatballs and bheja fry.

2:33:26.625 --> 2:33:28.375
Eat while it's piping hot.

2:33:29.166 --> 2:33:30.041
Then?

2:33:30.291 --> 2:33:31.250
What's the news?

2:33:31.541 --> 2:33:32.416
We'll win, right?

2:33:33.250 --> 2:33:35.250
Reach the Finals. Cup is ours.

2:33:37.333 --> 2:33:38.416
Mission on.

2:33:40.666 --> 2:33:42.208
Oh, God!

2:33:42.291 --> 2:33:43.791
Shoot out?

2:33:43.958 --> 2:33:45.208
Hey! Who is this?

2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:50.083
Menon?

2:33:54.541 --> 2:33:55.458
Menon?

2:34:29.791 --> 2:34:30.791
Hey, Sunil?!

2:34:32.083 --> 2:34:33.291
How can you be alive?

2:34:33.500 --> 2:34:34.416
Why?

2:34:35.250 --> 2:34:37.125
Only Menon can rise from the dead?

2:34:37.875 --> 2:34:39.041
Won't you accept my resurrection?

2:34:46.250 --> 2:34:48.375
You watched Sreenidhi grow
from a baby to a young girl.

2:34:49.500 --> 2:34:51.041
How did you have the heart to kill her?

2:34:51.125 --> 2:34:52.375
What are you blabbering, dude?

2:34:52.791 --> 2:34:53.916
What did I do?

2:34:55.375 --> 2:34:56.625
Gandhi filled me in.

2:34:56.708 --> 2:34:57.916
You didn't kill her.

2:34:59.083 --> 2:35:00.083
Kalyan killed Sreenidhi.

2:35:00.166 --> 2:35:03.166
Harbor police have arrested Abdhul
whom you asked to place on red alert, sir.

2:35:03.416 --> 2:35:05.083
A guy from the Moscow gang
you were a part of

2:35:05.166 --> 2:35:07.041
has been arrested at the Chennai harbor.

2:35:07.125 --> 2:35:09.583
Release Abdhul and Co., sir.

2:35:09.708 --> 2:35:12.916
Only Rajendran and I knew
his name was Abdhul.

2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:15.791
I was wondering right then
how Kalyan knew.

2:35:16.166 --> 2:35:20.166
So I asked our doctor Venkat
to postmortem Sreenidhi's body.

2:35:20.500 --> 2:35:21.625
In that report,

2:35:21.833 --> 2:35:23.375
she didn't die of strangulation.

2:35:23.625 --> 2:35:24.833
She died of asphyxiation.

2:35:24.916 --> 2:35:25.833
Sreenidhi.

2:35:26.666 --> 2:35:27.958
Go with him.

2:35:29.125 --> 2:35:31.583
Kalyan went straight to the spot
where she was held captive.

2:35:33.125 --> 2:35:36.041
She was alive when he reached her.

2:35:40.750 --> 2:35:42.708
Gandhi will deal with his son.

2:35:43.958 --> 2:35:46.333
Shouldn't I handle "my friend"
who killed my daughter?

2:35:55.958 --> 2:35:58.791
Second innings has started
Mumbai is entering the field.

2:35:58.958 --> 2:36:00.083
Chennai openers.

2:36:00.333 --> 2:36:01.958
Ruturaj and Devon Conway.

2:36:02.333 --> 2:36:04.250
Left hand, right hand, Indian, foreign.

2:36:04.333 --> 2:36:06.125
-Superb combination.
-All okay?

2:36:07.333 --> 2:36:08.375
You think we'll win?

2:36:12.208 --> 2:36:14.083
I presume your family is safe?

2:36:19.333 --> 2:36:20.291
Not doing good?

2:37:24.750 --> 2:37:29.041
Close all the gates shut
due to security reasons.

2:37:29.416 --> 2:37:31.583
Until I give further instructions.

2:37:31.791 --> 2:37:33.625
I don't care even if it is any VIP.

2:37:33.750 --> 2:37:35.416
Don't allow anyone inside.

2:37:53.125 --> 2:37:55.291
Correctly, when the match
enters the final over.

2:37:55.833 --> 2:37:58.125
Six galleries to the left will explode.

2:37:58.583 --> 2:38:00.250
So what all of you must do?

2:38:00.333 --> 2:38:02.000
Shift over to the right
before the blast.

2:38:02.583 --> 2:38:04.208
After the bomb blast,

2:38:04.416 --> 2:38:07.500
the audience on the right side
will panic and run helter-skelter.

2:38:07.833 --> 2:38:10.625
We will also run out with them
as if we are also spectators.

2:38:11.791 --> 2:38:13.750
If ransom money is paid
within ten overs,

2:38:14.125 --> 2:38:16.333
Gandhi took the money
and blew up the stadium.

2:38:16.583 --> 2:38:18.416
If money isn't paid up
within ten overs,

2:38:18.708 --> 2:38:20.791
Gandhi blew up the stadium
because he didn't get the money.

2:38:20.916 --> 2:38:21.791
That's all.

2:38:21.958 --> 2:38:22.833
Simple.

2:38:25.416 --> 2:38:26.416
Boss.

2:38:26.625 --> 2:38:29.166
If we don't get the money and
the bomb doesn't explode,

2:38:29.250 --> 2:38:30.791
what to do, boss?

2:38:34.375 --> 2:38:36.041
Hey! Who is he?

2:38:44.458 --> 2:38:46.833
Father of the nation, I say!

2:39:00.083 --> 2:39:02.250
General
Who you know, no comparable

2:39:04.166 --> 2:39:07.166
Who wants war?
Now the curse is incurable

2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:10.791
Fly through the air like a phoenix

2:39:10.875 --> 2:39:12.000
A pinnacle

2:39:18.083 --> 2:39:18.958
Dad?

2:39:19.583 --> 2:39:20.458
Dad…

2:39:26.625 --> 2:39:27.500
Oh, God!

2:39:29.875 --> 2:39:31.291
Hey!

2:39:32.333 --> 2:39:35.333
I can see you are doing
a damn good performance.

2:39:35.750 --> 2:39:37.750
Can't hear you.
I can't hear you.

2:39:38.083 --> 2:39:40.416
Wretched fellow!
Pick up that walkie-talkie.

2:39:47.166 --> 2:39:48.208
What happened, Dad?

2:39:48.500 --> 2:39:49.791
How are you here, Dad?

2:39:50.250 --> 2:39:52.625
You were there.
How did you come here?

2:39:52.750 --> 2:39:54.083
Which "dad" are you asking?

2:39:55.791 --> 2:39:56.666
Me?

2:39:58.250 --> 2:39:59.083
This chap?

2:39:59.166 --> 2:40:01.416
If you lay your finger
on him once more…

2:40:01.500 --> 2:40:02.500
My prodigal son!

2:40:03.041 --> 2:40:04.916
This is your dad's good time.

2:40:05.750 --> 2:40:07.291
I give you two minutes.

2:40:07.833 --> 2:40:10.500
Diffuse the bomb and then
come and stand before me.

2:40:12.125 --> 2:40:13.958
Otherwise, in front of your eyes…

2:40:17.750 --> 2:40:19.291
his head will fly in mid-air.

2:40:19.791 --> 2:40:22.291
Gandhi! Listen to me.

2:40:22.791 --> 2:40:24.625
You will repent this to the fullest.

2:40:25.166 --> 2:40:27.083
Gandhi, you will regret
what you are doing.

2:40:29.375 --> 2:40:32.083
What kind of answer is this
to what I told him to do?

2:40:32.458 --> 2:40:34.458
What a pathetic job of parenting!

2:40:34.541 --> 2:40:35.708
Hey!

2:40:35.791 --> 2:40:37.416
What a lousy upbringing!

2:40:37.500 --> 2:40:38.333
Stop this!

2:40:38.708 --> 2:40:41.500
This is the result of not sending
the boy to school but planting bombs.

2:40:41.583 --> 2:40:42.458
Stop this!

2:40:42.625 --> 2:40:43.958
Tell me, what is it?

2:40:44.083 --> 2:40:45.500
You want to fight?
Come in front of me.

2:40:45.583 --> 2:40:48.166
-Come right in front.
-Am I in some foreign land?!

2:40:48.375 --> 2:40:50.416
Sanjay, don't think of my plight.

2:40:50.958 --> 2:40:52.375
Just hit the button!

2:40:53.833 --> 2:40:55.000
Sanjay?

2:40:55.458 --> 2:40:56.916
His name is Jeevan.

2:40:57.083 --> 2:40:59.458
Hey! I am Sanjay.
Sanjay is my name.

2:40:59.708 --> 2:41:00.750
Oh!

2:41:00.833 --> 2:41:02.208
If you dare harm my dad,

2:41:03.041 --> 2:41:04.708
I swear I won't spare your life.

2:41:05.250 --> 2:41:07.875
He is only throwing words
but not showing them in action!

2:41:07.958 --> 2:41:10.000
Is love so trivial to you?

2:41:11.333 --> 2:41:13.875
Wait and watch,
what I do now.

2:41:19.708 --> 2:41:21.833
Dad!

2:41:23.083 --> 2:41:24.750
Dad!

2:41:24.958 --> 2:41:26.916
Why are you yelling "dad"
like a broken record?

2:41:28.541 --> 2:41:30.625
Whatever you do over there,

2:41:30.875 --> 2:41:32.833
the same will happen to him.

2:41:34.666 --> 2:41:35.791
Jeevan.

2:41:36.958 --> 2:41:38.916
My intention is not to kill him.

2:41:39.083 --> 2:41:40.625
Don't twist my arm!

2:41:41.416 --> 2:41:42.500
Sanjay.

2:41:42.583 --> 2:41:45.875
We've been waiting for many years
for this particular moment.

2:41:46.041 --> 2:41:48.666
-Jeevan, it's over.
-Do not think of me.

2:41:48.791 --> 2:41:52.333
Simply… just hit the button, man.

2:41:52.416 --> 2:41:54.791
Nabbing my dad…
you want to stop this?

2:41:54.958 --> 2:41:56.250
Do you think you can stop me?

2:41:56.333 --> 2:41:57.750
Do you think you can stop me?

2:41:57.916 --> 2:41:59.000
No one can stop me.

2:41:59.125 --> 2:42:01.791
Now, right now,
in front of your eyes,

2:42:01.958 --> 2:42:04.958
I will blast this entire ground, dude.

2:42:05.041 --> 2:42:06.791
Do it, try your luck, do it.

2:42:11.166 --> 2:42:12.333
What are you looking for?

2:42:12.416 --> 2:42:13.583
Detonator?

2:42:15.083 --> 2:42:17.625
Your uncle took it and left, dude.

2:42:22.333 --> 2:42:23.625
Look at the screen.

2:42:26.583 --> 2:42:29.041
In 60 balls, 112 runs.

2:42:29.375 --> 2:42:33.125
-Catch him.
-The real chase starts now.

2:42:47.833 --> 2:42:48.791
Bro?

2:42:49.958 --> 2:42:50.916
One second, bro.

2:42:52.541 --> 2:42:53.583
Bro, one second.

2:42:54.916 --> 2:42:55.833
Fans.

2:42:56.541 --> 2:43:00.208
Like Thalapathy told me, not just kids,
but I've got even adults as my fans now.

2:43:00.416 --> 2:43:01.541
Hey!

2:43:04.125 --> 2:43:06.000
No need for an autograph.
We can take a selfie.

2:43:06.125 --> 2:43:07.000
Bro?

2:43:07.333 --> 2:43:09.458
I'm an officer of
the Special Anti-Terrorism Squad.

2:43:09.583 --> 2:43:11.250
-Nice.
-A bomb has been planted on the ground.

2:43:11.666 --> 2:43:12.541
Bomb?

2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:14.833
Sir, I didn't hear you clearly.

2:43:15.041 --> 2:43:17.375
-Tell me once more.
-I don't have time to repeat.

2:43:17.541 --> 2:43:20.000
He's the head of
the bomb blast group.

2:43:21.250 --> 2:43:23.708
Stay put here and make sure
he doesn't escape, okay?

2:43:24.375 --> 2:43:26.583
Sir, I came to have a jolly time
and enjoy the match.

2:43:26.666 --> 2:43:28.625
You're telling me a story
of a Vijaykanth film?

2:43:29.125 --> 2:43:31.208
Whatever it is, we can
discuss and decide, sir.

2:43:31.291 --> 2:43:33.125
-We can talk it over.
-No time to talk.

2:43:33.333 --> 2:43:36.125
If anyone comes to rescue him,
threaten to shoot him.

2:43:36.416 --> 2:43:39.291
-But don't kill him.
-Sir, one minute.

2:43:39.375 --> 2:43:40.750
Hold the gun, Shiva.

2:43:42.416 --> 2:43:45.375
Thousands of lives on the ground
rest only in your hands now.

2:43:46.583 --> 2:43:47.458
Good luck.

2:43:49.166 --> 2:43:50.250
Sir, one minute.

2:43:51.500 --> 2:43:53.625
I think you're going on
a more important task than this.

2:43:54.166 --> 2:43:55.250
You attend to it, sir.

2:43:55.791 --> 2:43:56.750
I'll handle this.

2:43:57.791 --> 2:43:58.791
Okay?

2:44:01.541 --> 2:44:05.125
CSK has scored 14 runs in the last over.

2:44:05.208 --> 2:44:06.750
They have started their power play.

2:44:06.833 --> 2:44:08.958
They are out to blast whoever bowls.

2:44:09.041 --> 2:44:11.041
The real power play begins.

2:44:11.125 --> 2:44:12.750
Hit it! Fantastic!

2:44:12.833 --> 2:44:13.833
Sixer!

2:44:13.916 --> 2:44:15.916
The ball flew out of the stadium.

2:44:16.083 --> 2:44:18.958
It no longer matters
who the bowler is hereafter.

2:44:19.416 --> 2:44:22.916
The ball will fly out of the field
into the stand, and all eyes over there.

2:44:34.041 --> 2:44:35.250
He did it! Sixer!

2:44:35.833 --> 2:44:38.750
His name needs to be changed.
He isn't Shivam Dube anymore.

2:44:38.833 --> 2:44:40.625
-He is Sixer Dube!
-Look there.

2:44:40.791 --> 2:44:43.375
Numbers one to four don't
feature in his syllabus.

2:44:43.458 --> 2:44:46.250
Straight six only. He aced it.

2:44:46.333 --> 2:44:49.708
He is the ruling God
in this middle-overs phase.

2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:50.875
He is rocking.

2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:54.333
-What are you doing here?
-Oh no! Uncle!

2:44:57.625 --> 2:44:58.875
Faster!

2:45:06.125 --> 2:45:07.000
Hey, bro!

2:45:07.833 --> 2:45:10.041
Cheenu, I was looking for you
all over the place.

2:45:12.125 --> 2:45:12.958
Oh no!

2:45:13.041 --> 2:45:14.750
Mental Uncle, there you are?

2:45:14.833 --> 2:45:15.708
Oh God!

2:45:16.041 --> 2:45:16.875
Bro!

2:45:33.958 --> 2:45:34.875
Give me the detonator.

2:45:35.166 --> 2:45:36.458
What? Detonator?

2:45:36.666 --> 2:45:38.000
Didn't Jeevitha give it to you?

2:45:39.083 --> 2:45:40.083
No worries, bro.

2:45:40.541 --> 2:45:42.041
Jeevan's men were chasing me, right?

2:45:42.125 --> 2:45:43.500
Jeevitha was watching the match.

2:45:43.583 --> 2:45:46.166
I got a brilliant idea.
I told her to give it to you.

2:45:46.250 --> 2:45:47.875
I diverted all the villains.

2:45:49.333 --> 2:45:51.208
Jeevitha… match?

2:45:51.291 --> 2:45:52.916
Please, Uncle.
Don't tell anyone at home.

2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:55.416
I won't tell anyone.
Give this to your dad.

2:45:56.666 --> 2:45:57.833
Is my dad here too?

2:45:57.916 --> 2:45:59.041
Even your brother is here.

2:45:59.375 --> 2:46:00.208
I'm dead meat!

2:46:00.791 --> 2:46:03.541
If you don't hand this to your dad
all of us here are as good as dead!

2:46:03.708 --> 2:46:05.541
-Oh no!
-CSK vs. MI.

2:46:05.625 --> 2:46:07.750
As each ball decreases,

2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.791
-it is like the countdown of a time bomb.
-How did you get this?

2:46:10.875 --> 2:46:12.333
-Give it to me.
-Heart rate escalates.

2:46:12.416 --> 2:46:13.500
Are you mad or what?

2:46:13.666 --> 2:46:16.458
No one else knows I gave her
the detonator, except you and me.

2:46:16.541 --> 2:46:18.000
Sanjay, Gandhi's daughter
has the detonator

2:46:18.083 --> 2:46:19.333
and is running in gallery three.

2:46:19.666 --> 2:46:20.500
Catch her, quick.

2:46:28.208 --> 2:46:31.916
Heartbeat, this is heartbeat
With the right route it is a treat

2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:37.916
Beats this heartbeat
With the right route it's a feast

2:46:39.583 --> 2:46:42.416
At the end of 16 overs,
CSK is 148 for four.

2:46:42.500 --> 2:46:46.416
Now CSK has to score 58 runs
in the remaining 24 balls.

2:46:46.666 --> 2:46:48.583
Strategic time-out is coming to an end.

2:46:49.125 --> 2:46:50.291
Count down begins.

2:46:50.375 --> 2:46:51.291
Five.

2:46:51.500 --> 2:46:52.458
Four.

2:46:52.625 --> 2:46:53.541
Three.

2:46:53.750 --> 2:46:54.708
Two.

2:46:54.875 --> 2:46:55.708
One.

2:46:55.791 --> 2:46:57.250
Chennai vs. Mumbai.

2:46:57.333 --> 2:46:59.208
The final battle starts now.

2:47:01.291 --> 2:47:02.958
Who is he?
He made me go dizzy

2:47:03.041 --> 2:47:06.916
In my heart and mind he snuggled
Endearing like a baby he prattled

2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:08.083
Love unlimited

2:47:08.166 --> 2:47:10.666
Who is he?
He made me tipsy

2:47:10.750 --> 2:47:14.541
He made my youth terrific
Like the first drizzle of love magic

2:47:14.625 --> 2:47:16.375
My true Valentine

2:47:16.541 --> 2:47:18.500
My heartthrob makes my heart race

2:47:18.583 --> 2:47:20.416
My love sublime

2:47:20.500 --> 2:47:22.375
Lub-dub, luv-duv always

2:47:22.458 --> 2:47:26.250
My forever true love
She wafted into my life now…

2:47:33.416 --> 2:47:35.208
Fiery shot! Is it a four?

2:47:35.291 --> 2:47:36.833
No, the Mumbai fielder is right there.

2:47:37.166 --> 2:47:39.666
Mumbai fielders are all over the place.

2:47:40.833 --> 2:47:42.458
Sanjay, I've spotted Gandhi.

2:47:42.625 --> 2:47:43.666
I'll stop him.

2:47:43.791 --> 2:47:44.916
You get the girl.

2:47:47.666 --> 2:47:49.083
Lovely shot! Towards the cover.

2:47:49.166 --> 2:47:51.250
All the way to the boundary?
Or is it a single again?

2:47:51.375 --> 2:47:53.458
CSK can't win taking these singles.

2:47:53.541 --> 2:47:55.666
We need some special force!

2:47:58.000 --> 2:47:59.833
The greatest of all time

2:47:59.916 --> 2:48:02.875
A man of lies, of disguise
Can you see it in my eyes?

2:48:02.958 --> 2:48:04.333
The greatest of all time

2:48:04.416 --> 2:48:07.291
An agent, with a secret
A soldier, the deepest

2:48:07.375 --> 2:48:08.791
A father to a family

2:48:08.875 --> 2:48:10.541
The greatest, come follow me

2:48:14.500 --> 2:48:18.250
I used to live in the struggle
But now I live in luxury

2:48:18.333 --> 2:48:21.291
With champagne bottles poppin'
Models all around me

2:48:21.375 --> 2:48:24.041
My hustle never stoppin'
My grind it never seizes

2:48:24.125 --> 2:48:27.458
Now livin' the life
That most people can't believe

2:48:29.041 --> 2:48:31.250
The match has reached
the height of climax.

2:48:31.500 --> 2:48:33.916
In two overs, 28 runs needed.

2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:35.875
For CSK to win this match.

2:48:43.916 --> 2:48:46.041
Trust me, I have played with
Mahendra Singh Dhoni for many years.

2:48:46.125 --> 2:48:49.458
If he wears his helmet,
it signifies he's the next batsman.

2:48:51.291 --> 2:48:53.791
Another CSK wicket. Howzat!

2:48:53.875 --> 2:48:58.458
If you are wondering why CSK fans
are in a celebrating mood.

2:48:58.541 --> 2:49:00.625
Stadium is scorching
in this sizzling suspense.

2:49:00.708 --> 2:49:02.208
Decibel level here is at its peak.

2:49:02.291 --> 2:49:05.541
We can't even hear our own voice.

2:49:05.625 --> 2:49:08.041
Because it is the entry
of none other than.

2:49:08.125 --> 2:49:09.666
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

2:49:20.125 --> 2:49:22.375
Even if a nuclear bomb explodes now,

2:49:22.458 --> 2:49:25.958
only the name, "Dhoni" will reverberate.

2:49:38.958 --> 2:49:40.875
Hard length delivery.
He has tackled with ease.

2:49:40.958 --> 2:49:42.333
Towards square leg. One run.

2:49:42.416 --> 2:49:43.250
Dad.

2:50:05.208 --> 2:50:07.500
Dad.

2:50:09.791 --> 2:50:10.666
Twentieth over.

2:50:11.083 --> 2:50:13.416
Eighteen runs are needed
in this last over.

2:50:13.875 --> 2:50:15.625
-In this nail-biting finish…
-Dad.

2:50:15.708 --> 2:50:18.583
If you want one cricketer
to win this game.

2:50:18.666 --> 2:50:21.333
That is no one else
but Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

2:50:23.166 --> 2:50:24.125
Dad!

2:50:26.166 --> 2:50:27.916
Mahendra Singh Dhoni is on strike.

2:50:32.250 --> 2:50:33.375
He hit a sixer.

2:50:33.666 --> 2:50:34.500
Down the ground.

2:50:34.583 --> 2:50:38.541
Even the most experienced bowler
when bowling to Mahendra Singh Dhoni…

2:50:38.625 --> 2:50:40.000
His hands will be slightly paralyzed!

2:50:40.166 --> 2:50:42.708
We may say this match is
now on a knife-edge finish.

2:50:42.791 --> 2:50:44.000
Not on the tip of a knife.

2:50:44.083 --> 2:50:47.166
This contest is in the hands of Dhoni.

2:50:47.458 --> 2:50:49.291
M.S. vs. Mumbai.

2:50:49.708 --> 2:50:52.291
Twelve runs required in five balls.

2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:14.958
Dot ball.

2:51:15.291 --> 2:51:18.291
A dot ball at this time
is worth its weight in gold.

2:51:18.375 --> 2:51:21.916
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.
Trusted idol of millions of fans.

2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.041
The firm faith of all CSK fans.

2:51:24.166 --> 2:51:27.208
Dhoni, the fate of this match
is sealed only in your hands.

2:51:38.666 --> 2:51:39.958
Dhoni found a gap.

2:51:40.375 --> 2:51:41.958
Oldest player in this League.

2:51:42.166 --> 2:51:44.583
But his energy and speed
did not slacken one bit.

2:51:44.833 --> 2:51:46.625
He has taken two runs
with effortless ease.

2:51:56.208 --> 2:51:58.291
Fielder is running.
But is there hope for two runs?

2:51:58.375 --> 2:51:59.666
Both of them are running.

2:51:59.750 --> 2:52:00.875
Jadeja is running.

2:52:01.250 --> 2:52:03.083
Sacrifice is the essence of team spirit.

2:52:03.166 --> 2:52:04.958
Jadeja has lost his wicket.

2:52:05.041 --> 2:52:06.166
Run out.

2:52:06.541 --> 2:52:11.041
Good news is Mahendra Singh Dhoni
retains the strike in the last ball.

2:52:11.416 --> 2:52:13.666
Five runs are needed in the last ball.

2:52:25.791 --> 2:52:27.416
Bloody old…

2:52:29.458 --> 2:52:30.541
Dad!

2:52:33.583 --> 2:52:35.458
-What is this, huh?
-Dad!

2:52:35.541 --> 2:52:36.375
What?

2:52:37.458 --> 2:52:39.250
Why are you yelling "dad"
like a broken record?!

2:53:21.791 --> 2:53:23.833
Don't, brother.

2:53:33.583 --> 2:53:34.583
Jeevan.

2:53:34.875 --> 2:53:36.333
Hand over the detonator.

2:53:36.916 --> 2:53:37.833
Don't, brother.

2:53:37.916 --> 2:53:40.791
Don't hurt her.
Jeevan, let her go.

2:53:40.875 --> 2:53:44.291
If you want her to live,
give me that detonator.

2:53:44.375 --> 2:53:45.458
-Don't hurt me, brother.
-Jeevan.

2:53:46.875 --> 2:53:48.125
Don't talk rubbish.

2:53:48.208 --> 2:53:49.666
You are piling up your misdeeds.

2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:51.500
Brother, don't hurt me, please.

2:53:51.916 --> 2:53:53.125
-Please.
-I'm telling you even now.

2:53:54.291 --> 2:53:55.250
Release her.

2:53:56.458 --> 2:53:57.333
We can talk it over.

2:53:58.041 --> 2:53:58.958
As if we will talk!

2:53:59.500 --> 2:54:00.333
Give it!

2:54:03.291 --> 2:54:04.166
Jeevan.

2:54:05.791 --> 2:54:07.541
You badly wanted a younger sister.

2:54:07.625 --> 2:54:09.125
How do you have
the heart to kill her?

2:54:11.250 --> 2:54:13.916
I don't know what
Menon has poisoned you with.

2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:15.333
I suspected so many fellows.

2:54:15.416 --> 2:54:17.208
But I didn't suspect
my own flesh and blood.

2:54:17.291 --> 2:54:19.458
I had full faith you wouldn't
have stooped so low.

2:54:22.333 --> 2:54:23.416
Hey! She…

2:54:23.583 --> 2:54:24.958
She shares your genes.

2:54:25.583 --> 2:54:26.958
Let her go, please.

2:54:29.916 --> 2:54:31.125
Who the hell is he?

2:54:33.541 --> 2:54:34.541
Hey, boomer!

2:54:35.125 --> 2:54:37.000
Why do you talk so disgustingly?

2:54:37.666 --> 2:54:38.583
Cringe!

2:54:38.958 --> 2:54:39.833
Give it to me.

2:54:44.375 --> 2:54:45.541
Jeevitha.

2:54:46.416 --> 2:54:47.625
Whose fan are you?

2:54:48.958 --> 2:54:49.791
Dad?

2:54:50.750 --> 2:54:52.583
Answer my question.
Whose fan are you?

2:54:56.166 --> 2:54:57.750
-Thala…
-Hey!

2:54:59.041 --> 2:55:00.541
Are you both playing the fool?

2:55:27.625 --> 2:55:29.500
One ball, five runs to win.

2:55:32.750 --> 2:55:34.708
Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit a six.

2:55:34.791 --> 2:55:37.500
Age is just a number.
A lion is always a lion.

2:55:37.875 --> 2:55:39.875
Once again he proves that he is.

2:55:40.166 --> 2:55:42.541
The greatest of all time.

2:56:17.333 --> 2:56:18.750
What do you lack?
You're "Top Star".

2:56:27.500 --> 2:56:28.541
The mission is on.

2:57:13.500 --> 2:57:15.333
G.O.A.T!

2:57:17.166 --> 2:57:19.000
G.O.A.T!

2:57:19.083 --> 2:57:20.666
You're talking to a real G.O.A.T

2:57:21.125 --> 2:57:23.166
The V-I-J-A-Y

2:57:23.250 --> 2:57:24.708
Youngblood with guts and grit

2:57:26.458 --> 2:57:28.416
A gene to inherit

2:57:28.708 --> 2:57:30.750
The V-I-J-A-Y

2:57:30.833 --> 2:57:31.666
Brilliant!

2:57:33.791 --> 2:57:35.833
Commander, people's favorite

2:57:38.666 --> 2:57:40.083
You're good to go, Jeevan.

2:57:41.375 --> 2:57:42.666
Let me know when, Sanjay.

2:57:47.083 --> 2:57:47.916
I'll tell you.

2:57:48.750 --> 2:57:50.000
You just keep at it.

2:57:50.750 --> 2:57:52.625
The V-I-J-A-Y

2:57:52.708 --> 2:57:54.333
Young General, firm and fit

2:57:56.000 --> 2:57:58.125
A gene to inherit

2:57:58.208 --> 2:58:00.083
The V-I-J-A-Y

2:58:00.166 --> 2:58:01.666
Ilaya Thalapathy

2:58:03.375 --> 2:58:05.375
Thalapathy

2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:21.250
G.O.A.T!

2:58:27.375 --> 2:58:28.708
G.O.A.T!

2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:37.291
The game is over.

2:58:38.375 --> 2:58:40.833
But only when I say it's over!

2:58:47.791 --> 2:58:49.041
Ready? Roll camera!

2:58:56.416 --> 2:58:57.958
I think he is trying to get some bloopers.

2:59:01.125 --> 2:59:02.708
I can see through it.

2:59:02.791 --> 2:59:05.791
Did I ask you for 100 helicopters? I just
asked you for one, just one, please.

2:59:06.250 --> 2:59:07.833
-No chance!
-Sir is calling.

2:59:07.916 --> 2:59:09.416
He is so insistent.
Just say yes, or no?

2:59:09.583 --> 2:59:11.208
Don't say your dad will yell,
your uncle won't approve.

2:59:12.833 --> 2:59:13.958
Start music.

2:59:27.666 --> 2:59:29.416
Ready, taking.
Action.

2:59:29.541 --> 2:59:31.666
Doctor, save me!

2:59:45.500 --> 2:59:46.375
Cut!

2:59:48.083 --> 2:59:50.500
Let's go for the bloopers.

2:59:50.583 --> 2:59:51.791
You guys planned it already?

2:59:53.416 --> 2:59:55.750
What? Shall I smack his face?

2:59:59.958 --> 3:00:00.833
Dad!

3:00:07.208 --> 3:00:10.208
My hands are shivering.
Wonder how our DOP will manage.

3:00:10.291 --> 3:00:11.125
Ready?

3:00:11.208 --> 3:00:12.375
Okay, camera.

3:00:39.625 --> 3:00:41.416
Ready? Camera. Action!

3:00:41.541 --> 3:00:42.458
Action!

3:01:04.041 --> 3:01:06.333
2024!

3:01:06.583 --> 3:01:08.708
This year is also ours!

3:01:09.333 --> 3:01:11.625

WEBVTT

04:47.542 --> 04:49.375
SEVERAL CENTRIES AGO

04:53.042 --> 04:55.642
THE QUINTET ISLETS

05:18.958 --> 05:24.208
Many, many mysteries lie scattered
in this island we live in.

05:25.208 --> 05:29.166
But the most baffling mystery
of them all...

05:29.291 --> 05:30.958
...are the lives of its people.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.749
When something transpires...

05:33.874 --> 05:40.824
...all we know is the how, the where,
and the who.

05:41.249 --> 05:45.458
But no one knows why it transpired.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.791
'Why are you born to someone?'

05:49.916 --> 05:51.958
'Why are you with someone?'

05:52.083 --> 05:53.983
'Why do you die for someone?'

05:54.191 --> 05:56.291
Nobody knows the answers
to these questions.

05:56.491 --> 05:57.999
Nobody knows?

05:59.983 --> 06:02.666
Standing far away upon the sky...

06:02.791 --> 06:04.624
Shrouded in mysteries...

06:04.749 --> 06:07.958
She who watches this world
with her silent gaze...

06:08.083 --> 06:09.333
The moon!

06:11.541 --> 06:15.458
Only she and she alone
has the answers to all the questions.

06:33.666 --> 06:37.916
'Child's Brain Power Amplification
is now 75% complete. '

06:39.499 --> 06:41.333
'Activating Memory Zone. '

06:41.458 --> 06:43.458
'Child's Brain Mapping in progress. '

06:44.833 --> 06:46.708
'Extracting Brain Schematics. '

06:46.833 --> 06:49.624
'Super Powering 35% complete. '

06:49.749 --> 06:51.624
'Child's Brain Formatting completed. '

06:51.749 --> 06:53.291
'Altering Neuro Links. '

07:12.166 --> 07:13.291
Charge!

07:13.416 --> 07:14.541
Zeta has escaped!

07:14.666 --> 07:16.166
East gate breached!

07:16.291 --> 07:17.374
Get him!

07:17.499 --> 07:20.166
Got a runner from the facility.
Lock down the perimeter!

07:23.041 --> 07:24.666
Spread out and snag the kid!

07:26.041 --> 07:28.333
Crap!
Can't let him slip away!

07:28.458 --> 07:31.416
Move, move, move!
-Pick up the pace, slowpokes!

07:32.583 --> 07:34.208
Ground squad!
Go! Go! Go!

08:04.791 --> 08:06.583
He's booking south!
Neuro locking him!

08:26.333 --> 08:28.041
Crap!
Where the hell is Zeta?

08:28.708 --> 08:31.416
Break off and box him in!
Go! Go! Go!

08:54.374 --> 08:56.041
"O warrior"

08:58.874 --> 09:00.833
"You march forth like an army"

09:03.999 --> 09:05.624
"O warrior"

09:05.749 --> 09:08.124
"You march forth like an army"

09:08.249 --> 09:10.791
"Are you the foundation
of infinite valor?"

09:10.916 --> 09:12.791
"Are you but one man, or a hundred?"

09:38.124 --> 09:40.249
Hi, Commish!
How you doin'?

09:40.374 --> 09:42.624
You're really pushing it, man!

09:42.749 --> 09:46.916
I offered you a bounty to capture
De Souza! What are you doing there?

09:47.041 --> 09:51.499
An object weighs half as much in water
than it does on land, says Archimedes.

09:51.624 --> 09:55.041
I wanted to put the theory to test,
but the chick is too shy, Commish!

09:55.166 --> 09:57.124
Hey, Mosto!
Shall I come there?

09:57.249 --> 09:59.708
Why? You pissed at me
for diving in without you?

10:01.708 --> 10:02.958
We caught De Souza!

10:03.583 --> 10:06.166
What is your partner Francis up to?
Tell me, dude!

10:06.291 --> 10:09.708
It'll be super trippy
if I tell you that with a song!

10:09.833 --> 10:12.708
Alexa!
Play 'Macho'!

10:13.874 --> 10:16.291
Menacing music!

10:16.416 --> 10:17.833
[playing music]

10:18.258 --> 10:20.883
De Souza's bodyguards intervened
when we came to get him.

10:21.008 --> 10:23.258
Francis is getting a workout with them,
Commish!

10:28.299 --> 10:29.716
Now? Shoulder press!

10:33.466 --> 10:34.466
Biceps!

10:37.008 --> 10:38.383
Next?
Bench press!

10:41.674 --> 10:43.049
What you all do?
A shower bath.

10:43.591 --> 10:45.591
What Francis does?
A power bath!

10:53.216 --> 10:55.258
Francis!
Take your chain!

10:59.133 --> 11:01.424
Why is he ignoring 'Baby'?
No wait! He sees her!

11:02.091 --> 11:03.091
Francis!

11:40.508 --> 11:41.508
Catch!

11:57.608 --> 11:59.649
No disappointment.
You'll get your share too!

11:59.774 --> 12:01.191
Pinky!

12:01.316 --> 12:02.524
Hello, Commish?
-Yes, Colt?

12:02.649 --> 12:03.649
Completed!

12:06.441 --> 12:08.816
Why did you abduct me? Who are you two?
-I don't know!

12:08.941 --> 12:10.441
Police?
-What an insult!

12:10.566 --> 12:11.816
Narcotics?

12:14.191 --> 12:15.441
We are bounty hunters!

12:15.566 --> 12:16.691
Meaning?
-Hey, baldie!

12:16.816 --> 12:19.483
Like when kids take private tutoring
despite going to school!

12:19.608 --> 12:22.983
Hunters, who catch criminals for the cops,
whom even they can't catch!

12:23.108 --> 12:24.108
Bloody baldie!

12:41.291 --> 12:43.249
Hi!
-Shut up your mouth!

12:43.999 --> 12:45.249
Get moving, Colt!

12:47.566 --> 12:48.733
Hi!

12:48.858 --> 12:49.899
No!

12:50.608 --> 12:51.649
Francis!

12:52.774 --> 12:54.024
Stay put, baldie!

12:55.191 --> 12:56.320
Francis...

12:57.433 --> 12:59.516
Francis! No!

13:08.683 --> 13:10.849
Yeah!
The De Souza chap you asked for!

13:10.974 --> 13:13.058
Give me the bounty of 500 grand!
-Commissioner!

13:13.183 --> 13:14.724
Give me the five hundred grand!

13:16.091 --> 13:17.341
I'm the one who caught him!

13:17.983 --> 13:19.416
I'm the one who finished it!

13:19.624 --> 13:21.249
In that case, split the bounty!

13:21.449 --> 13:22.604
What?
-What?

13:22.729 --> 13:25.979
I wouldn't share the air I breathe
with her! Expect me to share the bounty?

13:26.104 --> 13:28.188
I'll never share my money
with this riffraff!

13:33.246 --> 13:34.954
Commander!
We've got Zeta!

13:35.079 --> 13:38.329
The one that escaped.
We picked up his brain signal in Goa!

13:48.454 --> 13:49.621
Victorious!

13:51.538 --> 13:55.413
Acquire Zeta's brain schematics
and bring his head.

13:57.038 --> 13:59.954
Commander!
Zeta's been locked up here since birth.

14:00.079 --> 14:03.204
He doesn't know a soul outside.
Who's he after in Goa?

14:05.204 --> 14:07.371
You only know his story...

14:08.788 --> 14:10.621
...from the day he was made.

14:12.413 --> 14:14.413
His brain is not programmed...

14:15.371 --> 14:17.121
...to live without a reason.

14:18.329 --> 14:21.496
So who's he after in Goa?

14:22.663 --> 14:25.329
Tell Commish he'll have Jittu in an hour!
-On it!

14:33.038 --> 14:34.413
Your labored breathing...

14:34.538 --> 14:39.413
...is packed with jealousy, helplessness,
resentment, hatred, frustration, and anger!

14:39.638 --> 14:41.138
What exactly are you looking at?

14:43.971 --> 14:45.346
God damn it, Jittu!

14:45.471 --> 14:47.763
When we're cold,
all we do is sleep under a bedspread!

14:47.888 --> 14:49.846
What a spread he's sleeping under!

14:49.971 --> 14:52.304
I'm going to copy your expression,
Francis!

14:57.013 --> 14:58.346
Sleeping beauties!

14:59.013 --> 15:00.138
Get up!

15:00.263 --> 15:01.638
Get your leg off his face!

15:02.429 --> 15:04.638
This girl alone isn't
getting off, Francis!

15:04.763 --> 15:06.429
She's crazy about him!

15:06.554 --> 15:08.429
Colt!
That's his hand, man!

15:09.263 --> 15:11.846
True that! Bloody...
-Hey, baby! Join us!

15:11.971 --> 15:13.471
Hey, baby?

15:15.596 --> 15:18.304
Mossberg!
Caliber: 12 gauge. Made in USA.

15:18.429 --> 15:21.138
Francis! Get over here!
Get me this gun!

15:21.263 --> 15:22.929
Please! I love this gun!
-Hey! No!

15:23.054 --> 15:24.263
Get me this gun!
-My finger!

15:24.388 --> 15:26.096
Get it for me, Francis!
-No! Colt!

15:26.221 --> 15:27.221
Get me the gun!

15:27.346 --> 15:28.346
Okay! You can have it!

15:31.013 --> 15:32.804
Francis!

15:35.346 --> 15:39.471
Since birth, I have begged and pleaded
with you for so many things!

15:39.596 --> 15:41.596
You've never done anything for me.
-Well...

15:41.721 --> 15:45.096
But for the first time, when I yelled,
you got me this gun.

15:45.221 --> 15:46.263
Why, buddy?

15:53.179 --> 15:55.971
This crooked face laughter
means someone's getting screwed!

15:56.096 --> 15:57.179
Now...

15:57.304 --> 15:59.221
Who's getting screwed now?

15:59.346 --> 16:00.846
Me?
How?

16:02.596 --> 16:04.054
There's blood on Jittu's chest!

16:04.179 --> 16:06.513
'Even if a small scratch
falls on Jittu... '

16:06.638 --> 16:09.188
'... his brother Kambutta
will rip you to shreds!'

16:09.393 --> 16:10.433
Holy cow!

16:10.746 --> 16:12.410
Nobody saw the shootout, darling.

16:12.629 --> 16:14.338
Sleeping beauties are still dreaming!

16:14.463 --> 16:16.129
If we silently waltzed away...

16:25.579 --> 16:28.288
Think he saw it?
-I'm confident he didn't.

16:29.246 --> 16:31.454
Build a shoulder bridge!

16:32.663 --> 16:33.996
What a huge ship!

16:43.788 --> 16:44.829
Go! Go! Go!
Let's go!

17:05.004 --> 17:08.963
Bestie! Jittu and Francis
are both in that yacht!

17:09.088 --> 17:11.379
You've been hanging out with me
for a week, bestie!

17:11.504 --> 17:14.129
How'd you find out where they were?
-That's my secret!

17:14.254 --> 17:15.338
Cool!

17:17.990 --> 17:19.354
Come!
-Francis!

17:19.479 --> 17:21.221
My son!
-Hey, kid!

17:21.421 --> 17:22.586
Draw well, kid!

17:22.786 --> 17:26.104
In your fingertips, lies the information
about Jittu's killers!

17:27.154 --> 17:28.279
Beautiful, Francis.

17:28.504 --> 17:30.321
Why does this only happen to you?

17:30.446 --> 17:31.821
God is great!

17:32.571 --> 17:33.821
I'm out of here!

17:35.071 --> 17:36.488
Look at that!

17:36.613 --> 17:37.696
Look where?

17:39.846 --> 17:40.903
Attack!

17:41.841 --> 17:43.591
Damn you!
Francis got the boy!

17:59.566 --> 18:00.775
Don't look at me like that.

18:04.525 --> 18:05.733
Don't look at me like that!

18:06.691 --> 18:08.066
Something's happening within!

18:08.191 --> 18:09.983
Colt! Tell him to not look at me
like that!

18:10.108 --> 18:12.400
Let it go!
He already saw you kill someone!

18:12.525 --> 18:14.191
Why can't he see you drive a car?

18:15.858 --> 18:18.816
Look that side!
Don't look at me, I say!

18:20.650 --> 18:22.650
Hey!
Hey, kiddo!

18:24.108 --> 18:26.816
What's wrong, kiddo? Look at me!
-What did you do?

18:26.941 --> 18:28.358
I didn't do anything!

18:28.483 --> 18:30.066
Go to the hospital!
-Got it!

18:30.191 --> 18:31.566
It's okay, kiddo!

18:31.691 --> 18:33.400
Let's go!
-Okay. Watch him!

18:33.525 --> 18:34.816
Hey, kiddo!

18:53.066 --> 18:54.566
This is not normal.

18:55.775 --> 18:57.275
The nerve...

18:57.400 --> 18:58.816
Repeat the test once more.

19:05.233 --> 19:06.858
Listen to me, Francis.

19:06.983 --> 19:08.275
Let the doctor handle the kid.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.775
Let's scoot!

19:09.900 --> 19:11.191
No, darling.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.816
I can't leave the kid behind.

19:12.941 --> 19:15.358
Why?
-Something's stopping me.

19:15.483 --> 19:16.608
Stopping you?

19:18.566 --> 19:21.066
This wheelchair is what's stopping you!
Let's go!

19:21.191 --> 19:22.316
Doctor's calling you, sir!

19:22.858 --> 19:25.691
Did this boy have a head injury
before this?

19:25.816 --> 19:26.983
We don't know, ma'am.

19:27.108 --> 19:28.608
He just twisted his neck a bit!

19:29.150 --> 19:30.525
It's strange...

19:30.650 --> 19:33.108
The boy caught us playing PUBG.

19:33.233 --> 19:34.900
Gunfire and stuff.

19:35.025 --> 19:37.275
Did he say anything about that?
-No. Not at all.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.691
Then proceed with treatment.

19:38.816 --> 19:42.025
In my 25 years of experience
as a radiologist...

19:42.150 --> 19:43.900
...I've never seen something like this.

19:44.025 --> 19:47.650
The boy's head was opened up
for some kind of surgery.

19:47.775 --> 19:48.858
It's odd.

19:50.233 --> 19:52.983
Look at this.
Plenty of abnormalities in the brain.

19:54.358 --> 19:57.066
Something is altering the brain cells.

19:59.191 --> 20:02.191
I'll send all these reports
to the chief neurologist.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.400
The boy is stable now.

20:05.233 --> 20:07.566
Bring him back tomorrow morning,
for sure.

20:07.691 --> 20:08.691
Okay, doctor.

20:15.654 --> 20:17.279
The phone is ringing, Francis.

20:20.987 --> 20:24.362
We got CCTV footage from the area
near the yacht where Jittu was murdered.

20:25.029 --> 20:27.612
You, Colt and a little boy
were seen there.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.445
Don't worry.
I've erased it.

20:30.570 --> 20:33.779
But Kambutta's aware
the boy is a witness.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.654
Be careful.

20:35.779 --> 20:38.112
Take cover, Francis!

20:54.070 --> 20:55.070
Are you okay?

21:03.654 --> 21:04.654
Where to, buddy?

21:08.570 --> 21:11.445
I get a strange feeling
whenever I see that kid, darling.

21:11.570 --> 21:14.945
I've had the same feeling
since I saw the kid at Angela's house.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.195
It's fear!

21:17.320 --> 21:19.654
Who is this kid?
Where did he come from?

21:20.404 --> 21:21.945
What is his problem?

21:22.529 --> 21:23.862
Why does he look at me
like that?

21:23.987 --> 21:25.529
Come, let's ask him ourselves!

21:28.195 --> 21:29.279
Where'd he go?

21:41.320 --> 21:42.987
"O warrior"

21:45.612 --> 21:47.820
"You march forth like an army"

21:50.820 --> 21:52.487
"O warrior"

21:52.612 --> 21:55.279
"You march forth like an army"

21:55.404 --> 21:57.820
"Are you the foundation
of infinite valor?"

21:57.945 --> 21:59.779
"Are you but one man, or a hundred?"

23:00.487 --> 23:01.862
Wh... what is it?

23:01.987 --> 23:02.987
What's wrong?

23:03.737 --> 23:04.904
What's wrong, kiddo?

23:05.029 --> 23:06.612
Why do you keep doing this?

23:07.779 --> 23:08.779
Are you hungry?

23:10.154 --> 23:11.404
Want to eat?

23:13.070 --> 23:14.070
Colt!

23:15.820 --> 23:17.112
Eat.

23:21.529 --> 23:22.987
You eat!

23:27.445 --> 23:29.029
Thank God, Francis!
I found you!

23:29.154 --> 23:30.987
I'm so relieved.
-I'm shocked!

23:31.112 --> 23:32.362
How did you know
we're here?

23:32.487 --> 23:34.237
How do you keep finding us?
Tell me!

23:34.362 --> 23:37.695
I'll tell you later! Someone told Kambutta
you're here! Let's go!

23:37.820 --> 23:39.529
Cut the BS, Angela.

23:39.654 --> 23:40.695
I don't believe you.

23:41.570 --> 23:44.195
Trust me, babe.
I'm here to save you!

23:44.395 --> 23:46.729
I could feel love in the (h)air...

23:47.770 --> 23:48.770
How cringeworthy!

23:50.562 --> 23:52.479
Thought I had a chance
as they had broken up!

23:57.062 --> 23:58.062
Yes!

24:00.020 --> 24:01.520
Angela, no!
-You thought you had me!

24:01.645 --> 24:03.312
What a twist, Bestie!

24:04.729 --> 24:07.520
That last thing you said...
Say it again!

24:07.645 --> 24:10.020
I could feel love in the (h)air...

24:10.145 --> 24:11.145
Bloody!

24:11.270 --> 24:12.812
Revenge is in the air, baby!

24:14.020 --> 24:16.812
You asked how I keep finding you, yes?
-Yes.

24:16.937 --> 24:18.770
The break up gift I gave?

24:18.895 --> 24:20.104
This right here!

24:20.229 --> 24:22.520
This?
-The pendant is a tracker!

24:23.437 --> 24:24.437
A tracker?

24:24.562 --> 24:26.270
Yes!
-He's glaring at me!

24:29.645 --> 24:31.895
Angela deceived us, Francis!

24:32.645 --> 24:34.520
Kambutta's here!
You guys are busted!

24:38.562 --> 24:40.770
Kambutta!
Ask this kid who killed your brother!

24:41.729 --> 24:43.979
(Hindi) Did you see who killed my brother?
Tell me!

24:44.104 --> 24:45.812
(Hindi) Tell me who did it!
-Careful!

24:45.937 --> 24:46.937
(Hindi) Tell me!

24:50.854 --> 24:52.062
Kambutta!
I...

25:03.187 --> 25:04.812
Guys...
What's happening here?

25:22.979 --> 25:24.187
Move, move, move!

25:30.254 --> 25:31.379
Neural lock!

25:49.920 --> 25:51.045
Cover the left flank!

25:57.170 --> 25:58.545
Get down!
Hide!

26:09.570 --> 26:10.570
Fire!

26:12.529 --> 26:13.737
Kiddo!

26:13.862 --> 26:16.029
Get down! Hide! Get back!

26:18.987 --> 26:20.029
Stay there!

26:20.462 --> 26:21.629
Stay!
-Careful!

26:22.545 --> 26:23.879
Francis!

26:25.230 --> 26:26.249
Are you okay?

26:38.600 --> 26:39.850
Burned ten already!

26:49.350 --> 26:50.559
Hey!
Just leave him!

26:51.559 --> 26:52.809
Don't hurt him!

26:54.767 --> 26:56.934
No! Don't!

27:06.017 --> 27:07.100
Zeta secured!

27:13.017 --> 27:14.017
Move it!

27:21.475 --> 27:22.559
Zeta locked!

27:22.684 --> 27:23.892
We are on our way!

27:27.642 --> 27:30.059
Alright. Move Zeta
to the transport facility now.

27:30.184 --> 27:31.350
Copy that? Over.

28:08.850 --> 28:12.809
Aurelius Dorca the Second,
the emperor of the Roman empire...

28:12.934 --> 28:16.100
...and his 25,000 Roman soldiers
had set up camp in the mighty seas...

28:16.225 --> 28:20.184
...to lay siege
on the Indian subcontinent.

28:20.309 --> 28:23.100
To rest, to strategize...

28:23.225 --> 28:27.309
...and to train his soldiers in warfare,
he needed a huge piece of land.

28:27.434 --> 28:29.975
The five islands
caught his eye.

28:30.809 --> 28:34.017
Land adjacent but not contiguous
with the Indian subcontinent.

28:34.142 --> 28:38.142
Mandaiyaaru, Vengaadu, Mukkaadu,
Arathi and Perumaachi.

28:38.267 --> 28:41.225
Collectively, they were known as
'The Quintet Islets'.

28:41.350 --> 28:42.600
The isle of Mandaiyaaru.

28:42.725 --> 28:47.767
They reigned over the waves of the sea
and dangers of the deep sea.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.475
The home of the Mandaangars!

28:49.600 --> 28:53.184
Weaving nets and building ships
were their primary occupations.

28:54.059 --> 28:55.100
The isle of Vengaadu.

28:55.225 --> 28:59.100
An island filled with icy forests
and snow tigers.

28:59.225 --> 29:01.642
The war armory of the Venkaatars...

29:01.767 --> 29:05.392
...and their life-saving herbs
were beyond compare.

29:05.517 --> 29:06.559
The isle of Mukkaadu.

29:07.225 --> 29:09.142
It encompassed three different forests.

29:09.267 --> 29:11.930
They worship
the majestic elephant god.

29:12.225 --> 29:14.725
Hunting and poetry were the
primary occupations of its people.

29:14.850 --> 29:16.017
The isle of Arathi.

29:16.142 --> 29:19.892
The iron hills and the red soil
reveal the fierce hues of Arathi.

29:20.017 --> 29:23.642
The people here worshipped Semmaali,
a protective tree...

29:23.767 --> 29:27.017
...bathing it with blood
and smearing it on themselves.

29:27.142 --> 29:28.809
Murder was their primary occupation.

29:28.934 --> 29:32.392
Arathars know not the meaning of mercy.

29:32.892 --> 29:34.184
The isle of Perumaachi.

29:34.309 --> 29:37.309
The lush green of its hills
spreads freshness in the heart.

29:37.434 --> 29:38.725
Valor flourished in this land.

29:39.350 --> 29:42.600
Its people are referred to
as Perumanathaans.

29:42.725 --> 29:44.142
War was their occupation.

29:44.267 --> 29:46.892
They worship a fire god
named 'Muthigan'.

29:47.017 --> 29:50.059
Accompanied by Miyasan, a nomad
familiar with the five isles...

29:50.184 --> 29:54.059
...commander Onorato was commissioned
by Emperor Aurelius...

29:54.184 --> 29:58.684
...to select one of the five islands
and slaughter its inhabitants.

29:59.100 --> 30:03.809
Along with the nomad Miyasan, Onorato
set off to carry out this genocide.

30:03.934 --> 30:05.975
THE ROMAN ARMY VESSEL,
DOMAIN OF THREE SEAS

30:15.600 --> 30:16.600
Sire!

30:16.725 --> 30:18.975
The five isles are here!

30:19.100 --> 30:20.142
We have arrived, sire!

30:21.100 --> 30:23.142
This!
This right here!

30:23.267 --> 30:24.309
This is Mukkaadu!

30:26.059 --> 30:28.392
This...
This...

30:28.517 --> 30:30.142
This is Vengaadu!

30:30.267 --> 30:32.600
This... Mandaiyaaru...

30:32.725 --> 30:35.059
Here it is, right here!

30:35.600 --> 30:37.934
And this here... is Arathi!

30:38.059 --> 30:39.809
This is...

30:41.034 --> 30:42.659
Perumaachi!

30:42.784 --> 30:46.784
Please tell me which of the five isles
do you prefer!

30:47.659 --> 30:49.659
Perumaachi!
-Perumaachi?

30:49.784 --> 30:51.367
The gentleman wants Perumaachi!

30:51.825 --> 30:53.159
Perumaachi!

30:53.284 --> 30:54.575
Koduva!

30:56.992 --> 30:59.784
He is Koduvan from Mandaiyaaru.
A good friend of Perumaachi!

30:59.909 --> 31:02.117
With his help,
we can capture Perumaachi!

31:03.325 --> 31:06.075
Aeral! Poruva!
This is the isle of Perumaachi!

31:06.200 --> 31:08.659
Look straight ahead, Poruva!
-It is beautiful, father!

31:15.491 --> 31:17.971
PERUMAACHI

31:25.867 --> 31:27.450
Hello!
-Perumaachi welcomes you!

31:27.575 --> 31:29.117
What a huge net, mother!

31:29.242 --> 31:30.950
Sounds are made using it.
-Coming, sire!

31:31.075 --> 31:33.409
It was gifted by the Mandaangars
to the Perumanathaans!

31:33.534 --> 31:35.575
Sire Senthee!
It is the Mandaangar Koduvan!

31:35.700 --> 31:37.117
Greetings, sire!

31:38.075 --> 31:40.325
Fish from our isle, sire!

31:41.784 --> 31:43.325
This is for you.
-What are these?

31:43.450 --> 31:45.242
Necklaces from Mandaiyaaru!

31:49.450 --> 31:51.284
Koduva!
He is Onorato!

31:51.409 --> 31:53.534
With 25,000 Roman warriors...

31:53.659 --> 31:56.409
...he has set camp in the seas
to capture the Indian subcontinent!

31:56.534 --> 32:00.409
They have chosen Perumaachi
as their training and strategy ground!

32:00.534 --> 32:01.784
What do you say?

32:01.909 --> 32:04.784
The other isles will yield.
Perumaachi will not!

32:04.909 --> 32:05.950
But why?

32:06.784 --> 32:09.367
Perumanathaans know no fear.

32:09.492 --> 32:10.867
That is why we called you.

32:10.992 --> 32:13.659
You show us a way
to capture Perumaachi!

32:13.784 --> 32:17.992
If you go to war with Perumaachi,
the entire Roman army will be massacred!

32:18.117 --> 32:19.700
For it to not happen...

32:19.825 --> 32:23.409
...I will go first,
kill a thousand Perumaachi warriors...

32:23.534 --> 32:26.575
...with my cunning, weaken their might
and send word to you!

32:26.700 --> 32:30.325
Why do foreign men need the help
of Perumaachi folk to build ships?

32:30.450 --> 32:33.617
Are not you people at Mandaiyaaru
renowned for that skill?

32:33.742 --> 32:37.325
We have no manpower in Mandaiyaaru
to build five hundred ships, sire.

32:37.450 --> 32:39.450
Do we not know the strength
of Perumanathaans?

32:39.575 --> 32:41.284
Perfect!

32:41.409 --> 32:43.534
Absolutely perfect!

32:43.659 --> 32:44.950
You know Miyasan, do you not?

32:45.075 --> 32:46.242
I have heard of him.

32:46.367 --> 32:49.700
We all have one hometown.
The world is the hometown of Miyasan!

32:49.825 --> 32:52.575
There is no land I have not visited.
No food I have not tasted.

32:52.700 --> 32:57.659
But I have never tasted food
as delicious as the one in Perumaachi!

32:59.700 --> 33:03.992
Even the dog, Chokki, will lick its food
from every home!

33:04.742 --> 33:05.825
Just like you!

33:06.534 --> 33:09.617
Why do you keep clinging
to your father, Poruva?

33:09.742 --> 33:12.159
Go, dear boy!
Go listen to the tales from the old lady!

33:12.284 --> 33:15.492
Tell him, sire! Wherever he goes,
he is always clinging to his father!

33:15.617 --> 33:16.617
He always ignores me!

33:16.742 --> 33:17.867
Go, Poruva.
-Yes, father.

33:17.992 --> 33:20.784
Why must we go build ships, Koduva?
-I am coming, old lady!

33:20.909 --> 33:23.450
The people of Perumaachi are happy,
are they not?

33:23.575 --> 33:27.117
Of course they are happy.
But do they have knowledge?

33:27.242 --> 33:31.784
They are ready to give work,
money and knowledge of the world, sire.

33:32.284 --> 33:34.742
Knowledge of the world!
Excellent!

33:34.867 --> 33:36.992
Let us check with your son Kanguvan.

33:37.117 --> 33:39.950
Will your son not abide by your decision?

33:40.075 --> 33:41.200
Take them.

33:43.284 --> 33:44.450
Selumara!

33:45.159 --> 33:47.034
Get a hundred warriors ready!

34:06.367 --> 34:08.575
Excellent, sire.
-See you, sire.

34:23.075 --> 34:24.450
Watch your step, Poruva!

34:24.575 --> 34:26.200
Stay focused, Koduva.

34:27.367 --> 34:28.409
Come!

34:37.784 --> 34:39.075
Tell me.
What is the price?

34:39.200 --> 34:40.534
How many coins per head?

34:40.659 --> 34:43.700
Two gold coins per head!
Two gold coins!

34:43.825 --> 34:45.117
For proof of the kills...

34:45.242 --> 34:47.575
...chop and bring me
a hundred right hands.

34:47.700 --> 34:49.784
As evidence of the slaying...

34:49.909 --> 34:52.992
...he asks you to sever and bring
right hands of a hundred Perumanathaans.

34:54.200 --> 34:57.825
Tell him I will sever those right hands
and put them under his left foot!

34:59.992 --> 35:01.992
Sire!
-I trust you, my friend!

35:02.909 --> 35:03.909
Sire...

35:07.117 --> 35:09.159
Climb up,
O Perumaachi warriors!

35:09.950 --> 35:10.950
Chokki!

35:11.075 --> 35:12.825
What is wrong, Poruva?
-Mother! Father!

35:12.950 --> 35:14.534
The dog Chokki is lying there dead!

35:16.075 --> 35:18.034
It was devoured by a wild wolf.

35:18.159 --> 35:19.659
Bury it and stay here, you two.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.325
I will pick you up on my way back.

35:21.450 --> 35:22.909
Alright, Koduva.

35:23.034 --> 35:24.159
Poruva?
-Chokki...

35:24.284 --> 35:25.284
Do not cry, Poruva.

35:37.534 --> 35:39.534
(Nedungaadu,
Central Region)

35:45.409 --> 35:46.950
Let us rest here!

37:08.659 --> 37:11.700
Mother! I hear something
from the direction father went!

37:26.909 --> 37:27.992
I need one hundred hands!

37:28.117 --> 37:30.867
Not a single one less! Let no one escape!
-Ninety five!

37:30.992 --> 37:33.867
Ninety six!
Ninety seven!

37:33.992 --> 37:35.034
Hundred!

37:50.700 --> 37:51.700
Sire...

37:51.825 --> 37:53.325
Gold coins!

37:53.450 --> 37:54.742
Gold coins!

38:01.534 --> 38:03.492
One!

38:03.617 --> 38:05.450
Two!

38:05.575 --> 38:07.200
Three!

38:09.409 --> 38:10.909
Come, Koduva.
-Sire!

38:11.034 --> 38:13.159
How are our Perumaachi warriors?

38:13.284 --> 38:16.034
Onorato is dazzled by their work!

38:16.825 --> 38:19.284
Perumaachi hands are called
'iron hands' for a reason!

38:20.284 --> 38:21.659
Most delighted!

38:21.784 --> 38:23.075
What brings you here?

38:23.200 --> 38:25.909
Onorato requested
another hundred men, sire.

38:26.034 --> 38:27.784
The work needs to be finished faster.

38:27.909 --> 38:29.159
Can I take them along?

38:31.534 --> 38:32.534
Take them and go.

38:46.284 --> 38:47.659
Come, Aeral.
-I am not coming!

38:47.784 --> 38:48.992
Come here, boy!

38:49.117 --> 38:51.117
Why?
-How did you get this?

38:52.284 --> 38:53.992
Let go of me, mother.
-Tell the truth!

38:54.825 --> 38:56.784
And we will come.
-Let go, mother!

38:56.909 --> 38:58.909
Let go. I am going with father!
-Come, Poruva!

39:02.534 --> 39:03.700
Let go, mother!

39:03.825 --> 39:05.700
Poruva!
-I am coming too, father!

39:07.367 --> 39:08.784
(Nedungaadu,
Central Region)

39:14.284 --> 39:15.367
Koduva!

39:15.492 --> 39:17.492
Is this place fine?

39:21.034 --> 39:22.034
For what?

39:23.034 --> 39:24.700
To relax!

40:18.259 --> 40:19.300
Kanga!

40:19.842 --> 40:21.175
Kanga!

40:23.342 --> 40:24.759
Kanga!

40:24.884 --> 40:27.675
In the bloodline of Maaraakkan
who hoisted the flag on the seabed!

40:30.717 --> 40:33.259
From the lineage of Kochaami
who felled a mighty tusker!

40:36.509 --> 40:38.592
As the heir of Ilamban
who vanquished a famine!

40:38.717 --> 40:40.967
The grandson of Thangaiyan
who tore apart a mountain!

40:41.800 --> 40:43.925
The son of Senthee
who ended the evil Chachaangan!

40:45.342 --> 40:47.634
To ascend the peaks of Mandaiyaaru
and capture a cloud!

40:47.759 --> 40:50.050
To climb the trees of Vengaadu
and attack a white tiger!

40:50.175 --> 40:52.342
To step on the isle of Arathi
and sow fear in our foes!

40:52.467 --> 40:55.050
To mount the wild elephant of Mukkaadu
and ride it all around!

40:55.175 --> 40:57.050
There is one and only one!

40:57.175 --> 40:58.259
Our Kanga!

41:14.717 --> 41:17.884
"As a hundred tiger claws
brush and bang against his chest"

41:18.884 --> 41:22.009
"As slithering snakes on withering leaves
stop and freeze in terror"

41:23.009 --> 41:26.134
"As the waves on the island shore
sketch and etch his face"

41:27.259 --> 41:30.259
"As the drums of Perumaachi
reverberate and echo his name"

41:31.717 --> 41:33.634
"There is one and only one... "

41:33.759 --> 41:35.717
"A warrior that war yearns for... "

41:35.842 --> 41:37.800
"Born from the womb of fire... "

41:37.925 --> 41:39.884
"The pride of our isle Perumaachi"

41:40.009 --> 41:42.550
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

41:44.217 --> 41:46.509
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

41:48.384 --> 41:51.259
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

41:52.592 --> 41:55.467
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

42:05.842 --> 42:08.217
Are you well?

42:10.259 --> 42:11.884
Koduva!

42:19.675 --> 42:22.009
Will you blow the conch?

42:22.134 --> 42:24.425
Or shall I?

42:42.592 --> 42:44.134
Come on!

42:44.259 --> 42:46.259
"His courage soars as the sky"

42:46.384 --> 42:48.175
"His life flashes as a sword"

42:48.300 --> 42:50.217
"Righteous is his path"

42:50.342 --> 42:52.175
"War is his intoxication"
-Come on!

42:56.884 --> 42:58.800
"A forest where light penetrates not"

42:58.925 --> 43:00.967
"The forest where he toddled as a child"

43:05.134 --> 43:07.050
"The forest filled with snakes
and red foxes"

43:07.175 --> 43:09.217
"The forest where he slept
in the laps of beasts"

43:13.342 --> 43:15.842
"Clutching on to the whiskers
of a pouncing tiger... "

43:15.967 --> 43:17.509
"... as a child, he learnt to walk"

43:17.634 --> 43:21.425
"As a blazing fire scorched the forest,
attired himself in a beam of that blaze"

43:21.884 --> 43:25.967
"As an embodiment of all
the worlds" valors, he alone stands"

43:26.092 --> 43:28.009
"A great roar resounds"

43:28.134 --> 43:30.092
"Everywhere... Everywhere"

43:30.217 --> 43:32.425
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

43:34.342 --> 43:36.759
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

43:38.592 --> 43:41.467
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

43:42.592 --> 43:45.467
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

43:57.259 --> 43:59.175
"The red soil below"

43:59.300 --> 44:01.342
"The red sky above"

44:01.467 --> 44:03.425
"Blood in his eyes"

44:03.550 --> 44:05.509
"War in his heart"

44:09.634 --> 44:11.800
"The piercing spears
and pouncing arrows... "

44:11.925 --> 44:14.217
"... bend to the will of the valorous one
that he is"

44:18.217 --> 44:20.217
"The thousand obstacles
of the enemy army... "

44:20.342 --> 44:22.467
"... shatter in the blink
of his eye"

44:26.509 --> 44:30.509
"As he arrives on his black horse,
the mist of white is torn apart"

44:30.634 --> 44:32.842
"When the echo of his unsheathed sword
resounds... "

44:32.967 --> 44:34.967
"... fear spreads even in the hearts
of demons"

44:35.092 --> 44:38.800
"If a drop of his breath hits the chest,
your heart will burst into a thousand bits"

44:38.925 --> 44:41.050
"If the ten chisels of his fingers
touch you... "

44:41.175 --> 44:42.884
"... a handful of dust
is all you will be"

44:43.009 --> 44:45.634
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

44:47.384 --> 44:49.634
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

44:51.592 --> 44:54.425
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

44:55.884 --> 44:58.717
"Kanga... Kanga... Kanguva"

45:56.259 --> 45:57.842
Perumaachi!

45:58.509 --> 45:59.509
Victory!

46:04.013 --> 46:05.263
Perumaachi!

46:05.680 --> 46:06.680
Victory!

46:07.972 --> 46:08.972
Victory!

46:10.097 --> 46:11.597
Perumaachi!

46:11.722 --> 46:12.722
Victory!

46:15.055 --> 46:16.763
Father!
-Poruva!

46:16.888 --> 46:18.097
Perumaachi!

46:18.222 --> 46:19.430
Victory!

46:19.555 --> 46:21.305
Father!

46:31.805 --> 46:33.805
Perumaachi!
-Victory!

46:33.930 --> 46:36.013
Kill! Kill!

46:38.597 --> 46:41.430
Father!
Open your eyes and look at me!

46:41.555 --> 46:43.555
He did not mean to do this!

46:43.680 --> 46:44.680
Please spare him!

46:48.722 --> 46:50.722
Please spare him...

46:50.847 --> 46:53.097
Kill! Kill!

47:02.888 --> 47:05.013
He offered gold coins!
That is why I did it!

47:05.138 --> 47:09.472
You expect me to live in submission
to the laws of the five isles forever?

47:09.597 --> 47:12.180
I wanted to do good for my family.
That is why I did it!

47:12.305 --> 47:14.430
Is that wrong?
Is that a sin?

47:14.555 --> 47:16.597
There is forgiveness for every sin,
Koduva!

47:16.722 --> 47:18.847
For theft, we sever the hands!

47:18.972 --> 47:20.888
For a wrong word spoken,
we sever the tongue!

47:21.013 --> 47:22.972
For mocking our honor,
we sever locks of hair!

47:23.097 --> 47:24.513
For molesting a woman...

47:25.472 --> 47:31.305
We sever, we forgive, and we move on.
That is our way of life!

47:32.013 --> 47:33.305
But!

47:33.430 --> 47:37.472
There is one sin
that we can never forgive, Koduva!

47:38.388 --> 47:39.722
That is...

47:39.847 --> 47:42.097
...a betrayal of our race!

47:43.138 --> 47:47.430
Even if we are divided by five isles,
are we not united by language?

47:48.180 --> 47:50.263
The blood of your victims...

47:50.388 --> 47:51.888
...your blood...

47:52.013 --> 47:53.430
...my blood...

47:53.555 --> 47:54.888
Are they not the same?

47:55.013 --> 47:56.180
Brother!

47:58.055 --> 47:59.597
Please do not do this, brother!

48:00.722 --> 48:03.638
I do not have the heart to ask you
to forgive him.

48:03.763 --> 48:05.972
Father...
-If not for me...

48:06.097 --> 48:07.972
...at least for the sake of my son...

48:08.097 --> 48:10.305
My son cannot live without him!
-Father!

48:10.430 --> 48:11.430
Brother!

48:27.055 --> 48:28.222
Perumaachi!

48:28.972 --> 48:30.305
Long live!

48:31.097 --> 48:32.555
Veechura!

48:32.680 --> 48:34.597
The chieftain of Mandaiyaaru!

48:34.722 --> 48:38.972
He has betrayed not only your kind,
but ours too!

48:39.097 --> 48:40.263
Kill him!

48:40.388 --> 48:41.513
Veechura!

48:43.388 --> 48:45.972
What a huge betrayal, Koduva!

48:46.097 --> 48:48.597
My heart trembles!
-Miyasa!

49:08.430 --> 49:11.055
In the bloodline of Pichangan,
who traversed the raging ocean!

49:11.180 --> 49:14.555
The son of Kaiyeyan,
who protected our isle with one arm!

49:14.680 --> 49:18.680
Grandson of Maavesan, who carried a huge
tree on his shoulders and built a ship!

49:18.805 --> 49:19.805
I am Koduvan!

49:20.597 --> 49:21.597
Kanga!

49:21.722 --> 49:25.847
This fire that is burning me now
will destroy you and your race!

49:25.972 --> 49:27.138
Poruva!

49:27.263 --> 49:28.263
My son!

49:29.597 --> 49:31.805
Poruva!

49:33.847 --> 49:37.388
Not just the perpetrator.
His family must be burned, too!

49:37.513 --> 49:39.097
This is the Mandaangar way!

49:39.222 --> 49:40.388
Stop!

49:41.430 --> 49:43.138
Koduvan was afflicted by greed!

49:43.638 --> 49:45.638
That is not a contagious disease!

49:48.388 --> 49:51.638
It does not flow across generations
from the sire and grandsire!

49:51.763 --> 49:53.888
For his sin,
only he must burn!

49:54.013 --> 49:55.097
Not his family!

49:55.888 --> 49:58.638
Let this fire resolve all his sins!

49:58.763 --> 50:01.055
Veechura is right, Kanga.

50:01.180 --> 50:02.763
The family of Koduvan must die.

50:02.888 --> 50:04.097
Mother!
-Kill his family!

50:04.222 --> 50:05.680
Kill! Kill!

50:12.305 --> 50:16.513
Kill! Kill!

50:24.930 --> 50:25.930
Kill his family!

50:29.013 --> 50:33.055
Kill! Kill!
-Kill his family!

50:42.555 --> 50:44.388
Brother!

50:48.222 --> 50:49.763
Give me your word, brother.

50:52.138 --> 50:54.013
The life of my son...

50:56.388 --> 50:57.555
Brother...

50:57.972 --> 50:59.888
...is now your responsibility.

51:20.763 --> 51:22.138
Aeral!

51:22.263 --> 51:23.888
Mother!

51:26.888 --> 51:28.013
Aeral!

51:28.138 --> 51:29.930
Mother!

51:30.888 --> 51:32.347
Do not do it!
-Mother!

51:36.097 --> 51:38.097
Mother!

52:30.847 --> 52:33.638
He is my son.

52:46.222 --> 52:47.597
He is my son!

53:06.930 --> 53:08.347
A 'konni' thorn.

53:08.472 --> 53:10.138
Only found in Kocha hills.

53:10.263 --> 53:11.430
Why did you climb up there?

53:11.555 --> 53:14.055
Seven days ago,
I gazed at the domain of three seas.

53:15.847 --> 53:19.763
A fire was burning at a distance
of 5,000 nautics.

53:19.888 --> 53:22.555
Yesterday, when I climbed Kocha hills...

53:22.680 --> 53:25.430
...it had come closer
at about 3,000 nautics.

53:26.722 --> 53:30.388
I feel that the light from that torch...

53:30.513 --> 53:34.513
...is bringing darkness to Perumaachi.

53:35.805 --> 53:37.930
Son of a traitor!

53:38.055 --> 53:40.805
Son of a traitor!

53:40.930 --> 53:43.680
Son of a traitor!

53:43.805 --> 53:46.388
Son of a traitor!

53:46.513 --> 53:49.138
Son of a traitor!
-Stop!

53:49.263 --> 53:51.597
Son of a traitor!

53:51.722 --> 53:52.722
Stop, I say!

54:00.597 --> 54:01.972
"In the heart of a child... "

54:03.388 --> 54:05.388
"... resides God. "

54:05.513 --> 54:07.638
That is what we say
in Perumaachi.

54:09.597 --> 54:11.097
As you grow...

54:12.097 --> 54:15.472
...because of anger, rage,
likes and dislikes...

54:15.597 --> 54:18.555
...with no place left,
God moves away from the heart.

54:22.097 --> 54:25.222
Do not chase away the God within you.

54:28.888 --> 54:29.972
He has no one.

54:32.847 --> 54:34.097
Embrace him.

54:59.472 --> 55:01.097
The soil of Perumaachi!

55:02.513 --> 55:03.555
Focus!

55:09.180 --> 55:12.388
This is called 'intermediate state'.
You can strike from either side.

55:19.722 --> 55:20.972
Ready?
Stand!

55:21.513 --> 55:22.805
Focus!
-Focus!

55:22.930 --> 55:24.263
Sheathe!
-Sheathe!

55:24.388 --> 55:25.555
Unsheathe!
-Unsheathe!

55:25.680 --> 55:27.805
Right! Pause!
-Right! Pause!

55:40.688 --> 55:42.022
That Mandaangan has fallen!

55:42.147 --> 55:45.855
But I have another way
to capture Perumaachi!

55:46.605 --> 55:48.063
The isle of Arathi!

55:48.188 --> 55:50.855
The chieftain of Arathi!
Uthiran!

55:56.938 --> 55:59.688
Perumaachi and Arathi
have a longstanding feud, sire!

55:59.813 --> 56:02.855
To sever the head of Perumaachi,
you need to join hands with Arathi!

56:04.147 --> 56:06.147
(Arathi)
-Long live Arathi!

56:08.730 --> 56:10.813
Thuppan!
The third son of Uthiran!

56:12.647 --> 56:14.397
Angasan!
The second son of Uthiran!

56:17.688 --> 56:19.022
Arakaalan!
The eldest son!

56:29.397 --> 56:32.105
From the lineage of Naalathar,
who named this land Arathi!

56:37.813 --> 56:41.147
From the bloodline of Chembunalar,
who first held the earthen pot of Chemmali!

56:44.813 --> 56:47.022
He who unleashed the red rain...

56:47.147 --> 56:49.563
The grandson of Rathaga Chathan!

56:54.063 --> 56:55.688
He reigned with a sceptre of terror!

56:55.813 --> 56:56.938
The son of Muchalan!

57:02.397 --> 57:05.730
Father of the three tigers
Thuppan, Angasan and Arakaalan!

57:08.438 --> 57:10.647
The king of the isle of Arathi!

57:15.813 --> 57:18.230
He makes the world shiver!
The one and only Uthiran!

58:36.647 --> 58:39.563
This is the time
to kill the Perumanathaans!

58:40.063 --> 58:41.855
The gold will be yours!

58:41.980 --> 58:43.522
Your score will be settled too!

58:51.355 --> 58:52.355
Arathi!

58:54.772 --> 58:57.897
There is word going about
that 25,000 Roman warriors...

58:58.022 --> 59:00.772
...and the isle of Arathi,
have banded together...

59:00.897 --> 59:02.230
...to destroy Perumaachi.

59:04.563 --> 59:07.438
If you surrender,
you can save everything.

59:08.397 --> 59:10.522
War!
-War!

59:11.480 --> 59:14.313
It is not wise to go to war
without knowing the strength of the foe!

59:14.438 --> 59:15.647
War!

59:17.855 --> 59:21.105
Before the war begins,
the Perumanathaan will light a fire...

59:21.230 --> 59:23.522
...spread all their weapons
and conduct a ritual.

59:26.147 --> 59:29.938
Once that is done,
he will leave to bathe in the wild cascade!

59:31.480 --> 59:35.147
Our warriors must assemble there,
ascend upon those trees...

59:35.605 --> 59:37.397
...and await the Perumanathaan!

59:37.522 --> 59:41.313
Never mind 25,000!
Let a 100,000-150,000 warriors come!

59:41.438 --> 59:43.272
You and I...

59:43.397 --> 59:47.897
Your father, son, mother, daughter...

59:48.022 --> 59:51.897
Your wife,
even the child in her womb...

59:52.022 --> 59:53.772
They all have one word
on their tongue!

59:53.897 --> 59:55.230
"War!"

59:55.355 --> 59:57.063
He will be unarmed.

59:57.188 --> 59:59.480
Like the descent of death,
swoop down...

59:59.605 --> 1:00:03.855
...take the blood from his severed skull
and bring it to Arathi!

1:00:03.980 --> 1:00:06.897
When severed,
my head may fall to the ground...

1:00:07.022 --> 1:00:10.147
...but my forehead and my knees
will never yield!

1:00:10.272 --> 1:00:11.522
I shall never surrender!

1:00:12.022 --> 1:00:13.438
War!

1:00:17.397 --> 1:00:19.605
Shatter the bones of that Perumanathaan!

1:00:19.730 --> 1:00:22.438
I will make a garland out of those bones!

1:00:23.772 --> 1:00:26.230
War!

1:00:26.647 --> 1:00:27.855
I will weave a corset!

1:00:27.980 --> 1:00:29.688
Bring me the skin of that Perumanathaan!

1:00:31.230 --> 1:00:33.772
War!

1:00:34.230 --> 1:00:35.438
For Arathi!

1:00:53.063 --> 1:00:55.813
"O primeval fire...
O unrelenting fire... "

1:00:55.938 --> 1:00:58.688
"O magical fire...
O towering fire... "

1:00:58.813 --> 1:01:01.563
"O pouncing fire...
O plunging fire... "

1:01:01.688 --> 1:01:04.522
"O guardian fire...
O forest fire... "

1:01:10.522 --> 1:01:13.397
"O primeval fire...
O unrelenting fire... "

1:01:13.522 --> 1:01:16.272
"O magical fire...
O towering fire... "

1:01:16.397 --> 1:01:19.105
"O pouncing fire...
O plunging fire... "

1:01:19.230 --> 1:01:21.772
"O guardian fire...
O forest fire... "

1:01:33.730 --> 1:01:36.730
"Before the dawn of time,
we came to be, the first people"

1:01:36.855 --> 1:01:39.480
"That is us"

1:01:39.605 --> 1:01:42.480
"Before the advent of counting,
we showed our strength in numbers"

1:01:42.605 --> 1:01:45.230
"That is us"

1:01:45.355 --> 1:01:48.355
"The surging primordial flames
we witnessed, the first people"

1:01:48.480 --> 1:01:49.813
"We live and thrive on fire"

1:01:49.938 --> 1:01:51.147
"We are the first people"

1:01:55.605 --> 1:01:57.438
"Come, brace your shoulders"

1:01:57.563 --> 1:01:58.897
"Draw out your sword"

1:01:59.022 --> 1:02:00.397
"Take a vow and come on"

1:02:01.605 --> 1:02:03.438
"Come, brace your shoulders"

1:02:03.563 --> 1:02:04.813
"Draw out your sword"

1:02:04.938 --> 1:02:07.230
"Take a vow and come on"

1:02:07.355 --> 1:02:10.147
"O primeval fire...
O unrelenting fire... "

1:02:10.272 --> 1:02:13.063
"O magical fire...
O towering fire... "

1:02:13.188 --> 1:02:15.813
"O pouncing fire...
O plunging fire... "

1:02:15.938 --> 1:02:18.688
"O guardian fire...
O forest fire... "

1:02:42.272 --> 1:02:44.980
"Thunder struck, rain poured,
storms whirled"

1:02:45.105 --> 1:02:47.897
"Mountains fell, waves rose...
Seemed like the end of the world"

1:02:48.022 --> 1:02:50.855
"Rugged earth, the prickly thorn,
the raging wind... "

1:02:50.980 --> 1:02:53.772
"For eons we fought on
and survived, the first people"

1:02:53.897 --> 1:02:56.522
"A spark fell, the forest burned,
rivers too were on fire"

1:02:56.647 --> 1:02:59.522
"Clouds darkened, the land slid,
the seasons erred"

1:02:59.647 --> 1:03:02.480
"We danced in rage,
we bathed in the fire... "

1:03:02.605 --> 1:03:04.855
"... and we rose up,
the first people"

1:03:15.647 --> 1:03:18.397
"As branches shudder,
elephants march... "

1:03:18.522 --> 1:03:20.980
"The hiss of the lizard
foresees the future"

1:03:21.397 --> 1:03:24.313
"The sight of white blood dripping
from the trunk of the holy tree... "

1:03:24.438 --> 1:03:27.313
"... hastens the sickles and spiked maces"

1:03:27.438 --> 1:03:30.022
"Perched atop a rock in the waterfall... "

1:03:30.147 --> 1:03:32.897
"... the firebird screeches from the South"

1:03:33.022 --> 1:03:36.105
"The expectant jackal races in fear... "

1:03:36.230 --> 1:03:38.480
"... as the blazing fire nears"

1:03:38.605 --> 1:03:40.688
"Come, brace your shoulders"

1:03:40.813 --> 1:03:42.188
"Draw out your sword"

1:03:42.313 --> 1:03:44.480
"Take a vow and come on"

1:03:44.605 --> 1:03:46.647
"Come, brace your shoulders"

1:03:46.772 --> 1:03:48.230
"Draw out your sword"

1:03:48.355 --> 1:03:50.438
"Take a vow and come on"

1:03:50.563 --> 1:03:53.355
"O primeval fire...
O unrelenting fire... "

1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:56.313
"O magical fire...
O towering fire... "

1:03:56.438 --> 1:03:59.230
"O pouncing fire...
O plunging fire... "

1:03:59.355 --> 1:04:01.938
'O guardian fire...
O forest fire... '

1:04:22.730 --> 1:04:27.563
You are going to bathe unarmed,
O Perumaachi warriors. Tread carefully!

1:05:21.897 --> 1:05:23.063
Dhanalaa!

1:05:39.980 --> 1:05:42.063
Beyond the scent
of the damp soil...

1:05:44.355 --> 1:05:46.897
Beyond the scent
of the forthcoming rain...

1:05:47.022 --> 1:05:49.897
...the scent of blood
prevails here.

1:05:50.647 --> 1:05:51.897
Fire point formation!

1:05:53.147 --> 1:05:54.355
To the right!

1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:55.647
To the left!

1:05:55.772 --> 1:05:56.855
To the forefront!

1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:01.772
To the south!

1:06:21.063 --> 1:06:23.938
O forest...

1:06:24.063 --> 1:06:26.105
O forest...

1:06:26.230 --> 1:06:27.480
You are within me!

1:06:27.605 --> 1:06:28.605
Kill them!

1:06:29.355 --> 1:06:30.563
Hack them away!

1:08:00.355 --> 1:08:01.355
Angasa!

1:08:31.730 --> 1:08:33.272
Poruva!
-Kanga!

1:08:33.397 --> 1:08:34.397
Bring my sword!

1:08:43.688 --> 1:08:46.563
That sword belongs to Kanguvan, Poruva!
Where are you taking it?

1:09:10.438 --> 1:09:12.438
Kill them swiftly!

1:09:32.563 --> 1:09:33.563
Come on!

1:09:58.230 --> 1:10:00.438
Kanga!

1:10:00.563 --> 1:10:01.563
My sword!

1:10:20.605 --> 1:10:23.938
The grandson of Kaiyeyan,
who protected our isle with one arm!

1:10:28.855 --> 1:10:32.397
The one who saved Mandaiyaaru from the
tsunami, the one whom you burnt alive...

1:10:32.522 --> 1:10:33.938
Koduvan!
And I am his son!

1:10:44.688 --> 1:10:45.813
Poruvan!

1:10:45.938 --> 1:10:47.522
He has won over his enemy!

1:11:07.522 --> 1:11:08.897
Poruva!
-Poruva!

1:11:09.022 --> 1:11:10.272
Poruva!
-Stop!

1:11:32.605 --> 1:11:34.272
'Eight days from today... '

1:11:34.397 --> 1:11:36.438
'... Perumaachi summons Arathi for war. '

1:11:36.563 --> 1:11:37.730
"From Kanguvan. "

1:11:41.897 --> 1:11:43.855
Arakkaala! Angasaa!

1:11:50.855 --> 1:11:52.105
Come on!

1:11:58.863 --> 1:12:00.238
People of Perumaachi!

1:12:00.363 --> 1:12:02.905
Poruvan, who tried to kill Kanguvan...

1:12:03.030 --> 1:12:05.530
Sever his head from his body
and bring him in two pieces!

1:12:07.488 --> 1:12:11.447
Much like his father Koduvan,
Poruvan must also be burnt at the stake!

1:12:12.197 --> 1:12:13.447
Bring him to me!

1:12:22.697 --> 1:12:23.697
Poruva!

1:12:32.655 --> 1:12:33.655
Poruva!

1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:45.280
Poruva!

1:12:48.697 --> 1:12:50.405
I only saw you as a child.

1:12:50.530 --> 1:12:52.405
I did not see the anger in you.

1:12:52.530 --> 1:12:53.530
Come out, Poruva!

1:12:58.280 --> 1:13:02.197
Like the wind slashed by a sword,
swung at someone else...

1:13:02.322 --> 1:13:04.530
...you were unintentionally scarred.

1:13:04.655 --> 1:13:07.072
Please... forgive me.

1:13:07.197 --> 1:13:08.197
Poruva!

1:13:11.988 --> 1:13:13.238
Poruva!

1:13:16.405 --> 1:13:17.655
Poruva!

1:13:17.780 --> 1:13:19.905
In your eyes,
killing me is the right thing to do!

1:13:20.030 --> 1:13:21.072
Kill me!

1:13:23.738 --> 1:13:25.530
But before that,
I have a duty to finish.

1:13:27.822 --> 1:13:29.530
I must protect the soil
that raised me!

1:13:31.030 --> 1:13:32.572
I must protect my people!

1:13:35.530 --> 1:13:38.863
I cannot die knowing
my home is in danger, Poruva!

1:13:42.072 --> 1:13:43.322
But!

1:13:43.447 --> 1:13:45.113
I give you my word!

1:13:45.655 --> 1:13:48.905
I will die by your hand!

1:13:49.530 --> 1:13:54.780
I swear it upon the soil of Perumaachi,
which I value more than my own life!

1:13:55.447 --> 1:13:57.405
I swear it!

1:14:31.113 --> 1:14:32.113
Why is he back here?

1:14:33.947 --> 1:14:35.072
It is alright, Poruva.

1:14:35.197 --> 1:14:37.947
Kill! Kill!
-He deserves to be burned alive!

1:14:38.072 --> 1:14:39.072
This is wrong!

1:14:40.030 --> 1:14:42.280
He is just a child!
Please stop!

1:14:42.405 --> 1:14:43.447
Stop!

1:14:43.572 --> 1:14:45.155
He is a child...

1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:46.530
What happened to Kanguvan?

1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:49.530
Take cover, Poruva!
-You traitorous swine!

1:14:49.655 --> 1:14:52.030
My brethren!
This is wrong!

1:14:52.155 --> 1:14:53.405
This is wrong...

1:14:54.072 --> 1:14:55.238
Take cover!

1:14:55.363 --> 1:14:57.488
Poruva...
Stop, everyone!

1:14:57.613 --> 1:14:59.030
Sever his head!

1:15:01.613 --> 1:15:02.613
Stop!

1:15:07.572 --> 1:15:09.405
Stop!
-Kill! Kill!

1:15:09.530 --> 1:15:11.613
Stop! Do not do it!
-Stop!

1:15:11.738 --> 1:15:14.530
Had we listened to Veechura
and killed him that day...

1:15:14.655 --> 1:15:16.947
...he would not have plunged the sword
into your heart.

1:15:17.072 --> 1:15:18.363
Nothing to consider, sire!

1:15:18.488 --> 1:15:21.280
He wishes to see his parents.
Send him to them!

1:15:21.405 --> 1:15:22.655
Kill him!

1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:25.280
Hack him into pieces
and fling him in all four directions!

1:15:25.405 --> 1:15:27.530
Would anyone raise a stinging snake?

1:15:27.655 --> 1:15:30.488
Even his ashes must not remain
in the winds of Perumaachi!

1:15:30.613 --> 1:15:32.238
Kill him!
-Everybody!

1:15:32.905 --> 1:15:35.697
With the methods each of you
propose to kill him...

1:15:35.822 --> 1:15:38.697
...first kill me and then kill him!

1:15:40.030 --> 1:15:43.280
I promised his mother
I would protect him with my life.

1:15:43.405 --> 1:15:46.822
Let my promise die after my death!

1:15:46.947 --> 1:15:48.030
What are you saying?

1:15:48.822 --> 1:15:51.613
Are all of the words of the clan
falling on deaf ears?

1:15:51.738 --> 1:15:54.947
Can you not see the fury in his eyes?

1:15:59.447 --> 1:16:02.905
The spark which started
when his parents were burnt alive.

1:16:03.988 --> 1:16:06.572
Now it is growing...

1:16:06.697 --> 1:16:09.863
...and burning like a wildfire in his eyes.

1:16:11.738 --> 1:16:13.530
That is all my eyes can see.

1:16:17.197 --> 1:16:19.988
Let that wildfire not destroy Perumaachi.

1:16:20.113 --> 1:16:21.655
Let it destroy the dark forest.

1:16:22.363 --> 1:16:24.988
Leave Poruvan
at Tiger Rock in the dark forest.

1:16:25.113 --> 1:16:26.738
This is my order!

1:16:26.863 --> 1:16:28.488
This is the decision of Muthigan!

1:16:30.155 --> 1:16:31.697
A right decision!

1:16:31.822 --> 1:16:34.905
Poruvan would not last
even four hours there!

1:16:35.030 --> 1:16:37.155
Tigers would surround him
and kill him!

1:16:39.655 --> 1:16:42.488
Kill! Kill!

1:16:42.613 --> 1:16:44.947
Kill!
-Kill Poruvan! Kill the crook!

1:16:45.072 --> 1:16:46.488
Kill!
-Kill the traitor!

1:16:46.613 --> 1:16:49.113
Kill the crook!
-Everyone!

1:16:49.238 --> 1:16:50.572
Kill!
-Stop!

1:16:50.697 --> 1:16:51.863
Kill!

1:16:51.988 --> 1:16:53.697
Stop!

1:17:01.655 --> 1:17:05.905
If Poruvan must go to the dark forest,
I will go with him, father!

1:17:22.530 --> 1:17:26.113
He who betrayed Perumaachi
must not live in this world!

1:17:26.238 --> 1:17:29.572
Anyone who endorses that betrayal
must not remain in Perumaachi either!

1:17:31.697 --> 1:17:32.905
No...

1:17:33.738 --> 1:17:36.905
No one who went to the dark forest
has ever returned alive.

1:17:37.447 --> 1:17:39.530
Tell your son to not go, Senthee!

1:17:41.488 --> 1:17:45.197
Will you give your life for the one
who tried to kill you, Kanga?

1:17:48.488 --> 1:17:50.238
Tell Kanguvan to not go, sire!

1:18:33.197 --> 1:18:34.197
Poruva?

1:18:35.447 --> 1:18:38.280
It does not matter if your heart and mine
are at a distance.

1:18:38.780 --> 1:18:41.988
But you need to stay close to me,
Poruva.

1:18:43.488 --> 1:18:45.905
This mesmerizing dark forest...

1:18:46.030 --> 1:18:48.488
...can devour you
within the blink of an eye.

1:18:49.530 --> 1:18:51.238
Please listen to me.

1:18:51.363 --> 1:18:52.905
I need to stay close to you.

1:19:08.822 --> 1:19:11.030
Come down, O flock of crows!

1:19:11.155 --> 1:19:13.155
Come down, feast and give way!

1:19:13.780 --> 1:19:16.197
Come down, O flock of crows!

1:19:16.322 --> 1:19:17.780
Angasaa!

1:19:26.197 --> 1:19:27.655
Open up, O sky!
-Open up, O sky!

1:19:27.780 --> 1:19:30.988
Open up for Angasan and Arakaalan
to enter the gates of the next world!

1:19:31.113 --> 1:19:32.113
Open up, O sky!

1:19:34.197 --> 1:19:36.738
Come down, O flock of crows!

1:19:47.863 --> 1:19:51.488
The gates must open for your sons to enter
the next world, Uthira!

1:19:51.613 --> 1:19:54.738
The crows must descend here
and accept the feast.

1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:57.197
We have offered varieties of meat...

1:19:57.322 --> 1:20:00.738
...but not a single crow
has descended!

1:20:06.363 --> 1:20:08.738
Seek a feast, do you not?

1:20:11.488 --> 1:20:17.322
Will not the blood and hearts
of a hundred lives suffice?

1:20:17.447 --> 1:20:22.863
Hear me, O crows, who prevent the souls
of my sons to move on to the new world!

1:20:22.988 --> 1:20:25.530
This is the promise of Uthiran!

1:20:26.697 --> 1:20:30.738
I shall rip out the heart of Kanguvan
with my own hands...

1:20:30.863 --> 1:20:37.780
...and use his blood to purify the path
my sons take to go to the new world!

1:20:38.738 --> 1:20:41.530
O flock of crows!

1:21:04.572 --> 1:21:05.947
Come on!

1:21:22.238 --> 1:21:23.655
The war begins in three days.

1:21:23.780 --> 1:21:27.155
You have sworn upon the souls
of your deceased sons.

1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:32.030
You and your race will never see peace
if you do not kill Kanguva, Uthira!

1:21:44.572 --> 1:21:45.572
Mother!

1:21:46.572 --> 1:21:48.280
Mother!

1:21:49.113 --> 1:21:50.863
Mother!

1:21:54.197 --> 1:21:55.197
Poruvan?

1:21:56.488 --> 1:21:57.488
Poruva!

1:22:00.113 --> 1:22:01.113
Mother!

1:22:02.072 --> 1:22:03.072
Mother!

1:22:05.072 --> 1:22:06.113
Poruva!

1:22:06.738 --> 1:22:08.363
Mother!

1:22:09.988 --> 1:22:10.988
Mother!

1:22:12.405 --> 1:22:13.447
Mother!

1:22:17.655 --> 1:22:19.155
Mother!

1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:20.363
Mother!

1:22:49.447 --> 1:22:50.447
Mother!

1:22:53.863 --> 1:22:54.905
Poruva!

1:22:55.030 --> 1:22:56.738
Go behind!
-Mother!

1:23:24.155 --> 1:23:25.697
Head south, Poruva!

1:23:55.613 --> 1:23:56.655
Mother!

1:24:02.030 --> 1:24:03.030
Mother!

1:24:04.572 --> 1:24:05.572
Mother!

1:24:10.488 --> 1:24:11.822
Go behind!

1:24:11.947 --> 1:24:13.238
Mother!

1:24:34.155 --> 1:24:35.155
Poruva!

1:24:45.363 --> 1:24:46.363
Poruva!

1:26:23.247 --> 1:26:28.830
"Gaze upon the soil
that quenches the thirst of its diggers"

1:26:28.955 --> 1:26:34.788
"Gaze upon the tree
that gives restful shade to its cutters"

1:26:34.913 --> 1:26:40.705
"Gaze upon the flower whose fragrance
wafts in the wind that plucked it"

1:26:40.830 --> 1:26:46.830
"Gaze upon the stone that bestows a statue
to the hands that chisel it"

1:26:46.955 --> 1:26:52.830
"Without forgiveness,
the world fills with emptiness"

1:26:52.955 --> 1:26:58.205
"With forgiveness,
the heart turns burdenless"

1:26:59.122 --> 1:27:04.872
"Without forgiveness,
the world fills with emptiness"

1:27:04.997 --> 1:27:10.205
"With forgiveness,
the heart turns burdenless"

1:27:22.830 --> 1:27:28.372
"Like the waves that batter the shore,
revenge seethes within you"

1:27:28.497 --> 1:27:34.497
"Like the calm that reigns in the deep sea,
serenity bides in the forgiving heart"

1:27:34.622 --> 1:27:40.913
"By doing it wrong and doing wrong,
man learns a little"

1:27:41.038 --> 1:27:45.955
"If every wrong seeks punishment,
ashes are all that will remain"

1:27:47.122 --> 1:27:52.872
"What sin did the tree commit
to shed tears of leaves?"

1:27:52.997 --> 1:27:59.663
"Once spring abounds,
it extends a smile of flowers"

1:28:01.997 --> 1:28:07.830
"Without forgiveness,
the world fills with emptiness"

1:28:07.955 --> 1:28:13.330
"With forgiveness,
the heart turns burdenless"

1:28:14.163 --> 1:28:19.830
"Without forgiveness,
the world fills with emptiness"

1:28:19.955 --> 1:28:25.288
"With forgiveness,
the heart turns burdenless"

1:29:08.788 --> 1:29:09.788
Mother...

1:29:12.122 --> 1:29:13.122
Father...

1:29:21.747 --> 1:29:22.747
Mother!

1:29:30.622 --> 1:29:31.913
Poruva!

1:29:40.497 --> 1:29:42.038
Father...

1:29:52.622 --> 1:29:58.455
"From the warmth of its dung,
I can tell how far the elephant has gone"

1:29:58.580 --> 1:30:03.705
"From the depth of its footprints,
I can tell how much the tiger weighs"

1:30:04.747 --> 1:30:10.455
"From a flutter in the wing of a dragonfly,
I can tell when a raindrop will fall"

1:30:10.580 --> 1:30:16.163
"From the trail of a sparrow,
I can tell where the waterfall is"

1:30:17.080 --> 1:30:22.663
"I know every inch
of this swaying wilderness"

1:30:22.788 --> 1:30:29.580
"O dear son, but your heart alone
is an indecipherable puzzle"

1:30:31.997 --> 1:30:37.830
"Without forgiveness,
the world fills with emptiness"

1:30:37.955 --> 1:30:43.122
"With forgiveness,
the heart turns burdenless"

1:30:44.038 --> 1:30:49.580
"Without forgiveness,
the world fills with emptiness"

1:30:49.705 --> 1:30:55.163
"With forgiveness,
the heart turns burdenless"

1:31:27.497 --> 1:31:28.747
You have disgraced yourself.

1:31:28.872 --> 1:31:30.830
You have lost your honor.

1:31:32.580 --> 1:31:36.247
You vowed your sons
would subdue Perumaachi.

1:31:36.372 --> 1:31:38.038
But they have returned as corpses.

1:31:39.997 --> 1:31:45.288
We Romans have no further need
for you barb... barbarians.

1:31:45.413 --> 1:31:47.580
We will kill Kanguvan ourselves.

1:31:47.705 --> 1:31:51.288
Return the gold you took from us.

1:32:02.247 --> 1:32:04.997
Swallow your words.

1:32:05.122 --> 1:32:07.705
Only then will I remove the coins
out of your mouth!

1:32:20.413 --> 1:32:24.622
From the moment my sons were killed,
this war was no longer about gold!

1:32:24.747 --> 1:32:26.080
But for our race!

1:32:31.330 --> 1:32:33.413
Kanguvan...

1:32:34.247 --> 1:32:37.372
His death will be at my hands!

1:32:38.872 --> 1:32:41.288
Anyone who comes to kill him...

1:32:41.413 --> 1:32:44.705
Even if they are 25,000 Roman warriors...

1:32:47.413 --> 1:32:48.788
Only, I will kill him!

1:32:52.205 --> 1:32:57.580
It is not right the feud with Kanguvan
turns the Romans into an enemy of Arathi.

1:32:57.705 --> 1:33:00.455
Kanguvan must be killed
before the war begins.

1:33:00.580 --> 1:33:01.622
How can that be done?

1:33:04.063 --> 1:33:07.813
It is worrying that Kanguvan is not
in Perumaachi when the war begins.

1:33:09.188 --> 1:33:13.438
Had Kanguva abided by my words,
he would have remained my son.

1:33:14.063 --> 1:33:17.105
Because he felt bound by an oath
to a mother...

1:33:18.355 --> 1:33:20.188
...he has risen as a king!

1:33:20.313 --> 1:33:22.188
He has ventured into the dark forest.

1:33:22.313 --> 1:33:27.897
No forest can ever contain
a fire or Kanguva!

1:33:29.188 --> 1:33:30.397
Where are you going?

1:33:30.522 --> 1:33:33.522
To the white forest for gathering herbs
that will be of aid in wartime.

1:33:33.647 --> 1:33:37.397
The path to that forest is covered by snow.
Hold onto the rope and tread carefully.

1:33:37.522 --> 1:33:38.813
A lonely, lonely goat...

1:33:38.938 --> 1:33:41.397
Searching for grass to eat,
rushes into the forest.

1:33:47.272 --> 1:33:50.522
The Arathars are the ones who will die.
Why must we go pluck herbs for that?

1:33:51.938 --> 1:33:53.355
Left!

1:33:53.480 --> 1:33:56.480
Does the herb know whose blood
is spilt?

1:33:56.605 --> 1:33:57.605
True!

1:33:58.522 --> 1:33:59.563
Straight!

1:34:03.980 --> 1:34:05.188
Right!

1:34:05.938 --> 1:34:07.105
Bend!

1:34:08.897 --> 1:34:10.188
Ascend!

1:34:20.355 --> 1:34:21.397
Manjathi!

1:34:22.855 --> 1:34:23.980
Manjathi!

1:34:24.105 --> 1:34:25.813
Manjathi!

1:34:27.147 --> 1:34:29.855
The rope of Manjathi, who was ahead,
has been cut. She is missing!

1:34:29.980 --> 1:34:30.980
Join!

1:34:40.438 --> 1:34:41.438
Manjathi!

1:34:42.522 --> 1:34:45.147
Your rope was severed.
What are you doing here?

1:34:58.647 --> 1:35:02.855
The Arathars have you surrounded
on all four sides!

1:35:14.188 --> 1:35:17.938
Before the tenth drop falls,
Kanguva must come here!

1:35:18.063 --> 1:35:19.147
Call him!

1:35:19.272 --> 1:35:23.480
If he does not come, one head will roll
for every drop that spills!

1:35:24.188 --> 1:35:25.188
Tell him!

1:35:28.813 --> 1:35:30.188
Brother Kanga!

1:35:30.313 --> 1:35:33.313
We are surrounded by fifteen Arathars!

1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:40.355
If you do not come, Thuppan says
he will kill all twenty five of us!

1:35:41.688 --> 1:35:43.105
Come, brother!

1:35:44.105 --> 1:35:45.105
Come on!

1:35:46.147 --> 1:35:47.605
Brother Kanga!

1:36:20.063 --> 1:36:21.605
What does Kanguva have to say?

1:36:21.730 --> 1:36:22.813
Is he coming?

1:36:26.022 --> 1:36:27.397
Brother is right!

1:36:28.563 --> 1:36:30.938
What is he saying?
-Yes! Brother is right!

1:36:31.063 --> 1:36:33.688
What did your brother say?
What did he say?

1:36:33.813 --> 1:36:36.897
I will tell you what he said!

1:36:38.105 --> 1:36:39.730
What did he say?
Tell me!

1:36:39.855 --> 1:36:43.230
"There are only fifteen Arathars. "

1:36:43.355 --> 1:36:45.105
"There are twenty five of you. "

1:36:45.230 --> 1:36:50.272
"Twenty five of you can kill
fifteen of them, can you not?", he asks!

1:36:52.730 --> 1:36:57.688
This snowy ground has been a blank canvas
for far too long!

1:36:57.813 --> 1:37:03.022
Brother wants us to paint it red!

1:37:13.188 --> 1:37:14.188
Come on!

1:37:15.272 --> 1:37:17.313
Courage soars as the sky!

1:37:17.438 --> 1:37:19.188
Life flashes as a sword!

1:37:19.313 --> 1:37:20.688
Search and behead them!

1:37:20.813 --> 1:37:22.230
Righteous is our path!

1:37:22.730 --> 1:37:24.730
War is our intoxication!

1:37:41.147 --> 1:37:42.230
Sheath!
-Sheath!

1:37:43.313 --> 1:37:44.563
Unsheathe!
-Unsheathe!

1:37:49.188 --> 1:37:50.730
Come on!

1:37:50.855 --> 1:37:52.147
Roll!

1:37:53.188 --> 1:37:54.730
Pounce!
-Pounce!

1:38:16.063 --> 1:38:17.147
Fire up!

1:39:45.522 --> 1:39:46.522
Thuppan...

1:39:47.730 --> 1:39:50.355
...and the entire band of Arathars
who were with him...

1:39:51.688 --> 1:39:52.730
...we have killed.

1:39:58.022 --> 1:39:59.480
We have won, brother!

1:40:00.272 --> 1:40:01.272
We have won!

1:40:06.063 --> 1:40:09.480
O mighty women of Perumaachi,
we have won!

1:40:17.022 --> 1:40:18.022
(The Rock of Justice)

1:40:28.855 --> 1:40:29.855
Perumaachi!

1:40:30.813 --> 1:40:31.813
Mukkaatar!

1:40:32.647 --> 1:40:33.730
Venkaatar!

1:40:35.605 --> 1:40:36.688
Mandaangar!

1:40:36.813 --> 1:40:37.813
Speak, Senthee.

1:40:37.938 --> 1:40:39.688
With war looming...

1:40:39.813 --> 1:40:42.855
...the third son of Uthiran
laid his hand on our women!

1:40:42.980 --> 1:40:44.855
We have gathered
for an investigation!

1:40:57.147 --> 1:40:59.688
Call forth my youngest son Thuppan!

1:41:00.688 --> 1:41:02.355
I will question him!

1:41:02.813 --> 1:41:05.105
He cannot be called!
-We will drag him!

1:41:25.647 --> 1:41:26.813
Thuppa!

1:41:42.438 --> 1:41:44.022
Where is my son?

1:41:44.147 --> 1:41:47.730
The Perumaachi women are in the right!
-No, they are in the wrong!

1:41:49.272 --> 1:41:51.230
Where is my son?

1:41:51.355 --> 1:41:53.438
What is done in self-defence
is not a crime!

1:41:54.605 --> 1:41:56.688
Where is my son?

1:41:56.813 --> 1:41:58.772
Perumanathaans listen to no one!

1:41:58.897 --> 1:42:01.688
Without our consent,
they killed Thuppan!

1:42:03.063 --> 1:42:05.563
Where is my son?

1:42:06.438 --> 1:42:11.563
Are not the tribunal of elders responsible
for investigating crimes across the isles?

1:42:15.980 --> 1:42:18.188
We are on the rock of justice, Uthira!

1:42:18.313 --> 1:42:20.147
Blood must not be spilled here!

1:42:20.272 --> 1:42:22.647
Thuppan is the son of a king!

1:42:22.772 --> 1:42:25.855
A prince can part with his life
only in war!

1:42:26.938 --> 1:42:28.355
His life is gone.

1:42:28.938 --> 1:42:31.813
Does that not mean war has begun?

1:42:32.272 --> 1:42:34.438
This is no longer the rock of justice!

1:42:34.563 --> 1:42:36.063
It is the rock of war!

1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:41.063
Who stands with me?

1:42:41.188 --> 1:42:42.855
Mandaangars!
-Mukkaatars!

1:42:42.980 --> 1:42:44.772
Who stands against me?

1:42:44.897 --> 1:42:46.647
Perumanathaans!
-Venkaatars!

1:43:15.397 --> 1:43:17.355
The Perumanathaans know no fear?

1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:18.897
Watch him run away afraid!

1:43:27.188 --> 1:43:28.188
Miyasan!

1:43:29.188 --> 1:43:32.897
The joy of watching Perumanathaans
flee in fear...

1:43:33.772 --> 1:43:35.105
Senthee!

1:43:35.230 --> 1:43:37.272
Going to the heavens, are you?

1:43:37.813 --> 1:43:38.813
Go!

1:43:38.938 --> 1:43:43.522
Tell my sons I will kill Kanguvan
and send him there!

1:43:55.813 --> 1:43:59.938
Is it enough for just the two of us to know
war has begun, Uthira?

1:44:00.063 --> 1:44:02.022
Must Kanguvan not know, too?

1:44:16.355 --> 1:44:18.688
Who are the enemies of Perumaachi?

1:44:19.730 --> 1:44:22.063
Must its next king not know?

1:44:23.438 --> 1:44:25.272
Aaraa!

1:44:51.355 --> 1:44:53.313
Only now has war begun!

1:44:53.438 --> 1:44:54.438
Come on!

1:45:15.313 --> 1:45:16.563
Mukkaatar!

1:45:18.980 --> 1:45:20.522
Mandaangar!

1:45:23.730 --> 1:45:25.230
Arathar!

1:45:40.730 --> 1:45:42.105
Kanga!

1:45:42.230 --> 1:45:43.647
Father!

1:46:10.147 --> 1:46:13.730
Three hundred boats are coming our way
from a distance of 90 nautics!

1:46:13.855 --> 1:46:16.105
Arathi warriors are coming to destroy us!

1:46:16.230 --> 1:46:19.022
Before the sun slices in the east...

1:46:19.147 --> 1:46:23.563
...sever the necks of Perumanathaans
and offer them to Arathi!

1:46:25.730 --> 1:46:27.938
Kanga is in the forest.
Senthee is in the mountain.

1:46:28.063 --> 1:46:30.563
They have decided this is the right time
to attack us.

1:46:46.313 --> 1:46:47.313
Stop!

1:46:48.355 --> 1:46:50.397
The dark forest
is filled with flame torches!

1:46:50.522 --> 1:46:53.522
The terrified Perumanathaans
are hiding there, Uthira!

1:46:58.438 --> 1:47:00.397
Steer our ships towards the dark forest!

1:47:03.980 --> 1:47:04.980
What do we do now?

1:47:06.188 --> 1:47:08.022
Look there, sire!

1:47:13.772 --> 1:47:18.230
The Arathi army that came to attack us
are heading to the dark forest! Why?

1:47:18.355 --> 1:47:19.897
Shall I answer that?

1:47:20.022 --> 1:47:22.605
If an ambush of tigers roars as one...

1:47:25.438 --> 1:47:27.605
If lightning on the horizon
descends down...

1:47:30.313 --> 1:47:32.563
If the enemy fleet changes course...

1:47:35.272 --> 1:47:37.313
...there can only be one reason!

1:47:37.438 --> 1:47:39.105
Kanga!

1:47:40.355 --> 1:47:41.355
"O leader"

1:47:42.772 --> 1:47:43.772
"My leader"

1:47:45.605 --> 1:47:46.605
"O leader"

1:47:47.897 --> 1:47:48.897
Come on!

1:47:49.897 --> 1:47:51.105
Come on!

1:47:51.230 --> 1:47:52.647
"O leader"

1:47:52.772 --> 1:47:54.480
O blood of Arathi!
-"My leader"

1:47:54.605 --> 1:47:56.272
Conquer Perumaachi!

1:47:56.397 --> 1:47:57.397
"O leader"

1:48:05.647 --> 1:48:08.563
Hide here, Poruva.
You will be safe!

1:48:10.105 --> 1:48:12.105
I need to protect my Perumaachi!

1:48:15.563 --> 1:48:18.188
After I vanquish the foes of my people...

1:48:18.313 --> 1:48:19.897
War!

1:48:22.063 --> 1:48:23.480
...I will stand before you.

1:48:24.647 --> 1:48:26.480
As I promised you...

1:48:27.355 --> 1:48:30.397
...you can kill me yourself.

1:48:43.230 --> 1:48:45.188
There will be
more than 500 Arathi soldiers.

1:48:45.313 --> 1:48:46.772
How will you fight them, Kanga?

1:48:46.897 --> 1:48:49.397
Trees that yield not to the wind.

1:48:52.355 --> 1:48:54.272
River that yields not to the rocks.

1:48:56.897 --> 1:48:59.230
Darkness that yields not to light.

1:49:00.772 --> 1:49:04.147
Pride of having the forest
as our protector in all directions!

1:49:04.272 --> 1:49:07.605
Are these not enough
for us to defeat the Arathar army?

1:49:07.730 --> 1:49:09.147
We will face them!

1:49:10.188 --> 1:49:12.230
We will deface them!

1:49:22.813 --> 1:49:24.897
"O warrior"

1:49:25.022 --> 1:49:27.397
"You march forth like an army"

1:49:27.522 --> 1:49:30.522
"Are you the foundation of infinite valor?"

1:49:30.647 --> 1:49:33.188
"Are you but one man, or a hundred?"

1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:43.397
"O hero"

1:49:43.522 --> 1:49:46.105
"You break away barriers"

1:49:46.230 --> 1:49:49.313
"Are you the piercing tip of our honor?"

1:49:49.438 --> 1:49:51.313
"Are you the essence of our lives?"

1:49:52.147 --> 1:49:54.813
"War...
Who starts a war?"

1:49:54.938 --> 1:49:57.397
"Who bears the brunt of this war?"

1:49:57.522 --> 1:49:59.730
"War...
Who ends a war?"

1:49:59.855 --> 1:50:02.522
"Is your name etched
in the blood of the foe?"

1:50:55.438 --> 1:50:56.438
Come on!

1:51:02.855 --> 1:51:04.855
Come on up!

1:51:04.980 --> 1:51:05.980
Come on!

1:51:06.105 --> 1:51:08.022
"With the forest as your army"

1:51:08.147 --> 1:51:10.730
"With no obstacles any"

1:51:10.855 --> 1:51:13.230
"Win, O warrior"

1:51:13.355 --> 1:51:15.355
"Vanquish the enmity, O warrior"

1:51:27.063 --> 1:51:29.563
"With the divine fire as your companion"

1:51:29.688 --> 1:51:32.188
"With no one but you as your equal"

1:51:32.313 --> 1:51:34.563
"Fight, O warrior"

1:51:34.688 --> 1:51:36.647
"Soar to the skies, O warrior"

1:51:37.688 --> 1:51:40.272
"Your foes gather before you"

1:51:40.397 --> 1:51:42.938
"The forest stands behind you"

1:51:43.063 --> 1:51:45.522
"Your eyes are rivers of rage"

1:51:45.647 --> 1:51:48.272
"The moment you rise,
soars the pride of our motherland"

1:51:56.355 --> 1:52:00.147
When I hear
their cry of death...

1:52:00.272 --> 1:52:03.688
...my head dances
like the waves in the ocean, Karaikootha!

1:52:20.647 --> 1:52:23.230
It is not the Perumanathaans
who are screaming!

1:52:23.355 --> 1:52:25.355
It is the cry of our Arathi men!

1:52:26.897 --> 1:52:28.063
Nethna!

1:52:44.938 --> 1:52:45.938
Kanga!

1:52:52.730 --> 1:52:54.105
Kanga!

1:53:02.897 --> 1:53:08.563
"By doing it wrong and doing wrong,
man learns a little"

1:53:09.355 --> 1:53:15.230
"If every wrong seeks punishment,
ashes are all that will remain"

1:53:15.355 --> 1:53:21.272
"What sin did the tree commit
to shed tears of leaves?"

1:53:21.397 --> 1:53:26.688
"Once spring abounds,
it extends a smile of flowers"

1:53:26.813 --> 1:53:28.063
My son...

1:53:30.813 --> 1:53:32.022
Come on!

1:53:45.438 --> 1:53:47.688
Kanga!

1:53:50.438 --> 1:53:51.438
Kanga!

1:54:00.188 --> 1:54:01.188
Kanga!

1:54:05.938 --> 1:54:08.063
"Why are you born to someone?"

1:54:09.272 --> 1:54:11.230
"Why are you with someone?"

1:54:12.313 --> 1:54:14.230
"Why do you die for someone?"

1:54:15.397 --> 1:54:17.647
"Nobody knows the answers
to these questions. "

1:54:17.772 --> 1:54:18.855
Kanga!

1:54:25.105 --> 1:54:26.105
Step on it!

1:54:29.813 --> 1:54:31.563
Listen to me, Francis!

1:54:31.688 --> 1:54:33.647
To hell with that kid! Let him go!
-Francis!

1:54:35.022 --> 1:54:36.688
Please, Francis!
-I can't!

1:54:36.813 --> 1:54:37.813
What is with you?

1:54:37.938 --> 1:54:40.230
It's like my life is leaving my body!

1:55:08.593 --> 1:55:11.843
Tie up Poruvan, Nethna!
Kanguvan will come for him!

1:55:17.218 --> 1:55:21.260
The dark forest is yours, Kanga!
You are carrying out a killing spree!

1:55:21.385 --> 1:55:25.385
But this ocean is mine!
Come on!

1:55:45.301 --> 1:55:46.801
Stop!
-Stop the car!

1:55:47.301 --> 1:55:49.260
Francis!
-Are you okay, Francis?

1:55:49.385 --> 1:55:50.843
Francis!
-Get up!

1:55:50.968 --> 1:55:52.093
The boy...
-Francis!

1:55:54.593 --> 1:55:55.801
Drive!
-Francis...

1:55:55.926 --> 1:55:57.176
Move!
-Go, go, go!

1:55:58.718 --> 1:55:59.718
We are on it!

1:56:01.343 --> 1:56:02.426
Francis!
-Tracker!

1:56:02.551 --> 1:56:03.968
Track him!
-The tracker!

1:56:04.760 --> 1:56:06.093
Where is he?
-What the heck?

1:56:06.218 --> 1:56:07.635
How far?
-You're bleeding!

1:56:08.510 --> 1:56:09.885
Go, go, go!

1:56:10.010 --> 1:56:12.051
Take left!
Go!

1:56:25.010 --> 1:56:26.426
That vehicle is here, Francis!

1:56:29.218 --> 1:56:30.843
On!
-On!

1:56:36.093 --> 1:56:37.093
Okay!

1:56:37.801 --> 1:56:38.801
Anyone there?

1:56:38.926 --> 1:56:41.218
Alright troops. Our ride's landing soon
for Zeta.

1:56:41.343 --> 1:56:42.426
Lock and load!
-Francis!

1:56:42.551 --> 1:56:43.718
Let's get moving to the LZ!

1:57:05.926 --> 1:57:08.301
Wait by the truck, Colt! I'll let you know!
-Got it!

1:57:46.676 --> 1:57:47.843
Oh my...
-Colt!

1:57:47.968 --> 1:57:50.343
That's all yours!
Just go wild, darling!

1:57:50.468 --> 1:57:51.718
Go wild, I will!

1:57:52.343 --> 1:57:53.760
Nice work, squad!

1:57:53.885 --> 1:57:55.051
Eyes peeled now!

1:57:55.176 --> 1:57:56.593
We are rolling Zeta out!

1:57:57.218 --> 1:57:58.343
Game on!

1:57:58.926 --> 1:58:00.426
Intruders!
Take them down!

1:58:01.635 --> 1:58:03.343
Secure Zeta now!

1:58:06.010 --> 1:58:07.010
Go, go, go!

1:58:07.593 --> 1:58:08.718
Double up!

1:58:14.135 --> 1:58:15.968
Lock down Zeta!
Move! Move!

1:58:16.093 --> 1:58:17.343
Come on!

1:58:18.968 --> 1:58:20.218
Come on!
-X on the right!

1:58:20.343 --> 1:58:21.468
Y on the left!

1:58:21.593 --> 1:58:24.051
Come on!

1:58:26.718 --> 1:58:28.135
There you are!

1:58:29.218 --> 1:58:31.135
Load Zeta onto the plane now!

1:58:31.260 --> 1:58:33.010
Roger that!
Everyone advance!

1:58:33.135 --> 1:58:34.968
Captain's order!
We are moving Zeta!

1:59:17.051 --> 1:59:18.426
Where is Poruvan?

1:59:21.260 --> 1:59:22.593
Kanga!

1:59:23.051 --> 1:59:24.385
Poruva!

1:59:36.676 --> 1:59:37.926
Kanga!

1:59:51.218 --> 1:59:52.426
Kanga!

1:59:54.801 --> 1:59:57.051
Zeta secured!
Awaiting clearance for take-off!

1:59:57.760 --> 2:00:00.135
Get Zeta to the central dock, squad!

2:00:00.260 --> 2:00:01.676
Move, move, move!

2:00:16.426 --> 2:00:17.426
Mother!

2:00:55.176 --> 2:00:56.176
Come on!

2:01:14.676 --> 2:01:15.676
Mother!

2:01:16.635 --> 2:01:18.117
Poruva!

2:01:19.960 --> 2:01:21.217
The axe!

2:01:32.676 --> 2:01:33.676
Kanga!

2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:37.760
Kanga!

2:01:41.343 --> 2:01:42.343
Mother!

2:01:58.843 --> 2:01:59.843
Kanga!

2:02:45.676 --> 2:02:46.885
Take cover!

2:02:50.801 --> 2:02:51.801
Move up!

2:02:53.801 --> 2:02:55.135
Take him down!

2:03:04.926 --> 2:03:06.635
Put the guns down right now!

2:03:08.301 --> 2:03:09.426
Weapons down!

2:04:22.968 --> 2:04:24.468
Zeta's brain is frying.

2:04:24.686 --> 2:04:26.885
Before the whole neuro center
is toast...

2:04:27.095 --> 2:04:30.551
...cut Zeta's head and bring the brain
secured to Alpha.

2:04:40.385 --> 2:04:41.760
Kanga!

2:04:53.510 --> 2:04:54.510
Kanga!

2:05:02.426 --> 2:05:03.426
Kanga!

2:05:16.176 --> 2:05:17.176
Kanga...

2:05:20.760 --> 2:05:22.760
Let go of the rope, Kanga!

2:05:55.801 --> 2:05:56.801
Poruva!

2:05:58.218 --> 2:06:00.801
If I die,
only one life will perish!

2:06:02.593 --> 2:06:03.968
Do not do it!

2:06:08.885 --> 2:06:12.010
But if you die,
an entire race will perish!

2:06:16.010 --> 2:06:17.926
My life is yours, father!

2:06:21.301 --> 2:06:23.218
Save our people, father!

2:06:35.010 --> 2:06:36.010
Poruva!

2:07:34.968 --> 2:07:35.968
I will kill him!

2:07:43.135 --> 2:07:44.676
"O leader"

2:07:45.801 --> 2:07:47.218
"My leader"

2:07:49.051 --> 2:07:50.510
"O leader"

2:07:54.885 --> 2:07:56.468
"My leader"

2:07:58.760 --> 2:08:00.635
"The dance of time"

2:08:01.176 --> 2:08:03.051
"The dance of time"

2:08:03.718 --> 2:08:07.218
"Turns eons to seconds,
leaping like a speeding horse"

2:08:08.301 --> 2:08:09.593
"The dance of time"

2:08:10.426 --> 2:08:11.843
"The dance of time"

2:08:12.968 --> 2:08:16.385
"Turns space and time to dust,
attacking like a piercing arrow"

2:08:17.968 --> 2:08:22.593
"Saying all that begins will end,
it dances with its matted hair in the wind"

2:08:22.718 --> 2:08:27.218
"Saying all that is dark will dawn,
it burns away worlds in an eternal quest"

2:08:27.343 --> 2:08:29.801
"Severing a bond,
then making the broken to be born again"

2:08:29.926 --> 2:08:31.718
"The dance of time is an endless play"

2:08:31.843 --> 2:08:33.551
"The dance of time"

2:08:52.843 --> 2:08:54.218
"The dance of time"

2:08:55.301 --> 2:08:56.676
"The dance of time"

2:08:57.551 --> 2:09:01.176
"Flows as the blood of love,
spreading through every vein"

2:09:02.218 --> 2:09:03.676
"The dance of time"

2:09:04.551 --> 2:09:06.010
"The dance of time"

2:09:06.885 --> 2:09:10.135
"Amidst this universe of love,
you are but a tiny seed"

2:09:11.385 --> 2:09:15.510
"There may be a moment when the promise
of a man dissolves beneath the seas"

2:09:16.176 --> 2:09:20.051
"But the cord of life that ties two souls
will bind as one above the skies"

2:09:20.801 --> 2:09:23.010
"Plucking away one
and showering a hundred"

2:09:23.135 --> 2:09:26.718
"In the arrogance of nature
resounds the dance of time"

2:09:30.218 --> 2:09:31.218
Bring it on!

2:10:22.426 --> 2:10:26.760
Even if have to die again and again
and be reborn over and over again...

2:10:26.885 --> 2:10:29.718
...I will repay my debt to you, Poruva!

2:10:33.218 --> 2:10:34.218
Kanga?

2:10:44.093 --> 2:10:46.551
You gave up your life for this sinner...

2:10:46.676 --> 2:10:50.051
...and have become my kin
for all eternity!

2:10:58.051 --> 2:10:59.635
He is my son!

2:11:11.635 --> 2:11:13.218
Poruva!

2:11:14.051 --> 2:11:15.343
My son!

2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:33.176
Poruva!

2:11:44.801 --> 2:11:47.093
Uthiran and his three sons
are dead.

2:11:47.218 --> 2:11:49.468
Who will light the pyre of Uthiran?

2:11:49.593 --> 2:11:50.843
Rathaangasan!

2:11:52.301 --> 2:11:53.843
Rathaangasan must not come!

2:11:53.968 --> 2:11:56.843
He was born out of wedlock
to Uthiran and his concubine!

2:11:56.968 --> 2:11:59.260
It is your duty to perform the last rites.

2:11:59.968 --> 2:12:01.718
Rathaangasan will come!

2:12:03.176 --> 2:12:07.468
The arrival of Rathaangasan is akin
to the death of Arathi!

2:12:07.593 --> 2:12:08.968
You light the pyre!

2:12:43.718 --> 2:12:45.343
Rathaangasa!

2:12:49.676 --> 2:12:50.968
Arathi!

2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:47.760
Father?

2:13:47.885 --> 2:13:49.260
Never address me as 'father'!

2:13:49.385 --> 2:13:52.093
You were born to me
and a concubine who was my slave!

2:13:52.218 --> 2:13:54.218
Father...
-You can never become a prince!

2:14:03.218 --> 2:14:04.385
Father...

2:14:05.551 --> 2:14:06.551
Father...

2:14:08.593 --> 2:14:09.926
I asked you...

2:14:10.926 --> 2:14:14.176
...to accept me as your son
and as a prince of Arathi.

2:14:14.926 --> 2:14:16.218
You refused.

2:14:17.301 --> 2:14:18.593
I understand now.

2:14:19.676 --> 2:14:21.510
Not just a mere prince.

2:14:22.343 --> 2:14:25.176
You wished to see me as the king,
did you?

2:14:31.093 --> 2:14:32.093
The son of a concubine!

2:14:32.218 --> 2:14:34.760
You were born to a concubine!
-The son of a concubine?

2:14:34.885 --> 2:14:36.593
You cannot be king!
-Son of a concubine!

2:14:36.718 --> 2:14:37.718
This is not the way!

2:14:38.843 --> 2:14:40.343
I am the son of a concubine?

2:14:43.176 --> 2:14:44.551
The son of a concubine!

2:15:18.885 --> 2:15:21.301
To ascend upon the throne...

2:15:21.426 --> 2:15:25.301
...a shared bloodline
between me and my father will not suffice.

2:15:26.468 --> 2:15:28.135
The blood of another is needed!

2:15:29.135 --> 2:15:32.635
The blood of Kanguva,
who destroyed our clan!

2:15:33.843 --> 2:15:36.135
Rathaangasan!

2:15:36.551 --> 2:15:39.718
Rathaangasan!
-Rathaangasan!

2:15:39.843 --> 2:15:43.301
Rathaangasan!

2:15:43.426 --> 2:15:46.260
Rathaangasan!

2:15:48.218 --> 2:15:51.343
Commander! Zeta's been captured
by someone else!

2:15:58.010 --> 2:15:59.635
Stream!

2:16:12.385 --> 2:16:14.010
The one you see on the screen!

2:16:14.135 --> 2:16:15.135
Francis!

2:16:27.218 --> 2:16:28.635
The name...

2:16:29.593 --> 2:16:30.676
...is...

2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:40.676
...Kanguva!

2:16:50.093 --> 2:16:52.551
Why must such a huge armed force
kidnap this young kid?

2:16:54.343 --> 2:16:58.510
I will cleanse the stain of being born
in the womb of a concubine...

2:16:58.635 --> 2:17:01.010
...with the blood of Kanguvan!

2:17:01.135 --> 2:17:05.051
What is that strange feeling I get
every time I see this boy?

2:17:05.176 --> 2:17:07.135
I have a thousand such questions.

2:17:08.885 --> 2:17:09.885
Only after that...

2:17:11.968 --> 2:17:13.635
...will I sit upon the throne!

2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:15.218
But one thing is for certain.

2:17:16.010 --> 2:17:19.051
We are heading for a great future!

2:17:49.676 --> 2:17:51.176
Kanguva...

2:17:51.843 --> 2:17:52.843
Come!
